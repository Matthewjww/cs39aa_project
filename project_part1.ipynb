    "## Introduction/Background\n",
    "The goal of the project is to generate news headlines from the text of an article. This is a __text summarization__ problem, as the headline of an article should be a one to two sentence summary of what the reader should expect to read in the article. The data set I will be using, nyt_news, was created using news-please, a news web-scraper. The web-scraper is provided a url(s) and searches those sites for articles, then saves the articles as an HTML file, and a JSON file. For my project I used https://www.nytimes.com as the URL to scrape. While news-please creates many fields from the website, the fields I used from the dataset are _title_ and _maintext_, which represent the titles of news articles and the text content of the article.\n"
