The update came as the Tennessee Titans were trying to contain an outbreak that is known to have infected more than a dozen members of the organization — including as many as nine players — and which forced the postponement of the team’s Week 4 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nOn Friday, two more Titans players were found Friday to have tested positive, according to multiple news reports, and on Saturday reports emerged of at least three more cases, involving a ninth player and two more staff members.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/sports/football/nfl-coronavirus-testing-titans.html"}
