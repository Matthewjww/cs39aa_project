But the combined business is set to split next year into three companies based around its materials sciences, agriculture and specialty products divisions. The company agreed to revise its breakup plan last year after pressure from shareholders.\nMr. Liveris, 63, had previously said that he would most likely leave the company this year. He is set to relinquish the role of executive chairman on April 1 and step down from the company’s board in July.\nAfter the departure of Mr. Liveris, Jeff Fettig, the company’s co-lead independent director, will assume the role as a nonemployee executive chairman.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/business/dealbook/dowdupont-andrew-liveris.html"}
