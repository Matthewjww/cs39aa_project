It directs the health secretary to begin the process of creating demonstration projects requiring Medicare to pay the same price for prescription drugs as those sold in Europe and other developed nations, which often have lower prices.\nThe process could take months, if not longer, and it would almost certainly be challenged in court.\nThe order covers all drugs paid for by Medicare — including those sold at pharmacies — and not just those administered in doctors’ offices, as the president initially announced.\n“It is unacceptable that Americans pay more for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same places,” the order says. “Other countries’ governments regulate drug prices by negotiating with drug manufacturers to secure bargain prices, leaving Americans to make up the difference — effectively subsidizing innovation and lower-cost drugs for the rest of the world.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/us/politics/trump-executive-order-drug-prices.html"}
