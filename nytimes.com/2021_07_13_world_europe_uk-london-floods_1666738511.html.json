But a relentless storm on Monday turned into flash flooding in southern England, bringing part of the capital to a standstill.\nThe downpour left surging water spilling into the streets of London, flowing through Underground stations, disrupting public transportation and forcing some residents to evacuate their homes. The authorities issued flood warnings for several neighborhoods and the London Fire Brigade said it received more than 1,000 calls related to flooding in the capital’s west on Monday, which trapped people in cars and damaged houses and commercial buildings.\nFootage of the storm’s aftermath showed cars submerged over their wheels and people huddled under awnings on Portobello Road. Pubs offered food and hot drinks to those taking shelter.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/world/europe/uk-london-floods.html"}
