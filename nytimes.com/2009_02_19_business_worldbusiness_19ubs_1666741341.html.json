The bank admitted conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and agreed to pay $780 million to settle a sweeping federal investigation into its activities.\nIt is unclear how many of its clientsâ€™ names UBS will divulge. Federal prosecutors have been examining about 19,000 accounts at the bank, but UBS ultimately may disclose the identities of only a few hundred customers.\nBut to some, turning over any names at all heralds the end of the secret Swiss bank account, whose traditions date to the Middle Ages.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/19/business/worldbusiness/19ubs.html"}
