The issue, which the company had previously traced to a problem with one of the raw materials used in its test kits, does not affect the reliability of negative results.\nThe F.D.A. categorized the recall, which was first announced last month, as Class I, the most serious type. Use of the tests could have “serious adverse health consequences,” the agency said. People who falsely test positive for the virus may receive unnecessary treatments for Covid-19 and experience delays in being diagnosed with and treated for “the actual cause of the person’s illness,” the agency noted.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/health/home-covid-test-kits.html"}
