That brought the total number of infections to 610. With two more deaths Monday, Hong Kong accounts for 15 of about 60 deaths so far.\nThe authorities said that most of the residents of the contaminated block at Amoy Gardens had already fled, prompting fears that the disease would spread further into the community. Health officials issued an appeal for missing residents to return but said that plans were now being drawn up for the creation of quarantine centers.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/01/news/as-sars-rages-hong-kong-orders-a-quarantine.html"}
