One is plenty. Although a game is officially only 48 minutes long, when you add in all the bells and whistles — halftime, commercial breaks, timeouts, free throws, yelling at refs — it stretches close to three hours. Those hours are stuffed with so much action and drama and gossip and heartache, so much text and subtext, that it feels less like a game than a TV season or a film festival. This is especially true in the playoffs, when the talent pool contracts and all the plots thicken, and the intensity on the floor becomes nearly intolerable and time expands and every loose ball starts to feel monumental, like a famous battle or a solar eclipse.\nOnce the playoffs started, on Aug. 17, I went to every single game. This meant four games a day. It was basketball paradise. I walked from buzzer to tipoff, buzzer to tipoff, buzzer to tipoff, buzzer to tipoff. I saw games so intense they made me nervous even though I didn’t care who won. I saw blowouts so bad they hurt my feelings. I saw a referee doing weird warm-up stretches, like “Thriller” dance moves, before tipoff. I saw a 7-foot-4 man stand on his tiptoes while holding the rim. I saw Utah’s Donovan Mitchell, wearing electric-lime-green shoes, switch direction so hard it looked as if he was going to break his own ankles.\nAfter a couple of days, it was all too much. I felt as if I were mainlining the whole cosmic force of basketball. My attention was shredded. I could hardly process anything. My lower back ached from the hard plastic seats. The arena music was so loud, the flashing lights so bright, that I found myself wishing I had some kind of giant helmet, dark and silent, with pinholes for eyes. Somewhere in the middle of it all, my eyes got so raw and dry that I worried it might be a Covid symptom — but my tests had all come back negative, so I realized my eyes must just be sick from basketball. Time was spilling out everywhere, soaking into the ground. I saw Toronto’s Kyle Lowry, a basketball genius shaped like a minifridge, harangue a referee for minutes on end about how his teammate had been hit in the testicles. I felt simultaneously full and empty, and the action on the floor started to feel like a waking dream, or like distant freeway traffic, or like a meteor shower. I was the ultimate spectator, a pure glutton, gorging all day, stopping only to sleep.\nOut in America, politics was happening. At the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama was roasting Donald Trump; Kamala Harris had become the first woman of color to accept the nomination for vice president. Or so I heard. I didn’t have time for the news anymore. I was busy watching a particularly chippy game between the Clippers and the Mavericks. I watched Luka Doncic hit long, step-back 3-pointers that would have been fireable offenses 10 years ago. Sometimes I forgot to text my family. I had become a citizen of the bubble, lost in the bright urgency of basketball. Even the politics in front of my face faded into the background — after the first few games, it felt normal to see everyone kneeling for the anthem, and my eyes started sliding right over the social-justice messages on the jerseys. I watched Chris Paul systematically explore every possible angle of a jab-step, like a basketball scientist. I watched Dwight Howard dunk so hard it bent the rim, leading to a long delay involving workmen on ladders. But they fixed it, of course, and the game started right back up. Basketball was eternal. Covid couldn’t touch it. Politics couldn’t touch it. The N.B.A. bubble, against all odds, had turned out to be indestructible.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/magazine/nba-bubble.html"}
