She made the comments in a radio interview on Hot 97 while criticizing Eric Adams, calling him “very Trumpian.”\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez spoke highly of Ms. Wiley, a former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, and encouraged voters to rank her first, but she also had praise for Mr. Stringer, whose campaign lost momentum after two allegations of sexual misconduct.\n“I personally have ranked Scott Stringer number two,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think he’s also a strong candidate from a policy perspective.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/nyregion/aoc-stringer-second-ranked.html"}
