That old-fashioned system of shopping, which allowed customers to pay for items over the course of several installments, has gotten a digital makeover for the modern age.\nServices — from the companies Afterpay, Quadpay, Sezzle, Affirm and Klarna — are popping up at the checkout of more and more online stores, offering to help cover the cost of an online purchase by spreading out payment.\nBut whereas layaway, which became popular in the 1920s and ’30s as a method for buying cars, radios, vacuum cleaners and other household items, is a system in which the consumer has to wait to own the item, buy-now-pay-later services provide instant gratification.\nYou may have already seen them beckoning, with offers that appear on the websites of Reformation, Urban Outfitters, Cole Haan, Mansur Gavriel, Ugg and Warby Parker. They have tag lines like: “Payment can wait. Your new look can’t,” and “Shop Now. Enjoy Now. Pay Later.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/fashion/afterpay-quadpay-klarna-affirm.html"}
