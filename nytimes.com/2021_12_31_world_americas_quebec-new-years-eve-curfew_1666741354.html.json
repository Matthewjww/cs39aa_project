The government also banned private indoor gatherings beyond members of the same household, forcing many Quebecers to cancel their New Year’s Eve plans.\nUnder the curfew, which goes into effect at 5 p.m. on Friday, Quebecers will be required to remain indoors from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., and those who break the rules face fines as high as $4,750. (There are some exemptions, such as dog walkers and essential workers in hospitals.)\nMr. Legault said Thursday that the measures were necessary to protect the province’s health care system.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/31/world/americas/quebec-new-years-eve-curfew.html"}
