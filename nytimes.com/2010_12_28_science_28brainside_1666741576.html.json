Hayworth had a most unusual hobby: He built brain-slicing machines in his Los Angeles garage.\nMr. Hayworth, 39, had developed an interest in connectomics  the emerging science of mapping the brain  while conducting neuroscience research at the University of Southern California. He believed that the field needed better equipment.\nSo he set to work building an apparatus that could cut and process mouse brains in a semiautomated fashion, sort of like a deli slicer, and prepare them for analysis under an electron microscope. Soon the contraption began to grow.\n“My wife put up with it,” Mr. Hayworth said. “I spent like $10,000 of our own money on the machine, with no hope of recouping it.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/science/28brainside.html"}
