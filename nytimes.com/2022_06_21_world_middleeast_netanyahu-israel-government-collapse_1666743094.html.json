A new election — Israel’s fifth in less than four years — will not be held until the fall, and could conclude without any bloc winning a majority. Parliament has also yet to be dissolved, and most likely won’t be until next Monday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-government-collapse.html"}
