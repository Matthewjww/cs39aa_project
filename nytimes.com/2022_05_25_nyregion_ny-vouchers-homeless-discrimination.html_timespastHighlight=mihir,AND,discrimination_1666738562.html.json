The investigators made thousands of inquiries seeking to rent homes using a special city voucher for people struggling with evictions and homelessness. But in recorded phone calls, text messages and emails, which were shared with The New York Times, the investigators were repeatedly told that landlords did not rent to such voucher holders.\nIt is illegal in New York City, and in a growing number of places across the nation, for landlords to refuse to accept applications from tenants who depend on vouchers. The defendants in the lawsuit, which was filed on Wednesday in the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, include well-known firms such as Douglas Elliman and teams associated with Re/Max and Coldwell Banker, in addition to dozens of individual brokers and landlords.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/nyregion/ny-vouchers-homeless-discrimination.html?timespastHighlight=mihir,AND,discrimination"}
