It is counting on new electric trucks and cars for much of the growth while adding new revenue streams from software and services.\n“When you look at all the investments we have been making for five years plus, that’s what positions us to really be in execution mode,” G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, told reporters at its technical center north of Detroit during a daylong presentation to investors.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/business/gm-revenue-goals.html"}
