North Korea has made repeated claims about its nuclear capabilities that outside analysts have greeted with skepticism.\n“This is the self-defensive measure we have to take to defend our right to live in the face of the nuclear threats and blackmail by the United States and to guarantee the security of the Korean Peninsula,” a female North Korean announcer said, reading the statement on Central Television, the state-run network.\nThe North’s announcement came about an hour after detection devices around the world had picked up a 5.1 seismic event along the country’s northeast coast.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-test.html?_r=0"}
