There will always be an element, absolutely. Ultimately, people will want to wear what the team’s wearing.”\nThe North Dakota Booster Board chairman, Lowell Schweigert, whose brother Kyle coaches the football team, struggled with the transition. A 1978 graduate who lettered in football and baseball, Schweigert was part of the 11-person committee entrusted with narrowing the options for a new nickname. Schweigert, a financial consultant, said his office was filled with Fighting Sioux memorabilia.\n“For a while, it was a really, really emotional issue for me,” he said. “But after awhile, it was time to take the emotions out of it and say, rather than being Lowell Schweigert in the past from the ’70s, what’s the best for the University of North Dakota and their athletic program? Based on what the N.C.A.A. had coming down the pike if we kept the name, it became pretty obvious that we had to make a change.”\nSchafer said he believed that change would be accepted over time.\n“There’s a strong element that thinks we ought to take that trademark, dig a big hole and bury it, never to be seen again,” Schafer said. “And there’s a strong element that says we should go back to that trademark and use it all over the place.\n“We have to celebrate our heritage. This was a part of U.N.D. for a long time, and it’s not going to go away. But if we handle it properly, we can say, O.K., this is our base, this is our heritage, this is what we stand for, and now we’re transitioning to the new. And in the future, that’s where we’re going to be.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/sports/hockey/with-sioux-nickname-gone-north-dakota-hockey-fans-are-fighting-change.html"}
