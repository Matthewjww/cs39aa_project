The next month, 1.6 tons were discovered in a container originating from Tanzania.\nLarge seizures also have been made in other countries recently, notably in Port Klang, Malaysia, last month.\nDemand from an increasingly affluent Asia and improved international trade and transport links have caused the trade in ivory and other wildlife products to soar in recent years, pushing many species to the brink. At the same time, enforcement and penalties remain weak in many countries, constituting little deterrent to smugglers and poachers, conservationists say.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/asia/seizures-of-illegal-ivory-are-rising-in-hong-kong.html"}
