Schwarzman, has secured an enormous investment from the Middle Eastern kingdom.\nThe company, Blackstone, which Mr. Schwarzman helped found, said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had committed $20 billion to a new investment fund aimed at infrastructure projects, primarily in the United States.\nThe commitment is about half of the capital Blackstone plans to raise for the fund. All told, including potential borrowed money, the new fund could invest more than $100 billion in infrastructure projects, the company said in its statement.\nThe fund was one of several business deals between an American company and Saudi Arabia announced after Mr. Trump’s arrival. At a ceremony in Riyadh on Saturday, General Electric said it had agreements for $15 billion worth of projects.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/business/dealbook/saudi-arabia-to-invest-20-billion-in-infrastructure-mostly-in-us.html"}
