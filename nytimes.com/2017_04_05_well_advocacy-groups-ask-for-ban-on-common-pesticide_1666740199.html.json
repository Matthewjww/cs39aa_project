Mr. Pruitt did not present any new evidence that it is safe, and said the agency could not be forced to complete a review of chlorpyrifos until 2022, when there is a deadline for re-evaluating it.\nThe E.P.A. had been under a court order to respond by the end of March to a 10-year-old petition to ban the chemical, originally filed in 2007 by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pesticide Action Network.\nThe most recent E.P.A. analysis concluded that children were being exposed to up to 140 times the safe levels of the pesticide through food alone. An earlier report said drinking water can also be contaminated.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/well/advocacy-groups-ask-for-ban-on-common-pesticide.html"}
