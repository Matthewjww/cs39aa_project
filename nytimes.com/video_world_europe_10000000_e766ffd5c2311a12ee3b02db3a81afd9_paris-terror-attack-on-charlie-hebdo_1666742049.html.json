That is why we have decided, with the Chief of Staff of the army, to mobilise 10,000 troops, who will be protecting vulnerable areas across the country from tomorrow evening. The mobilisation began this morning and will continue thanks to our forces’ very quick reaction and their professionalism, which will allow them to contribute to the security of our country.” “It is an internal operation in the true sense of the word. There are external operations being carried out, and it is an internal operation which will mobilise 10,000 troops, that is to say almost as many men as we have in our external operations.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000003444404/france-to-mobilize-10000-troops.html?playlistId=video/paris-terror-attack-on-charlie-hebdo"}
