The length of the book, and the amount of ground it covers, made the prospect of designing a cover for it “a little intimidating,” said Tyler Comrie, a senior designer at Knopf who was given the task.\n“There’s a part in the book where Glen stumbles on a puberty chart, when he was 14 or so,” Comrie said. “This presented a perfect opportunity: Three different stages of his life, all tied together with this thing he finds in the book and causes a lot of self-reflection. I was wishing he had dug this one a little bit more. In the end, I think there was too much humor. It made the book seem lighter than it is.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/books/cover-stories.html"}
