The move came as the companies said that a third shot of the vaccine sharply increased the levels of antibodies against the virus.\nThe companies conducted a study of 306 volunteers who received a booster shot about five to eight months after their second shot. Researchers found that the level of antibodies that block the coronavirus jumped more than three times higher than the level after the second dose.\nThe side effects of a third injection were about the same as after the initial two doses, the companies said. The underlying data was not included in the news release, nor were the dates or location of the study specified. The companies said they were preparing a scientific publication describing the research.\nThe news of Pfizer and BioNTechâ€™s booster application came two days after the F.D.A. fully approved their two-dose vaccine for those 16 and older, making it the first to move beyond emergency use status.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/politics/pfizer-vaccine-booster-trial-results.html"}
