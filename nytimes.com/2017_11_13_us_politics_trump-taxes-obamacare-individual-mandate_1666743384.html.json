Then he pressed them to change course.\n“Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further?” Mr. Trump said, referring to the health law’s mandate that most people have coverage or pay a penalty. “Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/us/politics/trump-taxes-obamacare-individual-mandate.html"}
