The Europeans say no, sticking to a pretty hard line.\nBut now, with 85 percent of a deal completed, and the toughest issues remaining, European officials say they are increasingly worried that Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is so divided and fragile that it could collapse, scuttling a deal and inflicting damage on the Continental economy.\nSo the Europeans are now exploring ways to finesse their position, three senior European officials say, to sign a withdrawal agreement by the end of the year so it can be ratified by the end of March, when Brexit occurs regardless.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/world/europe/uk-brexit-talks-eu.html"}
