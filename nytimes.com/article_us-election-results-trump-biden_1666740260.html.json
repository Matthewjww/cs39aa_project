It followed Georgia, where Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, signed off on Friday; a machine recount requested by the Trump campaign will begin this week, but Mr. Biden’s lead is much too large to expect a recount to overcome.\nMr. Trump’s campaign had tried to block the certification process in Michigan in the hopes of getting Republican state legislators to overrule millions of voters and appoint a pro-Trump slate to the Electoral College. The canvassing board’s vote on Monday torpedoed that effort. (Republicans could still sue, but such a lawsuit would be very unlikely to succeed.)\nMonday is also the deadline for counties in Pennsylvania to certify their totals and send them to Kathy Boockvar, the secretary of the commonwealth, who will certify the state results. Pennsylvania doesn’t have a hard deadline for when Ms. Boockvar must sign off, but she is likely to do so by Nov. 30.\nLast week, a court rejected a last-ditch effort by the Trump campaign to block certification in Pennsylvania. The campaign then filed an extremely narrow appeal that, even if accepted, would not delay the certification process, and that could be moot after certification. It is possible that, post-certification, the campaign could file a new lawsuit, but that, too, would be unlikely to succeed.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-election-results-trump-biden.html"}
