Trump on Friday sought to project support from African-Americans for his campaign on a single man in the audience.\nMr. Trump, at a rally here, began speaking about a previous rally in Arizona in which a black supporter was arrested after punching a protester.\n“We had a case where we had an African-American guy who is a fan of mine,” Mr. Trump said of an event in Arizona in March. “In fact I want to find out what’s going on with him.”\nAs his voice trailed off, Mr. Trump noticed a man in the crowd.\n“Oh look at my African-American over here,” Mr. Trump said. “Are you the greatest? Do you know what I’m talking about?”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/us/politics/donald-trump-african-americans.html"}
