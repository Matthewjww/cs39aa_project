Neffenger, the T.S.A. administrator, told members of the House Homeland Security Committee that the agency was promoting screeners from part time to full time, reassigning hundreds of behavioral detection officers to help on security lines and shifting bomb-detection dog teams to larger airports. Mr. Neffenger’s testimony comes just days before millions of Americans are expected to travel over the Memorial Day weekend. The agency has come under fire recently, with some passengers reporting hourslong waits to get through checkpoints.\nMany airlines say the delays have caused passengers to miss flights.\n“This is not a new rodeo,” said Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the committee. “Why didn’t we see this coming?”\nMr. Neffenger said the long lines were a product of higher-than-forecast passenger numbers, staffing shortages and changes in a program that allowed people who had not signed up for background checks to use expedited security lines. The agency tightened security procedures after federal auditors managed to get fake bombs and weapons past screeners, which has also contributed to the long lines.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/us/politics/airport-security-delays-wont-end-soon-tsa-chief-says.html"}
