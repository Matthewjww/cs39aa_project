Just 600,000 tenants have been helped by the program, passed as part of two coronavirus relief packages in 2020 and 2021.\nThe request caught Democratic leadership by surprise. An attempt to pass an extension by a voice vote this week is expected to fail in the Senate, according to several people close to the situation.\nThe expiration of the moratorium will almost certainly lead to an increase in evictions across the country, with estimates ranging from 300,000 to more than a million families in the first month after the freeze ends.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/politics/eviction-moratorium-biden-congress.html"}
