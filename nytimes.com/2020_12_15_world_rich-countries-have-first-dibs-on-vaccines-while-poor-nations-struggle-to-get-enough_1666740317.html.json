But some of the worldâ€™s richest countries have reserved enough doses to immunize their populations multiple times.\nWith no guarantee that any particular vaccine will come through, these countries have hedged their bets on a number of candidates. But if all the doses they have claimed are fulfilled, the European Union could inoculate its residents twice, Britain and the United States could do so four times over, and Canada six times over, according to a New York Times analysis of data collected by Duke University, Unicef and Airfinity, a science analytics company.\nThe United States has provided billions of dollars to back the research, development and manufacturing of five of the most promising vaccines against Covid-19, pushing them forward at a speed and scale that would otherwise have been impossible. But the support came with a condition: that Americans would get priority access to doses made in their country.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/world/rich-countries-have-first-dibs-on-vaccines-while-poor-nations-struggle-to-get-enough.html"}
