Booker began his term on July 1 in Newark vowing to reduce crime with a program of zero-tolerance policing.\nYesterday afternoon, the new mayor — along with two police officers in his security detail — had a firsthand opportunity to put that policy into effect.\nIn a city known for rampant crime and a murder rate that has been rising even as it has been generally falling nationwide, it is not unheard-of to see crimes take place in broad daylight.\nSometimes they even take place in front of City Hall.\nMayor Booker and his guards left Newark’s City Hall around 12:30 p.m. yesterday for a meeting and stumbled upon what appeared to be a confrontation across the street: a police officer and a man in a standoff on Broad Street. The officer held a gun and the man wielded a pair of scissors.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/14/nyregion/14booker.html"}
