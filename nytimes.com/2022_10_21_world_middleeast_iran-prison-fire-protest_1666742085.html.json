He was returning after a brief furlough.\nSwarms of anti-riot security forces, holding batons and guns, had taken position in the leafy area outside Evin Prison, a feared institution that has been a watchword for the torment and execution of those who have displeased the Islamic Republicâ€™s rulers.\nMr. Hashemi Rafsanjani, the son of a former president, was stunned when prison authorities told him to return home until further notice, according to family members. The authorities told him they could not guarantee his safety in the section where he was being kept, Ward 7.\nThe clashes that day in Ward 7, coming against a backdrop of nationwide antigovernment protests, started in the afternoon, became more intense at dusk and then spread to other wards.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/world/middleeast/iran-prison-fire-protest.html"}
