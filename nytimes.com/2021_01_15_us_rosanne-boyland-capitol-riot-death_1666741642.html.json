The videos show her body on the ground just outside a door on the Capitol’s west side that was the scene of some of the day’s worst violence.\nHer clothes and backpack strap in the videos match those she was seen wearing in a picture of her taken earlier that day, and two witnesses, one of whom tried to help her, gave similar accounts of her death.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/us/rosanne-boyland-capitol-riot-death.html"}
