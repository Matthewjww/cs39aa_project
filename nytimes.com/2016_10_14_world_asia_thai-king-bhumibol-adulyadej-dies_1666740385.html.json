He was 88 and one of the longest-reigning monarchs in history.\nThe royal palace said he died at Siriraj Hospital but gave no further details.\nKing Bhumibol was a unifying figure in a deeply polarized country, and his death cast a pall of uncertainty across Thailand, raising questions about the future of the monarchy itself.\nThe military junta, which seized power in a coup two years ago, derives its authority from the king. But the king’s heir apparent, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, seen by many as a jet-setting playboy, is not held in the same regard as his father.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/world/asia/thai-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-dies.html"}
