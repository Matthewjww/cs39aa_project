This is “The Daily.” Today —\narchived recording (barack obama) We have the most votes and the most diverse coalition of Americans that we’ve seen in a long, long time. [CHEERING]\nmichael barbaro\nThe Obama coalition has become almost mythic within the Democratic Party —\narchived recording (barack obama) There are young and old, rich and poor.\nmichael barbaro\n— for having united first-time voters, people of color —\narchived recording (barack obama) They are black and white — [CHEERING] — Latino and Asian and Native American.\nmichael barbaro\n— and moderates —\narchived recording (barack obama) They are Democrats from Des Moines, and independents from Concord, and, yes, some Republicans from rural Nevada.\nmichael barbaro\n— to win the presidency. This year —\narchived recording (bernie sanders) We ended up winning more votes from young people — [CHEERING] — black, and white, and Latino, and Asian-American, and Native American — more votes from young people than Trump and Clinton, combined. [CHEERING]\nmichael barbaro\n— Bernie Sanders is betting that he can win the presidency with young voters and people of color, but without the moderates. To do that —\narchived recording (bernie sanders) This campaign is listening to our brothers and sisters in the Latino community. [CHEERING]\nmichael barbaro\n— he’s counting on winning over and energizing the Latino vote. And the ultimate test of whether he will be able to do that is in California, where Latinos are the single biggest nonwhite voting block in the state.\narchived recording We’re not only going to win this nationally, we’re going to turn this state into a Bernie Sanders state so we can make the reforms we need.\nmichael barbaro\nYoung Latinos in California overwhelmingly support Sanders. But to become the Democratic nominee, he will need all Latinos.\narchived recording (alexandria ocasio-cortez) I call him Tío Bernie. Maybe to my goddaughter, he’s abuelo. Maybe to some others, he’s brother.\nmichael barbaro\nMy colleague Jennifer Medina went to California with “The Daily”‘s Jessica Cheung and Monika Evstatieva to see how that effort is playing out.\narchived recording (alexandria ocasio-cortez) But he’s my Tío Bernie Sanders.\nmichael barbaro\nIt’s Friday, January 17. O.K. So Jenny, tell me about this reporting trip. Where did you go?\njennifer medina\nSo back in December we went to South L.A. to a working-class neighborhood, mostly black and Latino, and we went to this quiet block.\n[dog barking]\njennifer medina\nLots of little small houses, very neatly kept —\njennifer medina It’s beautiful. monika evstatieva It smells like flowers.\njennifer medina\n— with flowers in their front yard and citrus trees.\nmonika evstatieva Quite a lot of lemons.\njennifer medina\nAnd it was a Saturday morning, people walking their dogs and hanging out. And the only noise, really, was the planes flying overhead to LAX.\nmichael barbaro\n[LAUGHS] And why were you there?\njennifer medina\nSo we were there for an event called Tamales for Tío Bernie.\nmichael barbaro\nTío as in uncle.\njennifer medina\nTío as in uncle, which is sort of the affectionate way a lot of young Latinos have begun referring to Bernie Sanders. And it just sort of speaks to the intimacy and affection these young Latinos have for Sanders. So there’s these little events all over California that are basically designed to get people who are already excited strategizing and figuring out how they can convince friends and family members and people they live around to be as excited as they are. What the Sanders campaign is really counting on is that these little events will have a ripple effect. So say you get 20 people to show up, but each of those people will convince five other people to vote for Sanders. And those people will convince another five people to vote for Sanders, and so on. So we get there, and we see people taping up signs to the fence, and sort of milling about. It’s just a handful of people who are here so far.\njennifer medina Hi. speaker Hola. Cómo estás?\njennifer medina\nThey’re setting up folding tables and chairs, and there’s a little, small blue tent. And there is a lot of food.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd are there tamales, as promised?\njennifer medina\nThere are indeed tamales. There are big bags of tamales, steaming tamales ready to be doled out to whoever comes.\nalfonso ruiz Alfonso. jessica cheung Alfonso, nice to meet you guys.\njennifer medina\nSo the organizer is Alfonso Ruiz, who is 28 and works in city government here in Los Angeles.\nalfonso ruiz Well, I live here, so this is my house. jessica cheung Oh! alfonso ruiz [LAUGHS] This is my house.\njennifer medina\nAnd Alfonso immediately seems a little bit nervous.\njennifer medina Have you ever hosted a campaign event before? alfonso ruiz Well, this technically is my first time. speaker Sorry, man. I did not know you were that famous, bro.\njennifer medina\nAs we’re talking, people start to show up. And everybody’s a little bit confused why we’re there with these big microphones, talking to their friends.\nspeaker You were anti-Bernie a few years ago! alfonso ruiz [LAUGHTER] Shut the [expletive] up! speaker I told you. I told you — alfonso ruiz He’s lying, he’s lying. speaker — since 2016, bro, he’s going to be president. alfonso ruiz I was supporting him since day one. Yeah. I believe in Bernie. I’ve been following. I was involved with him in 2015, in the primary. And now I’m here. jennifer medina Why did you get involved? You said you’ve been following him since 2015? alfonso ruiz 2005. jennifer medina 2005. alfonso ruiz When he was the first independent congressman. jennifer medina How old were you in 2005? alfonso ruiz I was, like, in high school. jennifer medina O.K. alfonso ruiz I was barely going into high school. But that’s the moment when you had the Iraq war, the Afghanistan war. I was tired of the Democratic —\nmichael barbaro\nSo Alfonso’s been drawn to Sanders since 2005.\njennifer medina\nYes. Alfonso really represents what I’ve heard from a lot of young Latinos here in L.A., which is that they were really first drawn to Sanders over his stance on the Iraq war.\njennifer medina So in 2005 you were — alfonso ruiz Against the Iraq war. jennifer medina — against the Iraq war. alfonso ruiz What I started noticing was there was no difference in between policymakers in terms of Democrats and Republicans, and they all blindly voted for this war that, at the end of the day, sent a lot of working-class kids to war, a lot of South Central kids, a lot of kids from Boyle Heights, a lot of kids from — that we have nothing else. If you live here, if you’ve been around here in the early 2000s and late ‘90s, all we saw was drive-bys, shootings, and people being killed. And when we see the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, there was basically no difference into what their policies were going on. So that’s why, at the end of day, I feel like Bernie’s talking above and beyond, because he showed it from day one in from what he did in Burlington to what he voted in Congress at the time.\njennifer medina\nSo it really represents what got many young Latinos first really excited about Sanders and explains what makes them so excited now.\nalfonso ruiz So for Bernie, he goes straight at the issue, the core, which at the end of the day is greed, corruption and lack of funding for our neighborhoods. And he knows that because he grew up in Brooklyn. And there’s a lot of similarities, like I said. And then I’ll mention this. Yeah, he’s a little güerito, but — jennifer medina Can you explain what you mean by a little güerito? alfonso ruiz He’s white. But still, he’s your tío. He knows what it is to grow up poor. He knows what it is, so that’s why I have faith.\nmichael barbaro\nThey identify with him.\njennifer medina\nThey really identify with him.\nmichael barbaro\nWhat exactly do you make of that?\njennifer medina\nThey identify with him in spite of the fact that he’s many decades older, that he’s from this East Coast state that many of them have never been to, and they identify with him because of his immigrant roots. His family immigrated, and he’s talked much more in recent times about his family coming from Europe to Brooklyn to escape persecution and anti-Semitism. And a lot of these young Latinos see in his immigration story their immigration story and feel really excited by that.\nmichael barbaro\nSo it’s resonating?\njennifer medina\nIt’s resonating, definitely, and it has really big consequences. It has had meaningful impact on the rest of the race where it’s drawing away from candidates you might expect Latinos to support.\njessica cheung I’m really compelled by the thing that you said which is what compels you about Bernie is the immigrant story. There’s another presidential candidate who also embodies the American dream —\njennifer medina\nSo at the time we spoke to Alfonso, there actually was a liberal Latino in the race.\njennifer medina — Julián Castro. And I wonder why Bernie over another American dream candidate? alfonso ruiz Ah.\njennifer medina\nAnd who identified as a Chicano, as a Latino.\nalfonso ruiz He does. He does. It’s hard because I think, like — yeah. jennifer medina Do you feel guilty about it? alfonso ruiz No, I don’t feel guilty. It’s just more like — well — jennifer medina I’m just sensing some guilt in your voice. alfonso ruiz Yeah. No. I think it’s like, ahh! I think it’s more like if I had seen him more as politically out there as Bernie in terms of the policy, really, really out there, I think I’ll be supporting him. But it’s just — in my mind, I’m considering him a little bit moderate.\nmichael barbaro\nHe’s saying Castro just didn’t speak to the things that I care about.\njennifer medina\nRight. Castro just wasn’t out there enough for me. Castro wasn’t loud enough, early enough for me, and Castro doesn’t represent the exact kind of policies — or didn’t represent the kind of policies I want to see strong enough and early enough. A lot of the Bernie Sanders young Latino supporters really like him because they see him as being passionate about the same things for decades and decades. There’s actually a sort of hobby, side hobby, of watching these old Sanders tapes from the 1970s and ‘80s.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd seeing how much they have not changed to now.\njennifer medina\nAnd seeing just how consistent and how his message is still the same 30, 40 years later.\njennifer medina Can you tell us just about — I mean, I know it’s called Tamales for Tío Bernie, but tell us about the event. Why did you decide to host this, and what are you hoping to do today? alfonso ruiz So for today I’m trying to get all my friends that are already involved, see how we can collaborate, how we could talk about more ways to get more people involved in the neighborhoods, specifically in these neighborhoods, because what I did notice in 2015 when he first ran, I had never seen any of my friends in this block talk about presidential candidate. But then people were talking. We were just sitting around, have drinks right here in the house, play beer pong, and then talk about it after. Like, hey, who are you supporting? But I was more surprised of how much his message stuck to people in my neighborhood.\njennifer medina\nThe strategy is just to have this sort of casual conversation, the same kind of conversation that was happening in 2015 that had nothing to do with the official campaign. He’s trying to replicate that now officially and bring a bunch of people together over food and talk about Sanders, and then take it up a notch and talk about how can they convince people who aren’t already into voting or into Senator Sanders specifically to do so?\nmichael barbaro\nAnd why is that the approach? What do we need to know about the Latino vote in California to understand the strategy?\njennifer medina\nSo Latinos are the biggest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc in California, and they really could swing the election if they show up to vote. But historically, Latinos have had a much lower turnout, and the Latino vote is quite young compared to average voters. So typically presidential campaigns — or any campaign, for that matter — have not necessarily catered to Latinos and certainly haven’t gone into neighborhoods like South L.A. So these people are really trying to figure out how they can convince people who are not super engaged, who might not even know that there is an election in March and who are just more preoccupied with things like working two jobs and getting food on the table and just don’t have time in their day-to-day lives to pay attention to politics.\nalfonso ruiz Oh, there’s my dad. Papá! jennifer medina [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nSo Alfonso’s dad, Maximo, comes home from his shift as a machinist. Maximo is 66 years old, and you could tell right away that he’s really proud of his son and really kind of happy that something’s happening in his driveway, but he’s also a little bit confused.\nmaximo ruiz [SPEAKING SPANISH]\nmichael barbaro\nRight. Again, the microphones.\njennifer medina\nThe microphones.\njennifer medina Who do you — do you have a favorite in the Democratic primary? maximo ruiz Biden. jennifer medina Biden. maximo ruiz Biden. jennifer medina Why? maximo ruiz Why? I think he’s doing better than Sanders, no, Bernie Sanders? jennifer medina Why do you think he’s better than Bernie Sanders? maximo ruiz I’m not sure.\nmichael barbaro\nSo Alfonso’s dad is not on the Sanders bandwagon.\njennifer medina\nDefinitely not. He feels pretty committed to Biden, and you can hear it’s just this sort of comfort level. It’s almost more emotional than anything else.\nmaximo ruiz Biden is the most — Biden is more on television. jennifer medina That’s what I thought. maximo ruiz And then it come from Obama, you know, vice president, very famous, better. jennifer medina And he hasn’t convinced you yet? maximo ruiz Who? jennifer medina Your son. maximo ruiz No. We haven’t talked about it much. jennifer medina You don’t? maximo ruiz No.\njennifer medina\nBiden is who he knows. That’s who he sees on TV, and he thinks of him as the vice president coming out of the Obama administration. And Maximo really represents what I hear a lot from older Latinos, which is they see that connection to the Obama administration as a really good thing. But among the younger set, they feel really disillusioned with the Obama administration.\nmichael barbaro\nWhy?\njennifer medina\nThey think of Obama as being deporter in chief, this nickname he earned because of the deportations that happened under his administration. So they see the Obama administration as something they want to move away from, not back to.\nalfonso ruiz And that’s what I’m saying. It’s hard to convince older people because they know him. Like, that’s it. Like, at the end of the day, voters just vote on people that they already know.\njennifer medina\nSo as we’ve been standing there talking, a small crowd has gathered. It’s about 15 people. Everybody’s gotten their food, their coffee, and taken their plates and sat down at this table. And —\nalfonso ruiz All right, hey, everybody.\njennifer medina\nAlfonso walks over and starts to kick it off.\nalfonso ruiz And we can go around and just say your name and why you support Bernie. jaime So my name is Jaime. I’ve been a Bernie supporter since his first run. mia My name is Mia, and I’ve been supporting Bernie since 2016. julian Hi, I’m Julian. The reason I support Bernie is because he’s by far the most genuine and trustworthy candidate out of anyone running. speaker 1 We take absolutely every opportunity we can to talk about Bernie, so even if that means talking to a group of men or of people at a taco stand. speaker 2 I don’t have any problem talking to anybody on the street, you know, to the person that sells tamales or the ones that are selling nopales to the homeless person. speaker 3 So wherever I’m at, if I’m in an Uber or I’m in [SPEAKING SPANISH] or wherever I’m at, I’m going to just turn around and start talking to someone about the presidential election. speaker 1 This is our community. We’re not showing up to a meeting. They totally did not expect it, and they said, who is Bernie Sanders? And so we’re like, that’s a great question. Let us tell you who he is. He’s amazing.\nmichael barbaro\nSo they’re basically comparing notes on how to pull off this strategy that you described.\njennifer medina\nRight, and they’re kind of talking about what works and sort of sharing victory stories. There’s a lot of pride in people talking about who they’ve managed to convince, including their own parents.\nspeaker My dad is all about self-responsibility, self-reliance, not relying on the government, not needing anything from anyone. They grew up in a different era, and they don’t believe that everyone should have, quote, unquote, “a handout.” And I tell him, that’s not someone giving you a handout. You have rights, and everyone should have equal access, and that’s what we’re fighting for. So this past April he became a citizen, and he’s going to vote for the first time in his whole life. He’s going to vote for Bernie Sanders. His first vote is going to Bernie Sanders. And that is so powerful.\nmichael barbaro\nI’m curious if Alfonso’s dad, a Biden supporter, is hearing all this, since this is happening in his own driveway.\njennifer medina\nAlfonso’s dad has kind of been standing there the whole time but playing host. He’s making sure everybody has enough food and that everybody’s comfortable and really standing there and taking it all in. He’s had this kind of shy smile on his face the whole time and clearly listening to everything. But as things start to wrap up, one woman turns to him and says —\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nWell, what about you? Are you going to support Sanders?\nmaximo ruiz [SPEAKING SPANISH] speaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nHe sort of tries to brush her off and change the subject, and Alfonso kind of chimes in and says —\nalfonso ruiz [SPEAKING SPANISH] [LAUGHTER]\njennifer medina\nNo, no, not my dad. He’s not convincable.\nmichael barbaro\nSo even the son admits that, in this case, his dad is a little bit of a lost cause when it comes to Bernie.\njennifer medina\nThat’s right.\nmaximo ruiz [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nAnd it’s really indicative of the challenge that is facing Alfonso and all these supporters. Maximo told me with a great deal of pride that he has voted in every election since he became a citizen in 1986. So here’s somebody who votes all the time and is going to be casting a vote but won’t be for Sanders. They can’t convince somebody who is a prime voter.\nspeaker 1 [SPEAKING SPANISH] monika evstatieva Nice to meet you.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd if Bernie doesn’t win California?\njennifer medina\nAnd if he doesn’t win California and if he doesn’t win Latinos in California, it’s really a bad sign for the campaign, because they’ve put so much effort into it and really made clear that this is the way they think they can win.\nmichael barbaro\nSo the question is if young Latino voters can’t convince someone like Maximo to vote for Sanders, can this strategy actually work?\njennifer medina\nExactly.\nmichael barbaro\nWe’ll be right back. O.K., Jenny, where did you go next?\njennifer medina I don’t know that this matters —\njennifer medina\nSo we drive about an hour deep into the San Fernando Valley.\ngps navigation Turn left onto San Marino Street.\njennifer medina\nThis is a part of L.A. that is much more rural than what you typically think of. People here have ranches and horses and trailers.\njennifer medina There’s a car in the driveway. jessica cheung And an R.V. jennifer medina And an R.V. Well, these are people who have horses, so they need those. jessica cheung Oh, yeah.\njennifer medina\nAnd this part of Los Angeles has a much more conservative and libertarian streak. We also know that many of the voters here would be first-time voters, so people who haven’t shown up at the polls before. But again, the Sanders campaign needs all Latinos in order to win, so they are here to convince these people too. And this event is targeting charros.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd what are charros?\njennifer medina\nCharros are Mexican cowboys. There’s a big community of them in this part of L.A.\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nSo we get to this house, and we go up to the door. And as soon as we get to the backyard, we see all these guys standing there in snakeskin boots and big belt buckles and big cowboy hats. And it feels just like a party. People are all sitting around this pool. Again, there’s lots of food here. It’s very casual.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd who’s hosting this event?\njoseline garcia Hi, Joseline. jennifer medina Jenny. joseline garcia Nice to meet you.\njennifer medina\nSo this event is being hosted by Joseline Garcia, who is a staffer on the Sanders campaign here in L.A. She’s in charge of college outreach, but she’s decided to do this event because of people her father knows. Her father is a charro, and she got him to invite many of his friends. And once again the Sanders campaign is really using younger voters to reach out to older voters and try to get them into the fold.\njoseline garcia [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nSo Joseline starts the event and gathers everybody, and there’s also —\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\n— Rafael Návar, who is the state director for the Sanders campaign in California.\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\nmichael barbaro\nSo the head of the entire Sanders campaign in California is at this little house gathering. What do you make of that?\njennifer medina\nIt just goes to show how important all of these small events are to the campaign, that you have the state director with a couple of dozen people here to make the pitch himself.\nrafael návar And this campaign has prioritized people that look like this country and let folks in, not just Latinos, but other people of color. The diversity and beauty —\njennifer medina\nSo Joseline and Rafael open it up —\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\n— and go through the Sanders platform. Many people here are hearing about this all for the first time, and it’s a lot to take in. They go through —\njoseline garcia [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\n— “Medicare for all” —\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\n— tuition-free college.\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nAnd they speak for several minutes.\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nThe charros are standing there with their arms folded, sort of nodding, but —\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\n— as they close and open it up for questions, the questions start coming really quickly.\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nHow is the Sanders campaign going to help their small businesses?\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nWhat will they do about the potheads they see on the streets?\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nAnd they ask a lot about taxes.\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nAnd what they really want to know is, how are you going to get the money for this? Am I going to have to be paying more in taxes?\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nAnd the Sanders campaign replies to them —\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\n— by talking about the Green New Deal, arguing that that will help small businesses.\njoseline garcia [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nThey talk about how Medicare for all would mean that employers don’t have to pay for employees’ health insurance.\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nAnd say, look, the people who are going to be taxed are the millionaires and billionaires, not you.\nrafael návar [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nBut it’s becoming really clear, though the charros are nodding their head and being really polite, that these answers aren’t really convincing them. Ultimately, these are progressive answers for conservatives.\njoseline garcia [SPEAKING SPANISH]\nmichael barbaro\nJenny, I guess, listening to all this, I’m trying to figure out if this strategy makes sense to you as a political reporter. The first event I understand. Young Latino voters who are passionate about Sanders want to help spread the word and maybe convince older Latinos why this guy is in their best interest. But this event feels different. These are voters who need to be convinced of so many things, right? They need to be convinced to care about politics. They need to be convinced that a progressive candidate is somehow in line with their more conservative values, and they need to be so convinced that they go out and vote on Election Day, maybe for the first time.\njennifer medina\nI definitely agree and totally hear the skepticism, and there’s real reason to be skeptical. There’s no question that the strategy absolutely relies on getting new voters and convincing people who have never voted before and who don’t see politics as part of their everyday lives to show up and vote in the primary for Bernie Sanders.\njoseline garcia [SPEAKING SPANISH] [APPLAUSE]\n[music]\njennifer medina\nSo when the event wraps, I make a really quick beeline to this group of charros and focus on one who had asked the most questions.\njennifer medina [SPEAKING SPANISH]\njennifer medina\nHis name is Victor Trinidad, and he’s dressed in all black wearing cowboy boots and a big belt buckle.\njessica cheung And you’re wearing a cowboy hat. victor trinidad That’s right. jennifer medina Do you consider yourself a charro? victor trinidad No. I have a horse. jennifer medina So? [LAUGHTER] victor trinidad Well, I don’t know if that’s being a charro — cowboy. jennifer medina A cowboy as opposed to a charro?\njennifer medina\nAnd it becomes pretty clear immediately that he is somebody with a fierce independent streak.\njennifer medina What are the most important issues? You asked about small business, right? victor trinidad Yes. jennifer medina So what are the most — do you own a small business? victor trinidad I do. jennifer medina What kind of business do you own? victor trinidad Landscape. jennifer medina So the most important issue for you is how to grow your small business? victor trinidad What do they offer, yes, for small businesses? jennifer medina What did you think of the answer you heard tonight? Did you feel like there was an answer to your question? victor trinidad Not what I wanted to hear, just because it’s kind of a short answer. I think it has to be more detailed and it’s more to it. jennifer medina And so do you know who you’re going to vote for? victor trinidad Not really, and I’m just going to follow and see who is going to get my vote. Maybe it’s him. I don’t know.\njennifer medina\nSo he’s telling me, maybe I’ll vote for Sanders —\nvictor trinidad But I’m definitely going to vote for sure, yeah.\njennifer medina\n— but I’m definitely going to vote.\njennifer medina So why are you voting this time? victor trinidad Well, for the first time, I’m going to vote just because I experience a lot of racism that I wasn’t used to prior to Trump in office. So that kind of just motivated me to just to vote against this behavior.\njennifer medina\nAnd this is something we see a lot in the Latino community right now, which is much more enthusiasm about voting because of Trump and because of what people are experiencing.\njennifer medina What’s happening now that you didn’t feel like happened before Trump? victor trinidad Just dirty looks, saying bad things that I don’t want to say. That’s about it. jennifer medina Are you registered as a Democrat? victor trinidad No. jennifer medina What are you registered as? victor trinidad Independent. jennifer medina So you have to request a ballot to vote as a Democrat. Did you know that? victor trinidad I think I get ballots from the mail, but I choose — jennifer medina Right. victor trinidad Oh, I have to be registered? jennifer medina To vote in the primary — this is a confusing California thing — to vote in the primary, you have to request a ballot if you’re not registered as a Democrat. victor trinidad That’s crazy. I don’t think I’ll do that. jennifer medina You don’t think you’ll do that? victor trinidad I’m not going to register just — unless something truly motivates me. jennifer medina And you didn’t hear anything tonight that really motivates you? victor trinidad Going to have to hear from the other guys.\nmichael barbaro\nJenny, this does not seem like a good sign.\njennifer medina\nIt does not seem like a good sign. And it goes to show that while a lot of Latinos are very eager to vote against Trump, it’s much more difficult to get them to show up in a primary and vote for somebody else, and it’s not an easy process.\njennifer medina Hi. How are you? I’m Jenny Medina. I’m a reporter with The New York Times. miriam cuesta Jenny? I’m Miriam. Hi. jennifer medina And you’re Jenny also? jennifer najera Jenny, yes. Nice to meet you.\njennifer medina\nSo we speak to two young women, Miriam Cuesta and Jennifer Najera, who are both college students, and both are die-hard Bernie supporters.\njennifer medina Do you use the term “Tío Bernie“? miriam cuesta Oh, Tío Bernie? jennifer najera Tío Bernie? miriam cuesta Yeah. jennifer najera Tío Bernie. Tío Bernie, yeah. miriam cuesta There’s always someone in our family, a tío, an uncle, who you just get along with. You know. You understand them. You know, they might be different than you. So Bernie, he’s seen a lot as just an old white man, but he still comes from an immigrant family. And so we understand each other. Even if our battles were different, he’s our tío. We get it. He understands us even though he doesn’t have to necessarily live us.\njennifer medina\nAnd they both brought both of their parents tonight.\nmiriam cuesta Yes, I brought my mom and my dad. jennifer medina Where? Where are they? miriam cuesta Over there. jennifer medina Oh, with the leather jacket.\njennifer medina\nBut as we’re talking —\njennifer medina Is she a registered voter? miriam cuesta No. Neither of my parents are.\njennifer medina\n— it becomes clear that her parents won’t vote.\njennifer medina Are they ever eligible to vote? miriam cuesta No. jennifer medina O.K. miriam cuesta So that’s another perspective that I feel like — I think the majority of the people here are eligible voters, and we are not.\njennifer medina\nAnd, in fact —\nmiriam cuesta So all three of us are not. So it’s — jennifer medina You’re not an eligible voter? miriam cuesta No, I am not.\njennifer medina\nMiriam herself cannot vote.\njennifer medina So what are you doing? If you can’t vote, what do you do with your energy and your activism? miriam cuesta Exactly, yeah. I think that’s one of the reasons why I am so active, because I can’t vote. I can’t even legally donate money to any campaign, and so all I have left is to put in the time and energy. So I started a club on my campus. I started knocking on doors. We started making calls. We started asking just strangers on our campus, do you support Bernie? If you do, make sure you’re registered. By this day, you’re going to vote. If you’re not, let me answer some questions. Let me educate you just in general, just plant a seed. That’s how I can contribute to him. If I can’t vote, at least I can get another person to vote for him in my place.\njennifer medina\nAnd then as I talked to Jennifer —\njennifer medina Are you eligible to vote? jennifer najera Yes, I’m eligible to vote.\njennifer medina\nshe can vote.\njennifer medina Are your parents eligible to vote? jennifer najera They’re not eligible.\njennifer medina\nBut her parents cannot.\njennifer najera So just coming here tonight, I wanted to humanize it for them, let them know that politics isn’t just evil and corruption. It’s community, community building, bonding with people, hope, all of these things that we hope to spread with the campaign about Bernie.\njennifer medina\nAnd so this just stuns me, that, of half a dozen people I’m speaking to at this event of maybe 20 people, five of them — five out of six of them cannot vote.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd why can’t they vote?\njennifer medina\nThey can’t vote because they’re not U.S. citizens.\nspeaker [SPEAKING SPANISH]\nmichael barbaro\nJenny, what do you take away from these two events that you went to in Los Angeles? What should we take away from these two events that you went to?\njennifer medina\nIt goes to show how complicated the Latino vote is not just in California but in the United States, which is — it’s young. It is mixed status. There are people who are citizens and people who are not. There are English speakers and Spanish speakers. It’s a huge, varied group, and it requires a lot of outreach to get the kind of enthusiasm to show up at the polls and make a difference. But if you multiply these two events by a thousand, you can imagine this movement spreading throughout California and really tipping the scales to the Sanders campaign. So what they’re really trying to do is create this brand-new coalition that brings in all sorts of new Latino voters, both young and old. And if it works, it will probably seem almost obvious in retrospect. But what these two events show us is just how challenging and labor intensive the work is.\nmichael barbaro\nWhich is why the question of the Obama coalition without the moderates is being tested in the Sanders campaign.\njennifer medina\nRight. If this works, it could revolutionize the way Latino voters are thought of. If it doesn’t, then the Sanders campaign loses.\nmichael barbaro\nJenny, thank you very much.\njennifer medina\nThank you.\nmichael barbaro\nWe’ll be right back.\narchived recording (john roberts) At this time, I will administer the oath to all senators in the chamber in conformance with Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 of the Constitution and the Senate’s impeachment rules.\nmichael barbaro\nHere’s what else you need to know today.\narchived recording (john roberts) Will all senators now stand or remain standing and raise their right hand?\nmichael barbaro\nOn Thursday, the Senate formally opened the impeachment trial of President Trump as Chief Justice John Roberts swore in the body’s 100 members as jurors.\narchived recording (john roberts) Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God? archived recording I do.\nmichael barbaro\nMoments later, the sergeant-at-arms announced the rules for the trial.\narchived recording Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. All persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump, president of the United States.\nmichael barbaro\nWith that, the Senate paused the trial until the beginning of next week.\narchived recording (john roberts) The Senate, sitting as court of impeachment, is adjourned until Tuesday, January 21 at 1:00 p.m. [GAVEL]\nmichael barbaro", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren.html"}
