China has already been imposing some of the strictest quarantine and lockdown measures in the world.\nOver the weekend, before the Omicron cases were discovered, China had already stepped up containment efforts in port cities, partly in response to recent outbreaks that have been tracked back to imported cases of the coronavirus. The new efforts include increased testing for those traveling to or working in those cities.\nChina announced details of the second Omicron case on Tuesday. The patient, a 67-year-old man, had repeatedly tested negative during his first 14 days of quarantine in an arrival facility. He then traveled to the southeastern city of Guangzhou for an additional seven days of home isolation, and only then was he found to have the variant. He showed no serious symptoms.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/world/a-second-omicron-case-in-china-raises-the-prospect-of-stricter-controls.html"}
