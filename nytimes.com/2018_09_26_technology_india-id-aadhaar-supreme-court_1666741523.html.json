That was at least a temporary blow to the dreams of technology billionaires, like Nandan Nilekani and Vinod Khosla, who saw the system as crucial to a new generation of digital businesses like online vehicle insurance and pre-employment background checks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/india-id-aadhaar-supreme-court.html"}
