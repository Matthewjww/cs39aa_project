The hospitalizations of young children now are “blowing away our previous Delta wave at the end of the summer, early fall, which had been our highest prior to that,” said Dr. Danielle Zerr, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Seattle Children’s Hospital.\nExperts are typically cautious about interpreting an increase in pediatric hospitalizations as a sign that a variant is particularly severe in children relative to adults. There were similar fears about the Delta and Beta variants, but the rise in pediatric hospitalizations then turned out to be more a consequence of the contagiousness of the variants.\nThis time, too, at least part of the increase in cases is a reflection of Omicron’s surge across all age groups. The nation is now recording roughly 600,000 cases on average per day, about one in five of them in children.\n“The more kids that get infected, the more you’re going to have kids who are going to be sick enough to be hospitalized,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics and a physician at Stanford University.\nAt Seattle Children’s Hospital, for example, about 21 percent of children are testing positive for the coronavirus, compared with the average of about 1 percent and a high during the Delta wave of about 3 percent.\n“That is just a game changer,” Dr. Zerr said of the more recent figures.\nDoctors may be quicker to admit a young child than an adult with similar symptoms, and that may account for some of the rising rates in young children. But some experts said the increase this time might be too steep to be explained only by the usual factors.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/health/covid-children-hospitals.html"}
