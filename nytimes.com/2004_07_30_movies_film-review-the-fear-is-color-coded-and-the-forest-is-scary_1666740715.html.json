Night Shyamalan remains our leading cinematic rug-puller, but the carpet grows ever more threadbare. This time, he populates a pre-industrial Pennsylvanian village with an impressive cast of elders and youngsters, who almost never use contractions and who live in fear of some scary creatures in the surrounding woods. As ever, Mr. Shyamalan uses the classic techniques of movie suspense (and James Newton Howard's sinister score) to conjure an atmosphere of mystery and dread, which vanishes even before the big plot twist sends the picture spinning into silly, pretentious allegory. Don't worry, I won't spoil the surprise. It spoils itself. â€” A. O.

Their village, which appears not to have a name, is somewhere in the preindustrial wilds of Pennsylvania. It is cut off from the rest of the world (referred to as ''the towns'') by forests inhabited by monstrous, mysterious creatures.\nAn elaborate set of rules and customs has been devised to keep the beasts at bay: there are watchtowers, warning bells and amber flags and robes, and anything red (''the bad color'') must be buried. (These colors may, in the film's allegorical scheme, be intended to evoke the government's color-coded terror alerts.) Domestic animals are sometimes found killed and partly skinned, and now and again the monsters emerge from the shadows to frighten and warn the villagers. They are propitiated with fresh meat and earnest meetings of the village elders, a distinguished group that includes William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson and Cherry Jones.\nOtherwise, life goes on in its normal, old-fashioned storybook way. There are barn dances, weddings and big outdoor meals at tables laden with lovely victuals, all of it filmed in grayish reproduction-antique light by the incomparable Roger Deakins. People speak in a stately, wordy idiom, disdaining contractions and using the subjunctive with breathtaking precision. Mr. Hurt was born to talk this way -- he talks this way in all his movies -- which is no doubt why he was elected (or appointed, or whatever) village elder in chief (or school headmaster, or something). The younger folk have a tougher time of it, in particular Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays Mr. Hurt's blind younger daughter, Ivy.\nMs. Howard, making her movie debut, has enough charm to make her way through some of the script's sillier lines. ''Do you find me too much of a tomboy?'' she asks the moody Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). ''I do long to do boy things.'' As, no doubt, does he. So, for that matter, does the village idiot, Noah, played with good-natured hamminess by Adrien Brody. Indeed, the whole village seems to be possessed by barely suppressed yearnings and guilty secrets. These, more than the beasts in the woods, might have been the subject of an interesting, Hardyesque inquiry into small-town life, but Mr. Shyamalan once again uses the psychology of his characters as the ultimate red herring, fooling us into caring more about the people in the movie than he does.\nHe does, at least, care about the way his movies look, and his disdain for newfangled special effects is refreshing. His mastery of classic suspense-movie framing and cutting is as impressive as ever, and the sound design, which layers James Newton Howard's spooky score with the equally sinister sounds of the forest, is impressive, especially when it evokes Ivy's blindness. At times you do sit up in your chair and crane your neck, as if you could see around the next bend of the story and glimpse what's coming. Then you do see it, and you burst out laughing.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/movies/film-review-the-fear-is-color-coded-and-the-forest-is-scary.html"}
