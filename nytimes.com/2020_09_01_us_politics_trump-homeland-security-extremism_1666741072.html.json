Wolf, appear to be doing the opposite of what had been promised. Far from cooperating with local governments and citizens to combat domestic unrest, particularly from the far right, they have joined President Trump in lashing out at American mayors and governors while deploying federal tactical teams to cities — often expressly against the wishes of the local governments with which they had pledged to cooperate.\nOn Monday night on Fox News, Mr. Wolf said he spoke with Attorney General William P. Barr about arresting leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/us/politics/trump-homeland-security-extremism.html"}
