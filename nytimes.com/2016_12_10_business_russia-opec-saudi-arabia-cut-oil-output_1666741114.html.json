The oil-producing nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cuts of 558,000 barrels per day, according to a statement after the meeting.\nWhile the deal is eye-catching, it follows months of unrestrained production increases. Analysts said it could be difficult to precisely monitor just how much oil producers are pumping, and that countries like Russia have rarely shown a willingness to cut production or to cooperate with others. “It may all come to seem an optical illusion,” said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm.\nThe cuts, if carried out, will amount to only around 2 percent of the overall global oil market. But they are likely to be perceived as significant by oil traders because the world’s two largest exporters, Saudi Arabia and Russia, are involved.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/business/russia-opec-saudi-arabia-cut-oil-output.html"}
