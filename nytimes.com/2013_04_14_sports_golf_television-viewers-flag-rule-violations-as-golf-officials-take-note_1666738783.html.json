This collaboration of living room second-guessers and rules officials is an almost weekly occurrence. On Saturday, it embroiled the Masters, golf’s biggest event, in a controversy that involved the game’s most celebrated player, Tiger Woods.\nWoods, who had been three strokes off the lead, was assessed a two-stroke penalty Saturday for hitting from the wrong spot on Friday, a violation first flagged by a television viewer. Woods could have been disqualified from the Masters, but officials instead invoked a rarely applied two-year-old rule that spares offending players in exceptional cases.\nThe catalyst for the rules controversy began with a short and simple text message.\nA friend of a rules official saw something on television that looked improper, an illegal drop by Woods after his ball plunked into a pond at the 15th hole.\nMasters officials would not reveal the identity of the texter, but the claim was brought before the Masters rules committee, which decided there was no violation. Then, about an hour later, Woods inadvertently implicated himself, saying that before dropping the ball he had taken two steps back, which was not permitted under the circumstances.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sports/golf/television-viewers-flag-rule-violations-as-golf-officials-take-note.html"}
