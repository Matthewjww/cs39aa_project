What are your views on the detention of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba? Do you have feelings about Islam or Muslims that you believe would make it hard for you to render a fair verdict? Are you afraid of dying in a terrorist attack?\nThose and other questions were posed this week to the more than 1,000 people who were called to Federal District Court in Manhattan to be screened as possible jurors in the city’s latest terrorism-related trial.\nThe defendant, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, is the first Guantánamo detainee to be moved into the civilian court system for trial. Mr. Ghailani is charged with conspiring in the 1998 bombings of two United States Embassies in East Africa. The attacks, carried out by Al Qaeda, killed 224 people.\nMr. Ghailani’s lawyers requested a questionnaire, a strategy not uncommon in high-profile cases as a supplement to the oral questioning of jurors known as voir dire.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/nyregion/25ghailani.html"}
