Trump voted him into office because of his vows to shake up Washington and implement sweeping changes. He has acted on several of those campaign promises since taking office on Jan. 20.\nChief among them was an executive order sharply curtailing the entry of refugees and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, earning praise from a large portion of the electorate that voted for him.\nWe’d like to hear from President Trump’s supporters about what they think of his policies as they are enacted. Is he beginning to fulfill the promises that propelled you to vote for him? Or is he going in a direction different than what you had hoped?\nTimes reporters covering his presidency may contact you to learn more about you and your story.
