This, I imagine, Graves would recognize as an ancient, archetypal attribute relating her to the moon. So, perhaps she personifies not only earthy, untrammeled bodily energy, but also what you might call lunar consciousness: a kind of intuitive mentality that in many old, esoteric traditions represents the opposite of “solar” rationality. In Mr. Dunham’s dream world, the sun shines cheerfully in blue skies, suggesting a poetic reconciliation of usually opposed states of mind.\nThe paintings, which call to mind Henri Rousseau, Picasso and R. Crumb, look as if they were made in fevers of inspiration, as if the artist were possessed by the spirit of his own inner wild woman. Yet his compositions have a blocky solidity in contrast to the activities they represent. One canvas depicts a tree whipped by violent wind, which is manifested in a seemingly spontaneous flurry of black brush strokes scumbled over the topmost leaves. Maybe it is an allegory of the artist holding fast to his roots in the earth of painting itself while bending to gusts of visionary imagination.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/arts/design/carroll-dunham.html"}
