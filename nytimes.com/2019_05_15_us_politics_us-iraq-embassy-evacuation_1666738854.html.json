The order applies primarily to full-time diplomats posted to Iraq by State Department headquarters in Washington, and an embassy statement said that visa services in Iraq would be suspended as a result. Contractors who provide security, food and other such services will remain in place for now.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that the administration had received intelligence related to “Iranian activity” that put American facilities and service personnel at “substantial risk.” Other American officials have said the same piece of intelligence points to potential attacks by Shiite Arab militias tied to Iran against American troops in Iraq or Syria.\nThe State Department already had been discussing big cuts to the ranks of employees in the Baghdad and Kabul embassies as part of trying to wind down American involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, American officials said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/us-iraq-embassy-evacuation.html"}
