Men and women cheered and waved flags bearing the alliance’s slogan, “The Will of the People.”\n“We will have before us great challenges. We will fight racism, we will fight fascism; we will defend our rights, regardless of the government,” he said. “Today, we are stronger.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/world/middleeast/voters-in-nazareth-cheer-gains-by-arab-alliance.html"}
