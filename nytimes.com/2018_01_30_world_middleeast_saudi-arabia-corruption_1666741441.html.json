Many were brought in as witnesses, while others were accused of corruption and released only after handing over significant assets to the government, the statement said.\nThe release of many of the detainees appeared to signal the wrapping up of the two-and-a-half-month campaign, in which some of the kingdom’s richest and most powerful men were locked in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where the authorities pressed them to hand over assets said to have been stolen from the state.\nThe detainees included businessmen, current and former government ministers, and at least 11 princes, including Alwaleed bin Talal, the kingdom’s most famous investor, who was released on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-corruption.html"}
