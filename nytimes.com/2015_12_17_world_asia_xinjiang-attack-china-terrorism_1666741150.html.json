Then images of Chinese police officers roaming the rugged Tianshan mountains near the border with Kazakhstan in an extensive manhunt in October and November were shown in the state news media, which claimed that 28 people suspected of taking part in the attack had been killed.\nThe Chinese government has called the attack at the Sogan coal mine, in remote Baicheng County, an act of terrorism. It has also sought to portray its continuing campaign to quell unrest among Xinjiang’s Uighur minority as part of a global effort to combat violent religious extremism.\nBut the government has been selective in disclosing the extent of the violence in the region for fear, some analysts and officials say, of frightening the millions of ethnic Han Chinese who live in Xinjiang, after decades of government-supported migration. Uighurs, a mostly Muslim Turkic group, were once an overwhelming majority in the region, but they now make up about 40 percent of Xinjiang’s 22 million people.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/world/asia/xinjiang-attack-china-terrorism.html"}
