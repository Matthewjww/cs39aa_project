The gain of 20 million insured, based on an Obama administration estimate last year, is probably now even higher.\nNot everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an “individual mandate” to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.\nThe rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform. In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldn’t get health care. Now, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C.B.O. analysis disagreed.\nIt has made many Americans more financially secure.\nHealth insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured. It is still early to measure the health law’s full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks. Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined.\nIt has reduced inequality.\nIn an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law. Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners. This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administration’s goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans.\nIt made health insurance more comprehensive.\nBefore Obamacare, many products could be called “health insurance.” Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they can’t cap how much they will pay in a given year. Many of the law’s critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patients’ access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings.\nIt lowered the federal deficit.\nObamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost. A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025. (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the law’s tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/upshot/grading-obamacare-successes-failures-and-incompletes.html"}
