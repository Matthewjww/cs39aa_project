Bush, and appears to be a concession by the United States that finding safer variants of the weapons has so far failed.\nMost American cluster munitions held abroad appear to be positioned for a possible war with North Korea. Under a 2008 agreement, the Pentagon maintains a stockpile of more than 1.5 million cluster munitions, containing over 90 million bomblets, in South Korea.\nCluster munitions include a wide variety of rockets, bombs, missiles and artillery projectiles that scatter smaller weapons, called submunitions, over a target area. Some dispensers can release as many as several hundred bomblets.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/cluster-munitions-pentagon-south-korea.html"}
