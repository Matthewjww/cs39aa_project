Pym. The house was destroyed and the pilot was killed.\nJudge Pym, then a lawyer in the United States attorney’s office in Riverside, Calif., was unharmed, as were her husband and children. She was later matter-of-fact in recounting the tale.\n“A plane crashed into my house. Not good,” she told Stephen G. Larson, who was then a judge in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.\n“Someone else might get overly excited, but Sheri was incredibly steady,” said Mr. Larson, now a local lawyer. “She stays calm under pressure.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/technology/judge-in-apple-case-seen-as-unfazed-by-stress-even-a-plane-crash.html"}
