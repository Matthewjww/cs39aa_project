He helped subdue the attacker, according to video of the incident, and was conscious when he was taken to a hospital.\nSeveral political figures have been assaulted in recent weeks in Hong Kong, including three pro-democracy candidates for upcoming district council elections. On Sunday, Andrew Chiu, a pro-democracy district council member, had part of his ear bitten off when he tried to restrain a man, apparently an opponent of the protests, who stabbed two people outside a shopping mall.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/world/asia/junius-ho-stabbed-hong-kong.html"}
