Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda, who was Mexico’s defense minister from 2012 to 2018, was arrested by American officials at the request of the Drug Enforcement Administration and will face drug and money-laundering charges in the United States, according to a federal law enforcement official in New York.\nThe news not only casts a pall over Mexico’s fight against organized crime, but also underscores the forces of corruption that touch the highest levels of the government. General Cienfuegos was defense minister throughout the administration of President Enrique Peña Nieto, who left office two years ago.\nThe damage to Mexico is hard to overstate. General Cienfuegos’s arrest comes only 10 months after another top Mexican official — who once led the Mexican equivalent of the F.B.I. — was indicted in New York on charges of taking bribes while in office to protect the Sinaloa drug cartel, one of Mexico’s most powerful criminal mafias.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/us/mexico-general-cienfuegos-dea.html"}
