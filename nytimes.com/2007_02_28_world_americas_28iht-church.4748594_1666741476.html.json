A Chapter 11 filing automatically halts court proceedings.\nSan Diego is the fifth U.S. diocese to file for bankruptcy protection under the shadow of sex abuse claims. With nearly one million parishioners, it is also the largest to do so.\nIn a letter posted on the diocese's Web site earlier in the day, Bishop Robert Brom wrote that the diocese had \"decided against litigating our cases because of the length of time the process could take and, more importantly, because early trial judgments in favor of some victims could so deplete diocesan and insurance resources that there would be nothing left for other victims.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/28/world/americas/28iht-church.4748594.html"}
