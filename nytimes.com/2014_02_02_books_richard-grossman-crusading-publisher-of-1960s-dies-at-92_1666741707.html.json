He had been moved by an article on the subject in The New Republic.\nAt the same time, a young lawyer named Ralph Nader, who had been studying car safety for several years, wanted to write a book in which he would contend that automakers had long put profits ahead of safety. One publisher, in rebuffing him, told him that such a book would interest only insurance adjusters.\nThe journalist James Ridgeway, who had written the magazine article and who had used Mr. Nader as his principal source, brought Mr. Grossman and Mr. Nader together. They signed a contract that gave Mr. Nader a $3,000 advance.\nThe deal resulted in “Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-in Dangers of the American Automobile,” published in 1965, which helped jump-start the modern consumer movement, much as Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” ignited environmentalism in 1962.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/books/richard-grossman-crusading-publisher-of-1960s-dies-at-92.html"}
