The friend, who has not been publicly identified, told Reuters that he thought nothing of the text initially, but now wonders if it was a hint of Thursday’s attacks.\nAs the attacks claimed another victim on Saturday, states around the nation sought to bolster security for local military recruiters by pulling them into safer locales or authorizing them to be armed.\nPetty Officer Second Class Randall Smith, a 26-year-old logistics specialist from Ohio who had only recently re-enlisted in the Navy, died just after 2 a.m. Saturday from his wounds, becoming the fifth service member killed in the shootings at a military reserve center and a nearby recruiting center.\nFour Marines died in the slaughter on Thursday. Mr. Abdulazeez, 24, who was a naturalized American citizen born in Kuwait, was fatally shot in a face-off with the police. Petty Officer Smith, who was married and the father of three young daughters, was shot three times, suffering wounds to the liver and colon.\nDarlene Proxmire, his step-grandmother, said on Saturday that despite the severity of the sailor’s condition he had been able to give his wife the thumbs-up sign hours after the attack.\n“He loved the Navy, his wife and three little girls,” she said.\nTwo other people, a Marine and a Chattanooga police officer, remained hospitalized on Saturday with wounds that were described as not life threatening.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/us/chattanooga-attacks-claim-a-5th-military-service-members-life.html"}
