The furor it caused prompted Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, to call an urgent news conference to deny the reports.\n“It was an honest mistake,” General Milley told reporters at the Pentagon. “That letter is a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released.”\nThe Iraqi Parliament voted Sunday to expel American forces, reflecting widespread anger with the United States after President Trump ordered the killing of an Iranian military leader, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in Baghdad. But the vote was not the final word on the subject and the Iraqi government had not formally notified the United States to leave.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/middleeast/iran-letter-withdrawal-iraq.html"}
