Oklahoma\nThe court rules 5 to 3 that states may not execute people for crimes committed when they were younger than 16 years old. The decision reverses the death sentence of a 21-year-old Oklahoma man who was 15 when he participated in the murder of his sister’s former husband in January 1983.\nIn his dissent, Justice Scalia said that the Court should not rule as it did today unless there was a ”national consensus that no criminal so much as one day under 16” could ever ”possibly be deemed mature and responsible enough to be punished with death for any crime.” He said there was no such consensus.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/02/14/us/scalia-timeline-listy.html"}
