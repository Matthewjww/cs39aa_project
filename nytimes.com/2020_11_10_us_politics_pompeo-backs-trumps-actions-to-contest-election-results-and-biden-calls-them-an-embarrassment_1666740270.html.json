Biden Jr. called Mr. Trump’s actions since Election Day “an embarrassment.”\nSpeaking to reporters in Delaware, Mr. Biden shrugged off Mr. Pompeo’s comments, saying that his transition was moving along well and that he is confident that Republicans will eventually accept his victory.\n“They will. They will,” he said. Asked about Mr. Trump’s ongoing refusal to concede the election and his vow to continue litigating the outcome in court, Mr. Biden said: “How can I say this tactfully? It will not help the president’s legacy.\"\nMr. Pompeo made his remarks about the next administration in a deadpan voice, followed by a chuckle and a grin. It was not clear if he was joking and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarity. Mr. Biden did not specifically react to Mr. Pompeo’s assertion that he believes there will be a second Trump term.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/pompeo-backs-trumps-actions-to-contest-election-results-and-biden-calls-them-an-embarrassment.html"}
