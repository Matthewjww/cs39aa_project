Its profits are collapsing, its stock is below $2, and last Monday the company got bad news from the Education Department in Washington, a main overseer.\nITT, which operates 138 campuses in 39 states, said it had received a letter from the government demanding $44 million to cover potential obligations that might arise, such as student refunds. The department cited increased risks at ITT as the reason for the demand.\nA call for $44 million may not sound like a death knell. But it was just the latest in a series of setbacks at ITT. And if the past is prologue, the companyâ€™s woes could have dire consequences for its current and former students. The situation has uncanny echoes of a collapse of a for-profit educational institution about two decades ago.\nAccording to its most recent financial statement, ITT provides career-oriented programs to 43,000 students at ITT Technical Institute and Daniel Webster College locations.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/business/woes-for-itt-a-for-profit-school-bode-worse-for-its-students.html"}
