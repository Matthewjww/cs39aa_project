Beggs, former Administrator of the space agency, for the Justice Department's attempt to prosecute him on fraud charges.\nMr. Meese, in a letter to Mr. Beggs dated June 29, wrote that he had reviewed ''the circumstances surrounding the wrongful indictment against you'' and that ''there is no way to undo the pain that you have suffered.''\nThe Attorney General, who announced his resignation on Tuesday, offered ''a profound apology on behalf of the Federal Government and the Department of Justice.''\nMr. Beggs, who became head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1981, said he was pleased and surprised by the letter. ''I've had a year now to get over that ordeal,'' he said. ''I guess I pretty much put it behind me.''", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/07/us/apology-for-ex-nasa-chief.html"}
