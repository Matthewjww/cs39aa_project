Richard Siemens/University of Alberta, via Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\nIn the 1980s, Dr. Houghton, along with two colleagues Qui-Lim Choo and George Kuo, became the first to identify and formally name the hepatitis C virus as the infectious culprit. The work led to the development of a diagnostic test to identify the virus in blood, enabling doctors and researchers for the first time to screen patients and donors.\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia who spent her postdoctoral fellowship working on the hepatitis C virus, described the pathogen as “a tricky virus to work with.” She added that Dr. Houghton’s work, which isolated the virus’s genetic sequence, bolstered the case that it was a new pathogen and distinct from the viruses behind hepatitis A and B.\nDr. Alter and Dr. Houghton later shared the Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research in 2000 for their work.\nDr. Rice’s genetic experiments added important details to scientists’ understanding of the virus, showing that it could be isolated in the lab and cause disease in an animal host, the chimpanzee. These studies nailed the hepatitis C virus as the sole infectious agent responsible for the mysterious “non-A, non-B” cases of hepatitis and set up a crucial animal model for future studies.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/health/nobel-prize-medicine-hepatitis-c.html"}
