But now he has drifted back into his daze. As sad as Ali’s condition is, his personal physician, Dr. Dennis Cope, the director of general internal medicine at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center, contends that there’s no reason now for the 45-year-old three-time heavyweight champion to consider the brain surgery performed by Dr. Ignacio Madrazo of the La Raza Medical Center in Mexico City.\n“It’s still experimental,” said Dr. Cope, who has discussed the operation with Dr. Madrazo. “Of the 18 people who have had the operation, two have died. And there’s a risk of damage to the brain. The surgery should be reserved for someone whose condition is deteriorating, but there’s no evidence that Muhammad is deteriorating. I think he’s very stable. He’s able to function independently. His symptoms are quite mild.” One of Ali’s problems is that he ignores his doctor’s advice. He doesn’t watch his diet. He doesn’t get enough exercise. And he doesn’t always take his medication. But that’s Ali, who as a boxer always preferred to do things his way. And in the ring, his way almost always turned out to be the best way.\nOut of the ring, Ali’s genius has deserted him. Just as Sugar Ray Robinson’s genius has departed. He’s 66 years old now, living in Los Angeles with his wife, Millie, in an upstairs apartment in a nice neighborhood with lawns and small palm trees. When visitors arrive, Millie prompts him. He brightens and addresses his visitors by name. Then he slides into the stupor of the disease that has blanked his memory.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/sports/a-sport-comes-with-a-curse.html"}
