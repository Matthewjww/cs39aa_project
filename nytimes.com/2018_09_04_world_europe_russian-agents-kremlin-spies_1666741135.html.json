In the past, that incentive had been offered only to full-time employees of the intelligence agency.\nThe principal incentive for serving as an informer, however, is rarely money but the promise that legal or other problems will suddenly go away.\nEvgeny Shtorn, a 35-year-old sociologist born in Kazakhstan, recalled how, while working at Mr. Voronkov’s research center in St. Petersburg, he was called to a meeting at the Federal Migration Service to discuss his application for Russian citizenship, which had just been rejected. When he went to the migration service office in December as requested, he was taken upstairs to an unmarked office with security cameras outside.\nMr. Shtorn was met there by a polite man who showed a card identifying him as an officer in the F.S.B. and who explained that he knew all about the failed citizenship application and pretended that he thought this decision very regrettable. “He then very quickly shifted to questions about the research center, about foreign foundations and human rights organizations,” Mr. Shtorn recalled.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/world/europe/russian-agents-kremlin-spies.html"}
