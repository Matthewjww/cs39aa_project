Grassley of Iowa said on Thursday that President Trump had committed to supporting a rewrite of the nation’s federal sentencing laws after November’s elections, breathing life into a long-stalled priority that has united an unlikely coalition of conservatives, libertarians and liberals.\n“He is very satisfied to have this thing come up after the election,” Mr. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said minutes after ending a phone call with Mr. Trump and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has helped push for the changes.\nMr. Grassley said that he and Mr. Kushner had earlier had a “very positive meeting” with Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who signaled he was willing to allow a vote on the legislation during the Senate’s lame-duck session this fall if the bill could draw sufficient support from Republicans.\nThe legislation itself has yet to be finalized but would be more modest than a wide-ranging sentencing and prison overhaul that was introduced with great fanfare in 2015. The compromise language would preserve a suite of key sentencing changes, including reducing some mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, retroactively extending a reduction in the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine and a provision that allows judges greater discretion in sentencing.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/us/politics/trump-criminal-justice-prison-reform.html"}
