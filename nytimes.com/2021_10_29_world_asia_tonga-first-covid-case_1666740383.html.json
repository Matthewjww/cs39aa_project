Christchurch has reported four active community cases in the last two days.\nThe ministry said the individual had been fully vaccinated, and had tested negative for the virus before travel. But a routine test after arrival, on Thursday, returned a positive result the following day. New Zealand health officials are working with Tonga to confirm the case.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/world/asia/tonga-first-covid-case.html"}
