He was 83.\nHis death was announced by his son Pedro.\nMr. Bordaberry had been serving a 30-year sentence under house arrest for orchestrating the coup and for crimes against humanity. He was found guilty of 14 deaths and disappearances related to the dictatorship.\nHis years as president, between 1971 and 1976, are remembered as perhaps the bleakest in Uruguay’s history, marked by a wave of disappearances, torture and killings intended to wipe out the remnants of the leftist Tupamaro guerrilla movement.\nBorn into a wealthy cattle ranching and political family on June 17, 1928, Mr. Bordaberry entered politics through a conservative rural movement, founded in 1951, of which his father, Domingo, was a prominent member.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/world/americas/18bordaberry.html"}
