The revisions should help relieve the burden on the countryâ€™s testing system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\nPreviously, one way to get out of isolation was to have two negative diagnostic tests, also called PCR tests, for the virus taken 24 hours apart. But now there are testing delays of up to two weeks in parts of the country, and numerous studies show that mildly ill people are almost never infectious 10 days after symptoms begin.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/coronavirus-isolation-testing.html"}
