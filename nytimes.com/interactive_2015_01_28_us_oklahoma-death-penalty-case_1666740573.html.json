If the drug does not properly induce unconsciousness, medical experts say that the inmate will suffer excruciating pain. Midazolam was also involved in prolonged, possibly painful executions last year in Ohio and Arizona, and has also been used by Florida in a dozen executions. The states have switched to midazolam because companies making the traditional barbiturates, which have a longer track record and deeper anesthetic properties, have refused to provide them for executions.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/28/us/oklahoma-death-penalty-case.html"}
