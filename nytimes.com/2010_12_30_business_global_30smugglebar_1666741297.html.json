As he spoke he cut long strips of bamboo to tie cords of firewood, using a heavy steel knife with a handmade wooden handle.\nThe water from the new well flowed fresh and clear at first, he said. But now even that well smells of the powerful acids that the miners use in dirt pits to process rare earth minerals needed in the West for sophisticated products ranging from iPhones to giant wind turbines. Plants soon die when irrigated with water from the local streams.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/business/global/30smugglebar.html"}
