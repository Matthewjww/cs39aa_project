His parliamentary record as a serial rebel who frequently defied the party line will also make it hard for him to appeal for loyalty.\nYet the scale of his win may give Mr. Corbyn some time to establish his leadership. In fact Mr. Corbyn, a vegetarian and teetotaler, had to be persuaded to run as the left’s leadership candidate, and he nearly failed to make the ballot paper.\nTo stand, Mr. Corbyn needed 35 nominations from Labour lawmakers, and he scraped enough together only when several of those who did not support him decided he ought to be on the ballot to broaden the debate within the party.\nMr. Corbyn’s victory was then helped by a rule change under which, for just three British pounds, about $4.60, anyone could become a “registered supporter” and take part in the vote. The party, which had around 187,000 members before the May general election, has gained more than 105,000 since, plus 112,000 “registered supporters.” When those affiliated with the party, mainly through unions, are added, more than half a million people had the right to vote, and more than 420,000 ultimately took part.\nOn Saturday, political opponents moved quickly to condemn Labour’s leftward shift. Michael Fallon, the defense secretary, described the opposition party as “a serious risk to our nation’s security, our economy’s security and your family’s security.”\n“Whether it’s weakening our defenses, raising taxes on jobs and earnings, racking up more debt and welfare or driving up the cost of living by printing money — Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will hurt working people,” he said in a statement.\nMore worrying for Mr. Corbyn will be internal critics. Steven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University, said that the emphatic nature of Mr. Corbyn’s victory made it likely that his opponents would keep quiet for some months, and hope for him to trip up.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/world/europe/labour-party-election-jeremy-corbyn.html"}
