Goodman, the F.D.A.’s chief scientist from 2009 to 2014. “And I don’t think they are out of the woods yet.”\nIt has been a bleak year for the F.D.A. and morale is low, according to interviews with high- and midlevel employees over the past six months. F.D.A. scientists and policymakers have questioned whether Dr. Hahn could preserve their scientific integrity in the face of a president who openly calls them untrustworthy actors of the deep state.\nOver the past few tumultuous months, Dr. Hahn has commiserated with Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., who has also been widely criticized for failing to stand up to the White House. At a late September birthday party for Seema Verma, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, Drs. Redfield and Hahn joked about quitting together to open a restaurant, according to several people who were there.\nTo many F.D.A. scientists, Dr. Hahn, an oncologist and former hospital administrator with no experience in Washington, has been a disappointing leader for much of his 10-month tenure. Under his leadership, the F.D.A. authorized hydroxychloroquine for hospitalized Covid-19 patients despite a lack of evidence, only to reverse the decision once the drug was tied to severe side effects.\nIn late August, on the eve of the Republican convention, Dr. Hahn made a significant error at a news conference with the president announcing the approval of plasma treatments for Covid-19. The commissioner greatly exaggerated the benefits of the treatment, angering the scientific community. He publicly corrected the record.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/health/covid-vaccines-fda-trump.html"}
