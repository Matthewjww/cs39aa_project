The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will distribute the money to states in early April and will spend an additional $2.25 billion to expand testing in underserved communities beyond the schools, officials said.\nHow far those moves will go toward reopening schools and reviving the economy is unclear. Experts say the United States does not have nearly enough rapid tests to conduct the kind of routine screening the administration envisions to allow students and teachers to safely return to the classroom.\n“This isn’t going to move the needle,” said Michael Mina, an immunologist and epidemiologist at Harvard who argued that onerous Food and Drug Administration regulations were worsening the coronavirus crisis by preventing new types of rapid antigen tests from being approved.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/us/politics/coronavirus-testing-schools.html"}
