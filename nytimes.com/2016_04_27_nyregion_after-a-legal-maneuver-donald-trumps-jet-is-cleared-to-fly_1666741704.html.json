Trump has managed to get his once-grounded Cessna jet back in the air, by selling it — to himself.\nThe private jet that Mr. Trump has been using to get to and from many campaign events was grounded last week by the Federal Aviation Administration, after The New York Times reported that its registration had expired on Jan. 31.\nThe paperwork problem threatened to ground the 1997 Cessna 750 Citation X for weeks, if not more. But Mr. Trump found a way around this.\nOn Friday, the plane was registered to a new owner, DT Endeavor I, according to records kept with the F.A.A. DT Endeavor I is a limited liability company that was registered in Delaware in early January, and is controlled by Mr. Trump.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/nyregion/after-a-legal-maneuver-donald-trumps-jet-is-cleared-to-fly.html"}
