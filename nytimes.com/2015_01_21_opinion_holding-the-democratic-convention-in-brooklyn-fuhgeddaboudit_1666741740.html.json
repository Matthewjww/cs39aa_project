Philadelphia and Columbus are in the running, but for many, the money is on Brooklyn. And the site does seem attractive: The convention would take place at the Barclays Center, a state-of-the-art arena in the hippest borough of the nation’s media capital.\nBut setting aside the wisdom of hosting a Democratic convention in the bluest spot east of Berkeley, the committee should look elsewhere. Brooklyn and Barclays are a logistical and ethical minefield.\nFirst, logistics. Despite an estimated 2,000 hotel rooms in Downtown Brooklyn, most of the expected 35,000 visitors will sleep in Manhattan. Though the arena is quite accessible by subway, the city has proposed moving thousands of delegates along temporary dedicated bus lanes across the bridges and through Downtown Brooklyn — a potential traffic mess along an already congested corridor.\nMore important, the Barclays Center’s neighborhood setting — a busy commercial center shoehorned into a dense residential zone — means there will be little parking available and little margin of error for vehicles serving the arena and the trucks going to its loading docks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/opinion/holding-the-democratic-convention-in-brooklyn-fuhgeddaboudit.html"}
