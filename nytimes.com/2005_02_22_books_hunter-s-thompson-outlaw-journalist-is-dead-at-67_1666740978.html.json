He was educated in public schools and joined the United States Air Force after high school. There he was introduced to journalism, covering sports for an Air Force newspaper in Florida. He was honorably discharged in 1958 and then worked a series of jobs writing for small-town newspapers. Even before he burst onto the national scene, Mr. Thompson had built a reputation as an eccentric, hard-driving reporter in upstate New York.\nMr. Thompson's biography has traditional contours. But in a Playboy interview given years ago, the magazine filled in some of the profile with Thompsonesque details. In the introduction to his interview, the magazine said he lied to get the job at a base newspaper; was fired when his superiors found out he was writing for another publication under a pen name; and was fired from a newspaper job for destroying his editor's car.\nIn that interview, Mr. Thompson said that he found his literary voice -- a highly personal controlled rant that became known, somewhat inexplicably, as gonzo journalism -- while writing a story about the Kentucky Derby for Scanlan's magazine.\n\"I'd blown my mind, couldn't work,\" he told Playboy, explaining how he could not get the story done for deadline. \"So finally I just started jerking pages out of my notebook and numbering them and sending them to the printer. I was sure it was the last article I was ever going to do for anybody.\" The article was a success, and Mr. Thompson said \"if I can write like this and get away with it, why should I keep trying to write like The New York Times?\"\nMr. Thompson had some early success as a foreign correspondent writing from South America for The National Observer. But it was his first book -- \"Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga\" (Modern Library, 1967) -- that quickly established his reputation for producing what Eliot Fremont-Smith, in The Times, called an \"angry, knowledgeable and excitedly written book.\"\nMr. Thompson, who spent more than a year traveling with the Hell's Angels, gave the nation a tongue lashing for creating mythic villains, like the motorcycle gang, which he revealed to be more pathetic than fearsome.\nMr. Thompson wrote about a dozen books, including \"Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail,\" the culmination of his work on the 1972 campaign. In his political coverage Mr. Thompson made no secret of his hatred of Nixon, once calling him \"that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/22/books/hunter-s-thompson-outlaw-journalist-is-dead-at-67.html"}
