Biden Jr.’s decisive victory in the state by appointing new electors.\nMr. Trump may have a tough sell during the meeting, which is expected to take place on Friday, and also include the Republican speaker of the Michigan House, Lee Chatfield.\nMr. Shirkey has committed to heading a legislative probe into “numerous allegations” of election irregularities. But he has balked at overturning the results, and publicly questioned the president for not accepting an official accounting that shows Mr. Biden with a lead of nearly 150,000 votes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/us/mike-shirkey-trump.html"}
