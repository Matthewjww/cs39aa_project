And illness has certainly taken a toll at the Metropolitan Opera this winter, as it did on Thursday night for the first performance of Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos” in a revival of Elijah Moshinsky’s slightly surreal 1994 production.\nThe Canadian tenor Lance Ryan, who has sung Wagner’s Siegfried to acclaim, was to have made his much anticipated Met debut as Bacchus. But he was sick and had to withdraw. The American tenor Michael Hendrick, an experienced Bacchus, took over.\nAs it turned out, Mr. Hendrick was grappling with a cold as well. He went on, but he requested the audience’s understanding, a Met spokesman announced from the stage.\nBacchus is a relatively short yet notoriously punishing heldentenor role. Clearly struggling, Mr. Hendrick dropped some phrases and skipped some top notes. Still, the basic components of his burly voice came through, and he survived the big final duet with Ariadne.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/06/arts/music/06ariadne.html"}
