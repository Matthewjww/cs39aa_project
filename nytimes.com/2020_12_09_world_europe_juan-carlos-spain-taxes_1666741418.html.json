But the announcement came just a month after Spanish media revealed an investigation into possible tax evasion and money laundering based on the former king and his relatives using those bank accounts to pay their credit card charges.\nThe anticorruption prosecutor’s office has confirmed the existence of a new case involving the king, but has not elaborated. He was already the subject of another investigation by the same office.\nThe credit card payments took place after Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014, which could mean that he is not shielded by the immunity from prosecution he enjoyed as head of state. The extent of that immunity has become an issue in the previous corruption case, but it remains an unsettled question.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/world/europe/juan-carlos-spain-taxes.html"}
