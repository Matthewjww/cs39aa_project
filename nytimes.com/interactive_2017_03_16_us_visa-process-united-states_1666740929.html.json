Here is the typical process:\n1. Submit the nonimmigrant visa application online.\n2. Pay the application fee at a designated bank and sign up for an interview.\n3. Gather documents to show that you have a stable life and are not likely to overstay your visa. Recommended documents: A. A letter of introduction from your employer B. An invitation letter from the U.S. C. Your passport D. Bank statements E. Anything else that might prove that you intend to return home.\n4. The interview. In some countries, it can take up to four months to get an interview. On the appointed date, you will meet with a Foreign Service officer. The officer could deny your request, sometimes without even looking at your documents. He or she could also refer your case for a deeper review.\n5. Your information is checked against American and foreign databases. Officers from various U.S. agencies will also conduct interviews and do further research into your background.\n6. If everything checks out, a visa is issued.\n7. At the airport, American customs officers do an additional round of behind-the-scenes screening.\n8. Upon arrival, you are questioned by customs officers and may be screened again.\nWhere Applications Are Denied Most\n20% 40% 60% Highest refusal rates in fiscal year 2015 Palau 96% Guinea-Bissau 65 Micronesia 86 Somalia 65 Cuba 76 Syria 63 Gambia 76 Ghana 63 Laos 67 Liberia 62 Syria Afghanistan 63% 61% Mauritania 61% Cuba 76% Laos Haiti 60% 67% El Salvador 46% Ghana Liberia Somalia 62% 63% 65% Refusal rates by country in fiscal year 2015 October 2014 to September 2015 20% 40% 60% Syria 63% Mauritania 61% Cuba 76% Guinea- Bissau Laos Afghanistan Haiti 60% 67% 61% 65% El Salvador 46% Liberia Ghana Somalia 62% 63% 65% Refusal rates by country in fiscal year 2015 October 2014 to September 2015 20% 40% 60% Source: U.S. State Department, Bureau of Consular Affairs | Note: Rates for B visas (tourist and business visitors) shown.\nApplication denials vary by country, and applicants are typically not told why they are denied. Thirteen countries had a denial rate of over 60 percent in 2015. The highest rates were in African and Middle Eastern countries, including Ghana, Syria and Somalia. Cuba and Laos also had high denial rates.\nEntering the U.S. Without a Visa\nVisitors from the 38 countries that are members of the visa-waiver program don’t have to follow all the steps above. But they still have to provide personal information to the American government before they can board a plane to the United States. Many citizens of Canada and Bermuda can also visit the United States without a visa.\nMembers of the visa-waiver program Europe 30 Andorra , Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , Ireland , Italy , Latvia , Liechtenstein , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , Monaco , Netherlands , Norway , Portugal , San Marino , Slovakia , Slovenia , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland , United Kingdom , Asia and Oceania 7 Australia , Brunei , Japan , New Zealand , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , South America 1 Chile ,\nMost travelers from countries in the visa-waiver program may visit the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. They go through a shorter process and pay a smaller fee than visa travelers do. They apply for travel authorization by submitting personal information, including employment, communicable diseases and criminal history. After arriving, Customs and Border Protection officers make the final decision regarding entry.\nThe United States changed waiver eligibility for certain visitors last year, after the 2015 Paris attacks. People who had traveled to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen since 2011 became ineligible.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/16/us/visa-process-united-states.html"}
