It’s not necessarily easy for Times Opinion columnists to engage in public self-reproach, but we hope that in doing so, they can be models of how valuable it can be to admit when you get things wrong.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/07/21/opinion/nyt-columnists-i-was-wrong.html"}
