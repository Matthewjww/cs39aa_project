He had been described as a close friend and adviser of Prince Mohammed, but Saudi state media reported several weeks after Mr. Khashoggi’s death that he had been dismissed from his post.\nBefore it was suspended, Mr. Qahtani’s Twitter account had 1.3 million followers. But the account had largely gone silent after Mr. Khashoggi’s death last year.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/technology/twitter-suspension-middle-east.html"}
