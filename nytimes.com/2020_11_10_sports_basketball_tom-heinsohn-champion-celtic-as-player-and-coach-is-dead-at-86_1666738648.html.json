He was 86.\nJeff Twiss, a Celtics spokesman, said the cause was renal failure, adding that Heinsohn had had multiple illnesses, including diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.\nPlaying on the parquet floor of the old Boston Garden from 1956 to 1965, Heinsohn brought a superb shooting touch to the dynasty engineered by Coach Red Auerbach. He loved to shoot, most famously hitting flat-trajectory jumpers, and he had a deadly running hook.\nHeinsohn was the N.B.A.â€™s rookie of the year in 1957, capping the season by scoring 37 points when the Celtics defeated the St. Louis Hawks for the first N.B.A. championship in their history. He was a six-time All-Star.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/sports/basketball/tom-heinsohn-champion-celtic-as-player-and-coach-is-dead-at-86.html"}
