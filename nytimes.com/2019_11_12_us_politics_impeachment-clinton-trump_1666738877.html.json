And I recorded a call with him, so let me play it for you.\nYes. I’m trying to figure out a lot more about it, so I can — yeah, I’m very interested in it.\nSo I heard that you are interested in the impeachment. Is that true?\nHey, Leo. Can you hear me O.K.?\nSo on Monday, I went to Leo’s house and we talked a bit more. Where are you with understanding the impeachment now? Do you feel like you understand everything that’s going on?\nMost of it. Most of it.\nAnd where was this?\nLeo doesn’t really have other kids he can talk about the impeachment with.\nSo I came up with an idea.\nI was thinking the person you could talk to is this political reporter named Mike Schmidt.\nI talked to her, and she said it’s O.K.\nI can ask my mom about that.\nI was thinking that since you have more questions, you could come to The New York Times and talk to one of our political reporters.\nWe were checking out his accomplishments.\nWe spent 45 minutes coming up with his top questions.\nWhat is “quid pro quo?” How many people are listening when the president makes a phone call? What are the hearings?\nAnd then we spent another 45 minutes picking out his outfit.\nAnd what did he ended up going with?\nYou remember the name of the host?\nGreat. Well, so Mike is on a train from Washington, D.C. that gets in right at 10:00, and he’s going to rush here. And so yeah, do you want to come in? Great. O.K., this is us. So are you feeling nervous?\nDid you work on your questions anymore or just —\nHi, Leo. Welcome to The New York Times.\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the House of Representatives begins public hearings this morning in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Before those hearings get underway, Mike Schmidt sits down with someone who’s unafraid to ask all the questions we’ve been too embarrassed to ask.\nleo\nIt’s Wednesday, November 13th.\nmichael barbaro\nBravo. Do you feel like you’re at the right height? Do you want anything?\nleo\nNo, I’m O.K.\nmichael barbaro\nO.K. You’re a very unfussy guest. So how is it that you got interested in the impeachment?\nleo\nWell, I was in the car with my mom, and I was driving to my grandma’s house, and she was listening to the radio, and I heard them talking about it on the radio.\nmichael barbaro\nMm-hm.\nleo\nI asked my mom about it, and I think I asked, like, can you explain what’s happening to me is? Because I don’t really understand it.\nmichael barbaro\nMm-hm.\nleo\nThere were a lot of words I didn’t really know.\nmichael barbaro\nMm-hm.\nleo\nAt first I didn’t know what the whistleblower was.\nmichael barbaro\nThat word?\nleo\nYeah. She explained it in a really good way, so now I know.\nmichael barbaro\nMm-hm. What’s your understanding of what a whistleblower is?\nleo\nIt could be anyone. Whistleblower can be anyone, who was either in the room or doing something that let him hear what the president was saying to the president of Ukraine.\nmichael barbaro\nMm-hm.\nleo\nAnd he knew it’s very bad. He can’t threaten another president to help him win the next election. So he reported it to the House of Representatives.\nmichael barbaro\nDo you know where that phrase comes from, whistleblower?\nleo\nOh, because, for example, in sports, if someone does something wrong, like breaking the rules of the game, they would blow a whistle or something like that and —\nmichael barbaro\nRight.\nleo\nThey would m you can’t do that. That’s wrong.\nmichael barbaro\nRight.\nleo\nYeah.\nmichael barbaro\nYeah, I have the image of being at a pool with the lifeguard. And the lifeguard’s like —\nleo\nYeah, yeah. [WHISTLES]\nmichael barbaro\nHey, knock it off.\nleo\nI was at Delaware Beach once, and we saw dolphins. Someone tried to go swim after them, and he had to blow his whistle and say, you can’t go that far. Come back.\nmichael barbaro\nRight, same concept. Do not chase after dolphins. Do not ask the president of Ukraine to do you a political favor. Right.\nbianca giaever\nLeo, do you want to show Michael the drawings of the impeachment you made?\nleo\nO.K.\nmichael barbaro\nYeah, what do you have in this bag?\nleo\nI only did one, but — [UNZIPPING] There’s all of this.\nmichael barbaro\nHey, can you tell me what this is from your backpack?\nleo\nThis?\nmichael barbaro\nYeah.\nleo\nIt’s a book about the parts of the government.\nmichael barbaro\nWhat’s it called?\nleo\nWhat Are The Parts of Government.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd where did you get it from?\nleo\nThe library.\nmichael barbaro\nWas it in high demand? Was there a competition to get it?\nleo\nNo.\nmichael barbaro\nNo.\nleo\nBarely anyone who was even in the aisle.\nmichael barbaro\nDo you have other people in your life friends, classmates, who are also interested in the impeachment?\nleo\nNo.\nmichael barbaro\nNo. Like your brother, right?\nleo\nYeah, he doesn’t really care.\nmichael barbaro\nWhat does he care about?\nleo\nHe really likes animals, especially reptiles.\nmichael barbaro\nHmm. Which is why this is exactly the right place for you to be. Because we are very interested.\nleo\nYeah. Yeah, if you want to like at — do you want to look at that questions?\nmichael barbaro\nYeah, sure, let me review them for you.\nleo\nThese are questions for Mike.\nmichael barbaro\nThese are questions for Mike Schmidt?\nleo\nThis was the original one, but then I typed it.\nmichael barbaro\nSmart thinking. Great. These are great questions. So I think Mike is close. So maybe we’ll have you do the “we’ll be right back” thing. Do you want to try that?\nleo\nO.K. “We’ll be right back.”\nmichael barbaro\nNice job. Mike Schmidt.\nmichael schmidt\nHi, guys.\nbianca giaever\nHi.\nleo\nHi.\nmichael schmidt\nHi. What’s happening? How are you?\nleo\nGood.\nmichael schmidt\nNice to meet you.\nleo\nNice to meet you.\nmichael schmidt\nThanks for coming in.\nleo\nYou’re welcome.\nmichael schmidt\nThanks for waiting for me. I’m sorry I’m late.\nleo\nIt’s O.K.\nmichael barbaro\nYeah.\nmichael schmidt\nIt’s good to see you, too. [LAUGHTER]\nmichael barbaro\nWelcome. Leo, Mike. Mike, Leo.\nmichael schmidt\nWhat grade are you in, Leo?\nleo\nThird.\nmichael schmidt\nThird? What do you learn in third grade?\nleo\nI learn division and, um —\nmichael schmidt\nDivision, as in math?\nleo\nYes.\nmichael schmidt\nNot the division of the country.\nleo\nNo.\nmichael barbaro\nLeo, you have these questions for Mike. Do you want to read some of them?\nleo\nYeah.\nmichael barbaro\nGo.\nleo\nSo first, how many presidents have been impeached? I think it’s three.\nmichael schmidt\nSo it’s two. It’s Clinton.\nleo\nOh, yes. Bill Clinton.\nmichael schmidt\nBill Clinton. And it’s Andrew Johnson.\nleo\nYeah.\nmichael schmidt\nI think I know why you think that it was three, because there was this other President, Richard Nixon, who —\nleo\nYeah, he did something very bad, and he knew he was going to get impeached. So he quit being president, because he knew even if he didn’t quit, he would be impeached. So —\nmichael schmidt\nNailed it.\nleo\nHe quit before he could even get impeached.\nmichael schmidt\nRight. Do you know what a quid pro quo is?\nleo\nThat’s actually one of my questions, but now I know. I heard it on a podcast. It means “this for that.”\nmichael schmidt\nThat’s right.\nmichael barbaro\nYeah, it’s the Latin.\nmichael schmidt\nThat’s right.\nleo\nYeah, it’s in Latin.\nmichael schmidt\nFavor for a favor.\nleo\nI don’t really think it is, because the president of Ukraine is really just doing a favor for Trump. He just said that if you don’t, then he’ll stop giving you money. So he’s basically threatening the president.\nmichael barbaro\nSo you don’t — it’s interesting, Mike. I wonder if you’d agree with this. It feels like what Leo is saying is, I’m not so sure this is a quid pro quo, because it’s more like a threat without a favor back to Ukraine.\nmichael schmidt\nNo, you hit on one of the biggest criticisms of how this thing is described. Which is essentially that a quid pro quo doesn’t really capture what it’s all about. A quid pro quo is like, hey, if I do this for you, I’ll give you my Cheeze-Its, and you give me half of your peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This is not that good of a deal. This is more like, I’ve been giving you lunch money every day. But if you want me to keep giving you lunch money, you have to go throw this banana peel on the ground, so this person I don’t like will come along and slip and fall.\nleo\nYes, it’s not fair to the president of Ukraine.\nmichael schmidt\nAnd when you heard about it, what was your first reaction to it? What did you think?\nleo\nI thought that, well, it’s a bad thing to do, what Trump’s doing. And also, I thought about who the whistleblower was, if it’s a boy or a girl, or who or what.\nmichael schmidt\nDo you know if it’s a boy or a girl?\nleo\nNo, that’s actually one of my questions.\nmichael schmidt\nO.K.\nmichael barbaro\nBut you do know?\nmichael schmidt\nI do know.\nleo\nReally?\nmichael schmidt\nYeah. It’s a boy.\nleo\nO.K.\nmichael schmidt\nThe whistleblower worked for the C.I.A., and at one point worked inside the White House.\nleo\nYeah, Mike, one of my questions was, does the whistleblower work for government?\nmichael schmidt\nHe does. So Leo, why do you think that it is that Ukraine isn’t saying they’re upset with Trump?\nleo\nWell, the president of Ukraine might be kind of scared, because they need the money. And when Donald Trump threatens the Ukrainian president that he’s not going to give them money anymore, they get kind of scared. If he says that and reports it and Trump gets in trouble, he’ll get really mad, and he can say — while he’s still in office, he can say I’ll stop giving you money. Which I think the president of Ukraine is scared of, because he wants the people in Ukraine to be safe and feel safe there.\nmichael schmidt\nThat’s really smart analysis, Leo.\nleo\nBut this is a question. Does other countries, other than America, Ukraine, and Russia, do they know about this, that they could also go to Trump and do what Ukraine could do?\nmichael schmidt\nTotally. It’s almost certainly being heard around the world by other countries. But you raise a good question, which is, hey, if this is going on with Ukraine, why wouldn’t it go on with any of the other dozens or hundreds of countries in the world?\nleo\nAnd also, has this happened to other countries before?\nmichael schmidt\nWe don’t know. I mean, the funny thing is that we even forget that in the middle of this whole story. Donald Trump came out and basically said that the Chinese should do the same thing that he wanted the Ukrainians to do. But I had forgotten about that.\nmichael barbaro\nWhich is to investigate connections between Joe Biden and China.\nmichael schmidt\nCorrect.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd Hunter Biden.\nmichael schmidt\nHe said it right outside the White House.\nleo\nI didn’t know. That’s new to me. I didn’t know that yet.\nmichael schmidt\nWhat do you think of that?\nleo\nSo he’s trying to get China to do what he tried to get Ukraine to do?\nmichael schmidt\nYes.\nleo\nInvestigate Joe Biden?\nmichael schmidt\nJoe Biden’s son.\nleo\nAll right. When and why did America start giving Ukraine money? And all the other countries, too.\nmichael schmidt\nSo a few decades ago, there was this big thing called the Cold War. And the United States wanted to help the Ukrainians. Ukraine had been part of the U.S.S.R., which was the old version of Russia. And the Ukrainians were sort of going out on their own and trying to become their own country. And the United States went to them and said, hey, we can help you. We can help create a democracy in your country, and we can give you money to get off the ground to sort of build yourself up as a country.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd protect yourself from Russia.\nmichael schmidt\nCorrect. Well, it was to strengthen the country. It’s not until many, many years later that we start giving them military aid, this whole thing that’s come up in the quid pro quo call. But we were becoming friends with them. We thought if we could create more democracies in Europe and next to Russia. we could contain the Russians and help people have the same freedoms that we do.\nleo\nAll right, what are the hearings? The next one’s good.\nmichael schmidt\nSo the hearings start today. And the hearings are these public events, where the Democrats are going to bring different witnesses, people that were working in the government on Ukraine issues. The Democrats are going to bring them forward in public on TV and ask them questions. so they can say what they knew what was going on with Ukraine and the aid and Trump pressuring them. Does that make sense?\nleo\nYeah.\nmichael barbaro\nWhy are they public? And why is that important?\nmichael schmidt\nThe Democrats are trying to build an argument for the country that there is a good reason to impeach the president. And they think doing it in public where we can all watch on TV will have a greater impact.\nleo\nYeah, all right.\nmichael schmidt\nDoes that make any sense?\nleo\nKind of. [CHUCKLING]\nmichael schmidt\nI get confused, too. I get confused, too. What do you think about the fact that the Democrats think they need to have public hearings to convince people that what Trump did was wrong, that a lot of people in the country don’t think that’s a problem?\nleo\nBecause they think that it’s just doing like one thing. They know it’s bad, but they don’t think it’s bad enough for him to get kicked out of office.\nmichael schmidt\nMm-hm.\nleo\nThey know it’s bad. They definitely know it’s bad, but I don’t think they don’t think it’s bad enough.\nmichael schmidt\nI think the most recent argument from Republicans would be that simply doing what he did is not enough to remove him from office.\nmichael barbaro\nDo you have any more questions for Mike?\nleo\nUh, all right. So when will we know if the president gets impeached? If he does get impeached, when will the public find out?\nmichael schmidt\nMy editors ask me this question every day. I think we may have an answer by December or January. So just a couple of months away. And if he’s impeached, then this would be sent to the Senate, where there would be a trial, six days a week, national television, the senators deciding whether to take out Trump.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd when would that be decided by?\nmichael schmidt\nWell, early next year. But the problem, Leo, is, in Washington, everything always takes longer than we think it’s going to. So maybe it’s the spring when we get some clarity.\nmichael barbaro\nLeo, I want you to ask this question, which I think might be one of our last questions in this conversation with Mike, do you mind asking that?\nleo\nWhat are we going to see this week, in the coming weeks?\nmichael schmidt\nWe’re going to see hearings. We’re going to see the first one on Wednesday, where a senior State Department official, who had big concerns about what Trump was doing, is going to testify publicly. And then on Friday, another State Department official who was involved in all this stuff is going to testify in public again. And then next week, we’ll see the same thing but with different witnesses. And this will be the Democrats trying to argue to the country why this is so important and why the president should be impeached.\nmichael barbaro\nLeo, I have to leave and head to Washington to cover the first hearing that Mike just described, but I’m curious, what has been the most interesting thing that you have learned here today from Mike Schmidt?\nleo\nI think it’s — I learned this, and I didn’t know it until today. I didn’t know about the Cold War.\nmichael barbaro\nHm!\nleo\nBetween America and Russia. I found that really interesting.\nmichael barbaro\nYeah, it’s a big part of the story, actually.\nmichael schmidt\nLeo, what’s your prediction about what’s going to happen at the hearings?\nleo\nYeah, I think he’s going to get impeached in the House, but he’ll be O.K. He won’t — not enough people will vote in the Senate.\nmichael schmidt\nSo you think he’s going to end up staying in office?\nleo\nYes.\nmichael schmidt\nSo that’s your prediction?\nleo\nYes.\nmichael schmidt\nThat’s what I think, too, unless something big changes.\nleo\nYeah.\nmichael schmidt\nLeo, I think you know as much as I do now. So I think we’re done here. You say some of this stuff in a clearer way than anyone else I’ve heard.\nmichael barbaro\nDo you want to show Mike the impeachment drawing?\nleo\nO.K.\nmichael schmidt\nOh. [CHUCKLING]\nleo\nThat’s a person. It’s a person in a suit blowing a whistle.\nmichael schmidt\nWith Donald Trump’s hair.\nleo\nThat’s Donald Trump’s hair?\nmichael schmidt\nI don’t know. I thought so at first. So this is the whistleblower, and he’s blowing his whistle.\nmichael barbaro\nAnonymous no more.\nmichael schmidt\nWith the words “squee” coming out of his mouth. [LAUGHTER]\nmichael barbaro\nMike, thank you very much. Leo, thank you so very much. It was a pleasure to meet you, and I look forward to some day coming on your podcast. Get it. [CHUCKLING] We’ll speak soon.\nleo\nThank you.\nmichael barbaro", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/impeachment-clinton-trump.html"}
