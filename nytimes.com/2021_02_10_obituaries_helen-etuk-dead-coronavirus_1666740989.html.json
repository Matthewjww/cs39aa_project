Her mother said that even though Ms. Etuk had worn a mask and had tried to maintain distance from other people, she developed a bad cough that turned out to be a symptom of Covid-19.\n“She blamed herself, saying she made a mistake in going back to school,” Ms. Clinton said. “She said that sometimes students pull their masks down, so they cover their mouths but not their noses.”\nHer daughter was hospitalized for almost three months before she died.\nHelen Otobong Etuk was born on Feb. 22, 2000, in Dallas. Her mother works as a health care consultant. Her father, Bassey Etuk, an Army veteran, was not involved in raising her.\nIn addition to her mother, Ms. Etuk is survived by three older brothers, Jeffrey, Jeremy and Joseph Ayisire, and an older sister, Linda Ayisire.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/obituaries/helen-etuk-dead-coronavirus.html"}
