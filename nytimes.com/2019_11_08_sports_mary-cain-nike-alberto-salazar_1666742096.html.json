Salazar has denied giving athletes performance-enhancing drugs.\nNike also said in a statement that “Mary was seeking to rejoin the Oregon Project and Alberto’s team as recently as April of this year and had not raised these concerns as part of that process.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/sports/mary-cain-nike-alberto-salazar.html"}
