Gen. Winant Sidle, said that one version, the CBU‐55, had been tested in South Vietnam in 1970 for the clearing of helicopter pads but had been found to be inaccurate.\n“It could be that's what the stories have been talking about,” General Sidle said. The bombs might be.capable of using all the air within 20 yards and suffocating troops, he added.\nHe said the bombs, which create very high pressures over the ground by explosions of aerosol, were never designed to be antipersonnel weapons.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/04/25/archives/comment-by-pentagon.html"}
