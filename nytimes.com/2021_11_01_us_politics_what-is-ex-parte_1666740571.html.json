The Supreme Court held that state officials could be sued in federal court to prevent them from trying to enforce unconstitutional laws.\nHowever, the court’s majority decision, written by Justice Rufus W. Peckham, said that this mechanism could not be used to “restrain the state court from acting in any case brought before it either of a civil or criminal nature.”\nHe added: “An injunction by a federal court against a state court would violate the whole scheme of this government, and it does not follow that, because an individual may be enjoined from doing certain things, a court may be similarly enjoined.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/us/politics/what-is-ex-parte.html"}
