Mr. Christie has expertise in law enforcement and criminal justice issues, experience running a government and dealing with immigration issues, all of which could be valuable qualities. Mr. Trump may also appreciate that Mr. Christie is a fellow executive and plain-speaking leader.\nWhat Christie Might Say: Mr. Christie is set to leave office in early 2018, and he has expressed openness to considering another role in government. He is clearly interested in the presidency, having run an aggressive campaign, and, at 53, he could easily run again in 2024 after two Trump terms. But he may be more likely to be looking at a cabinet position or other job in the administration, if Mr. Trump decides that Mr. Christie doesn’t bring enough to the ticket or is too tainted by controversies like the George Washington Bridge scandal.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/01/us/politics/donald-trump-running-mate.html"}
