At a time of great confusion, investors are hoping for some clarity.\nInterest rates, which raise costs for companies, have increased since the summer, the last time investors heard from corporate leaders. At the same time, consumer spending and employment have held up, so there is a chance that company earnings will be robust, too.\nBut many investors are fretting that the Federal Reserve’s determination to tame inflation and cool the economy will have caught up with company performance by now, denting sales and profits in the third quarter. That could prompt companies to lay off workers and cut investment in the coming months, which would increase the chances of a recession in the United States. Others on Wall Street see signs that inflation is beginning to fall, which could lower the likelihood of a downturn and protect companies from big financial hits.\nThe to and fro of competing narratives highlights the uncertainty that many on Wall Street are experiencing. It has been evident in the stock markets as well. A brief rally to start the month gave way to further selling, as optimism, not for the first time this year, gave way to renewed concern over the outlook for the economy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/12/business/wall-street-mixed-quarterly-earnings.html"}
