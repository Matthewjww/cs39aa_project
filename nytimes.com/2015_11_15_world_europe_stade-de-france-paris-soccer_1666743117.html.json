Mr. Deschamps seriously considered telling the French players, according to a high-ranking official with the French soccer federation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, but ultimately decided against it because, at that time, the extent of the violence was unknown. Mr. Löw did the same.\nThe coaches’ decisions, along with typically spotty cellphone reception during major events at the cavernous Stade de France just north of Paris, made for a surreal atmosphere: The players played and most of the fans cheered as usual, unaware of what was going on around them, while a smattering of coaches, officials and journalists (all of whom had access to the Internet) grimly followed the escalating carnage of the coordinated terrorist attacks that killed at least 129 people and injured scores more.\n“It was so weird,” said Cyril Olivès-Berthet, who was covering the match for the French sports newspaper L’Équipe. “The players were running and doing their game, and the fans were chanting their normal chants, ‘Aux Armes, Aux Armes,’ a typical chant that is a warrior thing about taking arms and going to war. When France scored the second goal late in the game, they all waved their flags, and the players celebrated like they always do.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/world/europe/stade-de-france-paris-soccer.html"}
