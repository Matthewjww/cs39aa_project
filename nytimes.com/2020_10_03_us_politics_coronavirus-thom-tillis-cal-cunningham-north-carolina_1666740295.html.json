That news came nearly three hours after Mr. Tillis announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and would close his campaign headquarters, in a devastating blow to his already lagging re-election campaign.\nIn a normal election cycle, either development alone would have registered as head-spinning.\n“I thought, ‘Oh God, now what,’” said Michael Bitzer, a political analyst and political science professor at Catawba College in North Carolina.\nBut taken together, Mr. Cunningham’s scandal and Mr. Tillis’s diagnosis have upended the critical race just a month before Election Day, laying waste to both candidates’ core messages just as they were preparing to make their final appeals to voters.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/us/politics/coronavirus-thom-tillis-cal-cunningham-north-carolina.html"}
