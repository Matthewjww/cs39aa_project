Putin of Russia from invading Ukraine. Instead, his country did just that while they were delivering their speeches.\n“Unfortunately, while we’ve been meeting in the Security Council tonight, it appears that President Putin has ordered that last step,” said the U.S. ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “This is a grave emergency.”\nThe United States said the Council would meet on Thursday to vote on a resolution condemning Russia’s actions. A European diplomat said earlier in the day that the resolution had been circulated among Council members and had wide support.\nIt was unclear whether the text would be adjusted to reflect Mr. Putin’s announcement. But in any case, the resolution is likely to be vetoed by Russia.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/un-security-council-russia-ukraine.html"}
