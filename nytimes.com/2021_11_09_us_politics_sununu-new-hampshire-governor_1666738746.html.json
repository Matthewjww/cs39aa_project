Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican, surprised his party on Tuesday by announcing that he would not run for U.S. Senate next year, rejecting a full-court press from national Republicans who tried to recruit him to compete for a Democratic-held seat that the G.O.P. believed could determine control of the Senate.\nInstead, Mr. Sununu announced that he would seek a fourth two-year term as governor, a job in which he said he could make more of a difference than in Congress, where “too often doing nothing is considered a win.”\n“My responsibility is not to the gridlock and politics of Washington,” he said at a news conference. “It is to the citizens of New Hampshire.”\nRepublican leaders had seen a Sununu challenge to Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, as one of their best shots to upend the Senate’s 50-50 partisan split, which gives Democrats control with the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/us/politics/sununu-new-hampshire-governor.html"}
