The company was already all digital (he wanted no print or traditional media), had vertical content (the topics are specialized), and had a large “in-market” audience (people looking to buy something).\n“If you’re reading five printer reviews, I probably have a sense that you are in the market for a printer,” Mr. Shah said. “There are signals that we can begin to study that will give us a view as to who is a buyer of what. We think there’s a value to be created from that.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/business/media/05ziff.html?dbk"}
