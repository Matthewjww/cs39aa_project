But as a convicted rapist seeking to re-enter the professional game after his release from prison last week, he has suddenly become the focal point of an impassioned national debate.\nThe issue: whether Evans, 25, a striker whose résumé includes largely unheralded stints at Manchester City, Norwich City, Sheffield United and a place on the national team of Wales, should be allowed to return to the sport, or be excluded on moral grounds from any further playing career, at least in the professional leagues.\nEngland’s professional soccer clubs are no strangers to controversy over the behavior of players who breach sporting and social codes on and off the field. Episodes of racial abuse and violence against opponents, including several involving some of the top players in the sport, have resulted in a long succession of suspensions and fines.\nEvans’s case, and the emotions and public reaction to his effort to return to the field, echo a continuing debate in the United States — set off by the recent arrests of several prominent N.F.L. players for charges including domestic violence and child abuse — about whether an athlete’s actions off the field should have consequences on it.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/sports/soccer/convicted-of-rape-ched-evans-is-hoping-to-play-again.html"}
