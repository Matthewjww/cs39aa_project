In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using “bot” accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/twitter-russia-election.html"}
