Mid, TV crews walking into Oval Office 2. SOUNDBITE (English) Barack Obama, US President: “I just received a briefing from FBI Director Comey as well as my White House team about the tragic shooting that took place in Chattanooga today. We don’t know yet all the details. We know that what appears to be a lone gunman carried out these attacks. We’ve identified a name and at this point a full investigation is taking place. The FBI will be taking the lead, working closely with local law enforcement. But we’ve also been in contact with the Department of Defense to make sure that all our defense facilities remain properly attentive and vigilant as we sort through exactly what happened. And, as details of the investigation proceed, we will make sure that the FBI as well as local law enforcement are providing the public with all the information that is involved. My main message right now is, obviously, the deepest sympathies of the American people to the four Marines that have been killed. It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals who have served our country with great valor to be killed in this fashion. And, although the families are still in the process of being contacted, I want them to know that I speak for the American people in expressing our deepest condolences and knowing that they have our full support as they try to overcome the grief that is involved here. I also want to say that there are reports of injuries to Chattanooga local law enforcement officials. Thankfully as we know at this point they have survived the assault and they know that we are thinking of them, our thoughts and prayers. We take all shootings very seriously. Obviously when you have an attack on a US military facility then we have to make sure that we have all the information necessary to make an assessment in terms of how this attack took place and what further precautions we can take in the future. And, as we have more information we’ll let the public know. But in the meantime I would ask all Americans to pray for the families who are grief stricken at this point and I want everybody to understand that we will be thorough and prompt in figuring out what has happened. Thank you very much.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/us/chattanooga-gunmans-past-scoured-for-extremist-ties.html?ref=us"}
