Police on the scene did not stop the gunman until well over an hour after he walked into the school, raising questions about whether lives could have been saved if they had acted sooner. Parents who rushed to the school were held outside, where many were forced to wait to learn if their children were safe.\nWhat follows is an account of each of those 78 minutes, as told by video evidence, statements by witnesses and law enforcement, and accounts of 911 calls.\nThe toll — 19 students and two teachers dead, and more than a dozen others wounded — would not be released until many hours later.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/28/us/school-shooting-timeline-uvalde-texas.html"}
