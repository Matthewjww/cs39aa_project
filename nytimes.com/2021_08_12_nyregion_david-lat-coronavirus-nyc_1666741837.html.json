At first I was getting my blood tested every few weeks because they were looking for different markers for immunity: antibodies, T and B cells. Now it’s every three months. They are doing vaccine-related research, too. I was vaccinated with Pfizer on March 1 and 22. They have 150 people enrolled; not everyone was hospitalized. They are trying to figure out if you had Covid, if you need both shots. It’s nice to contribute. They saved my life. The least I can do is help with their research.\nWhat made you leave the city?\nMy near-death experience caused me to see New York in a different light. It caused us to hit a reset button. Zach and I had long talked about the suburbs. Both our parents live out here, and they help so much with our son. Moving gave me something to focus on other than just my illness.\nNow we have three times as much space. When someone asked my son what his favorite room was in our old apartment he would say the hallway outside our door because that’s where he could run up and down. Now he has a front and back yard, which is great.\nWhy did you switch jobs? What other changes have you made?\nAs a writer, I’m in control. I feel a greater sense of connection, which I didn’t have in my old job. It’s not as lucrative, but it’s more personally satisfying. If there’s something you want to do, go do it.\nI’ve gone back to church. When I got sick, my mother prayed for me constantly. I received an outpouring of support and prayer from others I didn’t know. And I survived. When I got better, she said, all these people reached out to you, you need to pay it forward. People ask me to pray for them, so I am. I try to pray every day.\nPositivity rates are rising again because of the Delta variant. Does this worry you?\nI’m anxious, but mostly conflicted. We are all very confused. I’m worried about a return to the sickness and death we saw last year. And I’m concerned about the harm that lockdown can do on people’s lives and jobs.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/nyregion/david-lat-coronavirus-nyc.html"}
