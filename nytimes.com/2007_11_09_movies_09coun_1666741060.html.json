You hear the creak of floorboards and the beeping of a transponder, and see the shadows of the hunter’s feet in the sliver of light under the door. The footsteps move away, and the next sound is the faint squeak of the light bulb in the hall being unscrewed. The silence and the slowness awaken your senses and quiet your breathing, as by the simplest cinematic means — Look! Listen! Hush! — your attention is completely and ecstatically absorbed. You won’t believe what happens next, even though you know it’s coming.\nThe Essential Cormac McCarthy Card 1 of 5 ‘Blood Meridian’ (1985). Loosely based on historical events, the novel follows a fictional 14-year-old referred to only as “the kid” as he drifts through the Southwest. “‘Blood Meridian’ makes it clear that all along Mr. McCarthy has asked us to witness evil not in order to understand it but to affirm its inexplicable reality,” Caryn James wrote in her review for The Times. ‘All the Pretty Horses’ (1992). This best-selling book is an adventure story about a Texan boy who rides off with his buddy to Mexico. “The magnetic attraction of Mr. McCarthy's fiction comes first from the extraordinary quality of his prose,” Madison Smartt Bell wrote in his review. ‘The Crossing’ (1994). The novel begins on a small cattle ranch in New Mexico in the last years of the Depression and follows Billy Parham, a teenage cowboy as he repeatedly crosses the border with Mexico. “‘The Crossing’ is a miracle in prose, an American original,” Robert Hass wrote in his review. ‘No Country for Old Men’ (2005). This fast, violent story centers on a stone-cold killer, a small-town sheriff and an average Joe who stumbles across a leather case filled with more than $2 million. “‘No Country for Old Men’ is as bracing a variation on these noir orthodoxies as any fan of the genre could expect,” Walter Kirn wrote in his review. ‘The Road’ (2006). The book is a despairing account of a boy and his father lurching across the cold, wretched, corpse-strewn, ashen landscape of a post-apocalyptic world. “Mr. McCarthy has summoned his fiercest visions to invoke the devastation. He gives voice to the unspeakable in a terse cautionary tale that is too potent to be numbing,” Janet Maslin wrote in her review.\nBy the time this moment arrives, though, you have already been pulled into a seamlessly imagined and self-sufficient reality. The Coens have always used familiar elements of American pop culture and features of particular American landscapes to create elaborate and hermetic worlds. Mr. McCarthy, especially in the western phase of his career, has frequently done the same. The surprise of “No Country for Old Men,” the first literary adaptation these filmmakers have attempted, is how well matched their methods turn out to be with the novelist’s.\nMr. McCarthy’s book, for all its usual high-literary trappings (many philosophical digressions, no quotation marks), is one of his pulpier efforts, as well as one of his funniest. The Coens, seizing on the novel’s genre elements, lower the metaphysical temperature and amplify the material’s dark, rueful humor. It helps that the three lead actors — Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin along with Mr. Bardem — are adept at displaying their natural wit even when their characters find themselves in serious trouble.\nThe three are locked in a swerving, round-robin chase that takes them through the empty ranges and lonely motels of the West Texas border country in 1980. The three men occupy the screen one at a time, almost never appearing in the frame together, even as their fates become ever more intimately entwined.\nMr. Jones plays Ed Tom Bell, a world weary third-generation sheriff whose stoicism can barely mask his dismay at the tide of evil seeping into the world. Whether Chigurh is a magnetic force moving that tide or just a particularly nasty specimen carried in on it is one of the questions the film occasionally poses. The man who knows him best, a dandyish bounty-hunter played by Woody Harrelson, describes Chigurh as lacking a sense of humor. But the smile that rides up one side of Chigurh’s mouth as he speaks suggests a diabolical kind of mirth — just as the haircut suggests a lost Beatle from hell — and his conversation has a teasing, riddling quality. The punch line comes when he blows a hole in your head with the pneumatic device he prefers to a conventional firearm.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/movies/09coun.html"}
