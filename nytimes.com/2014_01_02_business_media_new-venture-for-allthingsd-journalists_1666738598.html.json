Mossberg and Kara Swisher, founders of the conference and news business All Things Digital, are expected to start their new venture, ReCode, on Thursday.\nReCode will have backing from two minority investors, Windsor Media, an investment firm run by the former Yahoo chief executive Terry S. Semel, and NBCUniversal News Group.\nThe business will closely resemble AllThingsD, the website and conference brand that Mr. Mossberg and Ms. Swisher — both prominent technology industry journalists — ran as part of News Corporation. Ties to the media giant were cut last year.\n“This was the best way to grow this in the way we thought it should grow,” said Mr. Mossberg, who along with Ms. Swisher weighed deals with other media companies.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/business/media/new-venture-for-allthingsd-journalists.html"}
