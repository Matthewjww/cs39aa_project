Google’s cars primarily use a laser system known as Lidar (light detection and ranging), a spinning range-finding unit on top of the car that creates a detailed map of the car’s surroundings as it moves.Lidar is also used on many of the experimental autonomous vehicles being developed by Nissan, BMW, Apple and others, but not by Tesla. Some experts speculate that a Lidar-driven car might have avoided this fatal crash.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/01/business/inside-tesla-accident.html"}
