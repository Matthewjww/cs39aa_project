This year, they got part of what they wished for — but in a way they would have preferred not to.\nA fire that knocked out one of the plant’s two reactors on Saturday caused oil and fire-retardant foam to spill from it and into the Hudson, putting the reactor out of commission for several weeks. On the bright side, millions of fish and insect larvae are less likely to be sucked into the plant along with the billions of gallons of river water it uses to cool the two reactors. However, a large swath of the surface of that habitat remained coated in an oily slick on Tuesday.\nA spreading sheen was reportedly visible as far upriver as the Bear Mountain Bridge and as far south as Haverstraw, N.Y. — well beyond the floating, yellow booms set up around the plant, which is in northern Westchester County, about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.\nThe possibility that the episode at Indian Point on Saturday caused significant harm to the environment fueled the opposition from several of the plant’s critics, including officials from the environmental group Riverkeeper and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has pressed for a permanent shutdown of Indian Point, and appeared there on Saturday night and again on Sunday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/nyregion/fire-prompts-renewed-calls-to-close-the-indian-point-nuclear-plant.html"}
