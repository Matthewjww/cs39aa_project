Z. Sakall—give a little bounce now and again to a leaden script in \"My Dream Is Yours.\" Doris Day fills the sound track with songs—fast ones, slow ones, noisy ones and syrupy ones—but they are routine melodies for the most part. And Lee Bowman sings some dreamy, toneless things which also tend to string out the new film in Technicolor on the Strand's screen for better than ninety minutes.The only bit of novelty in this hackneyed reworking of the how-tough-it-is-to-get-a-break-in-show-business theme is the introduction of a cartoon fantasy sequence representing a child's dream of the Easter bunny. However, even this interlude is more seasonally appropriate than imaginative and it doesn't last long enough to divert attention from the sad fact that \"My Dream Is Yours\" is a dull show.Four writers labored over the script which finds the affable Mr. Carson desperately striving on borrowed money—Miss Arden's, naturally—to get a break in the big time for his new singing sensation, Miss Day. Disappointment meets his every effort, but after a while it becomes quite clear that if the picture can continue long enough Miss Day will indeed be a sensation. She just has to get that break, for she's blonde and beautiful, and a war widow with a cute little son. Besides, isn't Carson just about the best talent huckster in the radio advertising business? And doesn't he deserve to get even with an egotistical swoon king (Lee Bowman), who decides to walk out on a contract?Everything comes to pass with deadly precision in \"My Dream Is Yours.\" And, although Director Michael Curtiz moves his camera freely about Hollywood to reflect the atmosphere of the fabulous sun flooded town, there is little semblance of real movement about this picture.Lionel Hampton and his orchestra are featured on the stage of the Strand along with Mantan Moreland and Kitty Murray.\nAt the Strand\nMY DREAM IS YOURS, screen play by Harry Kurnitz and Dane Lussier; adaptation by Allan Rivkin and Laura Kerr; directed by Michael Curtiz; a Michael Curtiz production for Warner Brothers.Doug Blake . . . . .
