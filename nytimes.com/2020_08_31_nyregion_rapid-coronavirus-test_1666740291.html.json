Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have blamed large national laboratories for a backlog in processing test results. While smaller labs can often produce results faster, there are not enough of them to handle tests on a citywide scale.\nSince last month, the median wait time for coronavirus test results had gone up in New York City, from two days to three, a change that the city’s Health Department has attributed primarily to slow processing by Quest Diagnostics laboratories. The city this month opened several “express” testing sites, promising results in 24 hours. (City officials said by the end of the month, the median was back down to two days.)\nSome of the fastest turnaround times have been seen in hospital-based testing, especially samples from patients who are having surgery. For patients in the emergency room or admitted to the hospital, most results come back within a day, city officials said.\nBut for many others, the timeline is much less predictable.\nDuring one week in early August, a quarter of all test results in New York City came back in more than 13 days, according to the Health Department. About a third of the tests were handled by Quest, the department said.\nQuest, which can process some 150,000 coronavirus tests a day, has said recently that its turnaround times have improved. The company said in a statement on Tuesday that its average testing turnaround had been reduced to two days.\nFor those with an exacting clientele, there has been competition to establish relationships with smaller labs.\n“When we started, we had a regular lab, Quest, and we were getting results back in seven days, which is worthless,” said Dr. Matthew Priddy, who runs a concierge medical practice in Indianapolis.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/nyregion/rapid-coronavirus-test.html"}
