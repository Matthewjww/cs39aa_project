Gasoline-powered cars in the top range are the Toyota Starlet, at 44 miles, and the Honda coupe. American Cars Improved\nThe ratings show that American- made cars are nearly twice as fuel-efficient as they were at the time of the Arab oil embargo a decade ago.\nIn announcing the figures, the agency offered consumers a warning that the estimates ''do not predict the actual mileage that will be obtained,'' adding, ''Instead, the agency's Fuel Economy Guide provides a way to compare the relative fuel economy performances of different new models driven under the same test conditions.''\n''When the mileage estimates were first published in 1974, domestic cars averaged 13.2 miles per gallon,'' the agency said. ''The average projected for 1984 domestic models is 25.6 miles, or 94 percent higher than that average 10 years ago.'' 26.9 Mile a Gallon Average\nThe average for all 1984 foreign and domestic cars is 26.9 miles per gallon, an improvement of 89 percent as against the 1974 level of 14.2 miles.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/us/japanese-auto-leads-fuel-efficiency-ratings.html"}
