Some of the others who attended were Princeton University classmates of Mr. Cooper, some wearing orange-and-black ties emblazoned with the school mascot, a tiger. Mr. Cooper graduated last year.\nMr. Cooper jumped from a ledge of Miss Vanderbilt's Gracie Square apartment on the Upper East Side last Friday after she tried to talk him out of it, the police said.
