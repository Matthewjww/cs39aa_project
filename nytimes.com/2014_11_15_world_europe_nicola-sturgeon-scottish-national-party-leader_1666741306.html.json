She will replace Alex Salmond, who announced his resignation as party leader and first minister of Scotland, the head of government, after Scots voted “no” on independence.\nThe party holds a majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, and Ms. Sturgeon is expected to be formally elected first minister next week. Known as a tough and effective politician, Ms. Sturgeon studied at Glasgow University and worked as a lawyer before being elected to the Scottish Parliament at the age of 29 in 1999.\nAfter her long apprenticeship as deputy, Ms. Sturgeon had no rival for the leadership and takes over a buoyant party.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/world/europe/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-national-party-leader.html"}
