Read about others here.\nJoel Revzen, a conductor who thrived in regional opera and music festivals, but whose career also took him to the Metropolitan Opera and the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Russia, died on May 25 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 74.\nThe cause was Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, his wife, Cynthia Rhys, said.\nCritics often noted Mr. Revzen’s clarity and instinct for shaping drama in music. One review in The Washington Post described him as “a graceful and intelligent conductor who pays attention to the smallest details,” adding, “He is also a fine musician and adept at focusing listener’s attention on the individual voices of his orchestra so that they are lovingly underscored.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/obituaries/joel-revzen-dead-coronavirus.html"}
