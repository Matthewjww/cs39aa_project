Humanitarian groups estimate that nearly 500 people have already died at sea this year, compared with about 50 in the same period last year.\n“We are experiencing a trend similar to last year,” said Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman in Italy for the International Organization for Migration. “It is an emergency from a humanitarian point of view. These people are risking their lives, and many people are losing their lives at sea. It is also an operational emergency.”\nFor years, migrants have paid smugglers to deliver them to Europe via the Mediterranean, with the numbers spiking during the summer, when the sea is calmer. But unrest in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, along with war and poverty in some African countries, has transformed migration into a year-round phenomenon with increased risks for calamity.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/14/world/europe/influx-of-migrants-across-mediterranean-nears-record-levels.html"}
