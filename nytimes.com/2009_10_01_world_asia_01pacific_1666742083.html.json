Indonesian television stations showed images of flattened hospitals, hotels and houses, burning cars and terrified residents running in the center of the city. Power and telecommunications were cut, complicating rescue efforts when night fell.\nA second earthquake struck western Indonesia on Thursday morning more than 100 miles from the epicenter of the quake on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. There were no immediate reports of damage.\nEarly on Tuesday in the Samoas, an underwater 8.0 magnitude quake produced a tsunami that struck with little warning after dawn, causing at least 103 deaths and 145 injuries, destroying villages throughout the islands. “It is the worst one we have had,” said Lilo Malava, the police commissioner of Samoa, in a telephone interview.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/world/asia/01pacific.html"}
