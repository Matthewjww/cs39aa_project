The council has accused Mr. Hadi’s subordinates of corruption and incompetence, and has advocated the revival of a separate state in southern Yemen, which merged with the north in 1990.\nLast week, the council gave Mr. Hadi an ultimatum to dismiss the cabinet, and as the deadline neared, the forces of the two sides started shooting at each other on Sunday with tanks, artillery and automatic weapons.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/world/middleeast/yemen-war.html"}
