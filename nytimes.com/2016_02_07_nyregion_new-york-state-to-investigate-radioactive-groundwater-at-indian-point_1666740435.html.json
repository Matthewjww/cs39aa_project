Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday.\nThe governor said water contaminated with tritium had leaked into the groundwater at the plant, causing “alarming levels” of radioactivity to be found at three out of the 40 monitoring wells on the site.\nOne of the wells reported a 65,000 percent increase in the water’s level of radioactivity, Mr. Cuomo said, citing a report by Entergy Corporation, which owns the plant.\nMr. Cuomo said the contamination appeared to be limited to the groundwater beneath the plant in Buchanan, N.Y., about 30 miles north of New York City in Westchester County. He nevertheless expressed his alarm, adding, “This latest failure at Indian Point is unacceptable.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/nyregion/new-york-state-to-investigate-radioactive-groundwater-at-indian-point.html"}
