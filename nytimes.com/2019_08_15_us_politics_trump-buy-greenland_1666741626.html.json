At a meeting that spring in the Oval Office, he joked about buying Greenland for its resources, according to a person who was in attendance.\nIn the year since, the president has repeatedly returned to the topic, asking aides if they can pursue a purchase of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory that Mr. Trump has been taken with in part because of its natural resources, like coal and uranium.\nPrivately, Mr. Trumpâ€™s advisers are highly skeptical that such a move could ever happen. But instead of telling him they do not think it is possible, the advisers have agreed to investigate the matter, according to the people briefed on the discussions.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/us/politics/trump-buy-greenland.html"}
