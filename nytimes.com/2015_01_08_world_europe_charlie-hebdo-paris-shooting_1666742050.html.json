The killers escaped, traumatizing the city and sending shock waves through Europe and beyond.\nOfficials said late Wednesday that two of the suspects were brothers. They were identified as Said and Chérif Kouachi, 34 and 32. The third suspect is Hamyd Mourad, 18. News reports said the brothers, known to intelligence services, had been born in Paris, raising the prospect that homegrown Muslim extremists were responsible.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/charlie-hebdo-paris-shooting.html"}
