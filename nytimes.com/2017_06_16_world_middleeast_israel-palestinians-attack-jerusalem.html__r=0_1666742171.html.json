She was stabbed several times as she fought her attacker, the police said. She was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition and was pronounced dead two hours later.\nSeveral other police officers and passers-by were moderately or lightly injured, according to initial reports by the police and emergency services. The three assailants were shot and killed at the scene of the attacks, which occurred almost simultaneously and a short distance apart.\nThe Islamic State took responsibility for the attacks, a claim that could not be confirmed independently.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-attack-jerusalem.html?_r=0"}
