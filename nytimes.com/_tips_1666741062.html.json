Documentation or evidence is essential. Speculating or having a hunch does not rise to the level of a tip. A good news tip should articulate a clear and understandable issue or problem with real-world consequences. Be specific. Finally, a news tip should be newsworthy. While we agree it is unfair that your neighbor is stealing cable, we would not write a story about it.\nExamples of good tips include:\nHere is evidence that this government representative is breaking the law.\nHere is proof that this company is conducting itself unethically.\nWe will be reviewing messages regularly, but cannot promise each will receive an individual response. There are multiple ways to submit tips. Each method provides different levels of protection, so we encourage you to be certain of the pros and cons of the method you choose. We will respond to tips using the same method in which they were submitted. For example, if you submit a tip to us with Signal, we will only respond to you using Signal.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/tips"}
