Still, as of Thursday afternoon, he remained missing.\nThe search has been complicated by the fact that Avonte has a severe form of autism, unable to verbally communicate and unable to care for himself.\nWhatever Avonte was thinking as he left the Riverview School, at 1-50 51st Avenue, last Friday would have remained locked inside his own mind, even if he had come across someone looking to help.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/11/nyregion/search-continues-for-autistic-boy-who-walked-out-of-his-school.html"}
