The government also lifted a requirement to show proof of vaccination to enter most enclosed spaces, including airplanes.\nBut travelers applying to enter the country to observe the hajj will still be required to show proof that they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the ministry said.\nIn relaxing its restrictions, the Interior Ministry cited the countryâ€™s high vaccination rate.\nBefore the pandemic, millions of Muslim worshipers typically visited the holy sites in Saudi Arabia each year to observe hajj and Umrah, generating billions of dollars in revenue. The pandemic prompted the kingdom, which imposed strict Covid measures, in effect to cancel hajj in 2020. Last year it allowed only 60,000 pilgrims living in Saudi Arabia to observe the rituals.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-covid-hajj-pilgrims.html"}
