That figure is on the low end of the revenue estimate the company shared publicly with investors in February.\nEven that revenue is coming at a cost, with Yahoo expecting to pay other sites about $1 billion this year for sending traffic to its advertising services.\nThe company’s cash flow is also declining. Yahoo has reaffirmed to bidders its February projection that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would be about $750 million this year, down from $952 million in 2015.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/technology/yahoo-paints-grim-financial-picture-as-deadline-for-bids-nears.html"}
