The police were trying to evict about 150 farmers from the reserve, which is part of a huge estate owned by Blas Riquelme, a politician opposed to President Fernando Lugo. Seven police officers and 10 farmers have been killed in the forest, about 150 miles north of the capital, Asunci√≥n. Advocates for poor farmers say the land, acquired from the state decades ago by Mr. Riquelme, should have been part of a land reform program. Mr. Lugo won an election in 2008 in part on a promise of agrarian reform that would benefit 87,000 Paraguayan farm families, though as he nears the end of his term he has yet to deliver.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/world/americas/paraguay-army-to-intervene-in-dispute-over-land.html"}
