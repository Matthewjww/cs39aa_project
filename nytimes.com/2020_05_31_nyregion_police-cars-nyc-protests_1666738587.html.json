After failing to turn over the vehicle, protesters set it on fire by burning their signs inside it, he said.\nSoon, images and videos of the vehicle, with windows broken and engulfed in red flames, spread across social media during the first night of protests in New York City following the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died on May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer pinned him down by his neck for several minutes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/nyregion/police-cars-nyc-protests.html"}
