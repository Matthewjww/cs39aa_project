They were suspended from the team indefinitely.\n“They will have to earn their way back,” Coach Steve Alford said of LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill.\nThe players, who returned to the United States on Tuesday after President Trump interceded with President Xi Jinping of China, apologized for their actions at a news conference.\nBall, the highest-profile player involved, said: “I’d like to start off by saying sorry for stealing from the stores in China. I’m a young man, but it’s not an excuse for making a really stupid decision.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/sports/ucla-liangelo-ball-suspended.html"}
