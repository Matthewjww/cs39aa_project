The original intent behind including Puerto Rico in the draft was that it was the initial step toward such a draft. Because Puerto Rico is an American commonwealth, it was the obvious place to begin.\nThe expansion of the draft has not taken place, but the major leagues may be drifting in that direction. The new collective bargaining agreement, signed in November, establishes limits on the amount clubs can spend in a country. In addition, Melendez said, a committee has been created to explore putting an international draft in place.\n“You may see one in a year or two — in 2013 or 2014,” he said.\nMeanwhile, baseball officials in Puerto Rico are watching the sport deteriorate. Bernier, Puerto Rico’s former secretary of sport, said that the number of children who play baseball had not declined but that the diminished winter league and the relative dearth of Puerto Ricans in the major leagues were causes for concern.\n“I think M.L.B. recognizes the problem, and they have every right to include us in the draft,” Bernier said. “It’s their decision, and we have to try to adjust accordingly. But with the way things are, Puerto Ricans are slowly becoming less enthusiastic about baseball, and that can become a vicious cycle.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/sports/baseball/puerto-rico-traces-decline-in-prospects-to-inclusion-in-the-baseball-draft.html"}
