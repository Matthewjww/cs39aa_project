Jim Justice said on Monday.\nThere are roughly 380,000 West Virginians in that age group, many of whom have already gotten at least one shot, but Mr. Justice said he hoped the money would motivate the rest to get inoculated, as “they’re not taking the vaccines as fast as we’d like them to take them.”\nThe state will use federal funds from the CARES Act to pay for the bonds, Mr. Justice, a Republican, said at a news conference, adding that he had “vetted this every way that we possibly can” to ensure that the unconventional use of the funds was allowed.\nThe bonds will be also be available to anyone in that age group who has already been vaccinated, Mr. Justice said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/world/west-virginia-vaccine-savings-bonds.html"}
