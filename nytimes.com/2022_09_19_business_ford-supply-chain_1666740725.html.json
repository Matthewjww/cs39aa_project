Industry executives had expected the squeeze to ease in the second half of this year but Ford’s warning indicates that the supply chain chaos is continuing to hurt car companies and could drag into 2023.\nFord said it expected to end the third quarter with 40,000 to 45,000 mostly completed vehicles that cannot be shipped to dealers because they are missing certain components. That’s higher than the company had expected. In July, about 53,000 vehicles were not completed.\nThe automaker warned that a large portion of the uncompleted models include high-margin trucks and sport-utility vehicles that generate a significant share of Ford’s profit.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/19/business/ford-supply-chain.html"}
