It was the first time he had won starting below fourth and only the second time in Red Bull’s 338-race history it had won from below the top six.\n“Of course, it’s a great lead,” Verstappen said. “But we cannot have too many days as we had in qualifying,” when his car had a problem with the power unit.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/sports/autoracing/max-verstappen-formula-1.html"}
