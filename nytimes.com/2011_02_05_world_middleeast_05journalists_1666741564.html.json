He died from his wounds on Friday.\nThe new attacks on journalists did not appear as widespread on Friday as they were a day before, when a coordinated campaign of media intimidation hit its peak. But several newsrooms were forced to shut down and, in the case of Al Jazeera Arabic’s Cairo office, set on fire.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/world/middleeast/05journalists.html"}
