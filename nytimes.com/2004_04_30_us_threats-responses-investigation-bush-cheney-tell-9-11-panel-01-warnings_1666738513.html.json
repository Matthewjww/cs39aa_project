''There were no surprises,'' said the panel's chairman, Thomas H. Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey, who was named to the position by Mr. Bush. ''There was information that we did not have. But it was not information that was a surprise.''\nHe said in an interview that the questioning was ''very sharp but very fair -- by sharp, I mean in the sense of intellectually sharp.'' He continued: ''We learned things we did not know about the events of the day of 9/11 and, very importantly, the president gave us real insights into his thinking.''\nMr. Kean said that despite speculation among Congressional Democrats and other critics that Mr. Cheney might try to dominate the session, ''the opposite was true'' and the president had handled nearly three-quarters of the questions raised by the commissioners. If the public had been allowed to witness the meeting, he said, ''I think they would have had a lot more confidence in our government.''\nAnother of the panel's Republicans, John F. Lehman, Navy secretary in the Reagan administration, said Mr. Bush had answered the panel's questions with little hesitation or need for assistance from Mr. Cheney or Alberto R. Gonzales, the White House counsel, who attended the session along with two other White House lawyers.\nHe said Mr. Gonzales had said little. ''He chimed in on some questions where he was able to clarify some dates and facts,'' Mr. Lehman said. ''The questioning of the president did not pull any punches. It was very direct. And the president was equally sharp but polite in responding.''\nA Democrat on the panel, Bob Kerrey, a former senator from Nebraska who is now president of the New School in New York, said he had also been impressed by the president. ''He answered directly and completely and in a very cordial and respectful way,'' Mr. Kerrey said, adding that the session would ''improve the quality of our report.''", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/30/us/threats-responses-investigation-bush-cheney-tell-9-11-panel-01-warnings.html"}
