Treasury yields were universally expected to be rising, not falling, as the United States recovered from a deep recession. The domestic economy is, in fact, growing, and corporate profits have been rising, but the European crisis has overturned many expectations.\nImage The Parthenon, top, in Athens and the Treasury in Washington. As Greece’s debt woes have led stocks to crumble, many investors still see relative strength in Treasury bond funds. Credit... Orestis Panagiotou/European Pressphoto Agency; Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News\nBarry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays Capital, got some of the outlines right, if not the details. “Sometimes, you’re correct for other reasons,” he said. He had predicted that after a long run upward, the stock market would fall in the first half of the year, and it has, putting stocks in “correction” territory. So far, so good.\nBut Mr. Knapp had thought that the stock market decline would be set off by a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which has operated on an emergency basis since the onset of the financial crisis in the United States. The Fed hasn’t tightened. Instead, to keep the economy stable in the face of Europe’s problems, it has held short-term interest rates near zero. In addition, it reopened emergency swap lines with European central banks last month, to help maintain liquidity there.\nSimilarly, Joseph H. Davis, Vanguard’s chief economist, had said it was likely that long-term interest rates would be rising and that the Fed would be moving short-term rates up more dramatically. That will still happen eventually, he said, but the timing is far from certain. “We got it wrong,” he said cheerfully. “Of course, we did warn that there was a good chance that might happen.”\nIn a detailed 16-page analysis of the bond market in March, Mr. Davis and several Vanguard associates deconstructed Treasury yields and projected rates using the “forward yield curve,” a standard calculation of the market’s assessment of future interest rate levels. This kind of analysis makes use of the information embedded in prices, but it won’t tell you what will happen to the bond and stock markets if something unexpected arises  like Greece suddenly running into a credit wall.\nWhat comfort can be drawn from these uncertain markets?\nFirst, the Vanguard study found that even a climb in Treasury yields needn’t be devastating for well-run long-term bond portfolios, because higher yields can more than compensate for lower bond prices. Such management may not be easy to do on your own, but the study found that many mutual funds have handled the transition well in past market cycles.\nSecond, at the moment, investment-grade bonds are very richly priced in comparison with stocks, several analysts said. Mr. Knapp says he expects that the S.& P. 500 will rise to 1,210 by the end of the year, or 13.6 percent from its current 1,064.88, and that the chances for strong longer-term stock returns are favorable. (The outlook for Treasuries is not positive, he said.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/business/06stra.html"}
