It also commits to keeping the tournament in its current format, in which 68 teams compete through six rounds (plus the four so-called play-in games before the tournament begins in earnest).\nThe new deal, which will, like its predecessor, provide the N.C.A.A. with a vast majority of its annual revenue, comes at a time when many college athletes and their advocates have sought a greater share of such windfalls than the amateur status of athletes permits. The N.C.A.A. and several of its member conferences have relented somewhat: The dollar amounts of full scholarships have been raised, and the N.C.A.A. recently disbursed $200 million to help colleges cope with rising costs.\nIn an interview Tuesday, the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, said that since the contract was critical to the finances of more than a thousand athletic departments across three divisions it made sense to agree early to a contract extension with pre-existing broadcast partners.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-extends-basketball-deal-with-cbs-sports-and-turner-through-2032.html"}
