Instead they may be called to testify by the defense.\nMr. Weinstein’s lawyers have made it clear one of their strategies will be to put the police officers who investigated Mr. Weinstein on trial, raising recent allegations of misconduct in the Special Victims Division to undermine the case against their client, a once-powerful filmmaker who is one of the most prominent figures to be brought down in the #MeToo movement.\nLast month, Mr. Weinstein’s team signaled it would seek to subpoena the New York City police sergeant who led a 10-month investigation of Mr. Weinstein and, according to two people familiar with the matter, has been accused of accepting a gift from the lawyer for one of his accusers.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/nyregion/weinstein-trial-police-investigation.html"}
