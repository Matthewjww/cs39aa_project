An Opel official said the production shortfall was costing about $22 million a day.\nFord Turns to Other Plants\nOfficials at Ford Werke, Ford's West German unit, say the company has thus far been able to keep its German plants running by drawing on parts from its factories in other European countries. But officials said the auto maker would be forced by dwindling parts supplies to close plants in Germany and Belgium next Wednesday if the strike continued.\nVolkswagen, Germany's biggest auto maker, said on Tuesday that it was closing six factories in Germany and one in Belgium, effective today, halting production of about 5,000 cars a day. Two factories of VW's Audi subsidiary in Germany have been shut down since May 18.\nEvidently to play down the effects of the strike, a VW official said that most of the company's 110,000 workers had been sent on a one-week enforced vacation. But he acknowledged that only about half of the employees would resume work when plants reopen next Monday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/31/business/german-strike-slowing-european-auto-output.html"}
