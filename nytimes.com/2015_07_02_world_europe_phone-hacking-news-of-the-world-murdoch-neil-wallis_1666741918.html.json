But Mr. Wallis denied involvement, and a jury at the Old Bailey found him not guilty.\nMr. Wallis, 64, said that case had “ruined my life,” and accused prosecutors of a “vicious, politically driven campaign against the press.”\nOutrage over revelations that journalists were illegally gaining access to private voice mail accounts prompted Rupert Murdoch to close down The News of the World in July 2011. In all, eight of the paper’s reporters and a private investigator have been convicted of related charges.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/world/europe/phone-hacking-news-of-the-world-murdoch-neil-wallis.html"}
