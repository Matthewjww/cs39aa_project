But he called it a defensive program, not an offensive one.\n“As a matter of course when we go into an opposing stadium, an in our home stadium, we look around to make sure there’s nothing suspicious going on,” Luhnow said. “We do it in every stadium we go into. We’re going to continue to have our eyes open.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/sports/astros-red-sox-dugout.html"}
