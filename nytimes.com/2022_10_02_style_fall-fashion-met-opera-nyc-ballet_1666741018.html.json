The Metropolitan Opera held its opening night gala on Tuesday for “Medea,” with a notably more diverse cross-section of the city’s philanthropic, arts and social circles. The venerable affair, which raised $4.8 million, also pushed the boundaries of what constitutes black tie, with some men ascending the grand staircase in heels and dresses.\nThe sartorial shift continued the next night at the New York City Ballet’s Fall Fashion Gala at Lincoln Center. Traditional fishtail gowns shared the red carpet with men in crop tops and flowing tutus. The gala, which pairs choreography with fashion, raised $3.4 million and honored Sarah Jessica Parker. It also featured an original score by Solange Knowles.\nAnd in London, the private club Annabel’s held its annual charity for the Amazon rainforest on Sept. 22, with proceeds benefiting the Caring Family Foundation. The splashy affair drew society figures, actors and models, who took the “black tie elevated with Amazon colors” dress code to heart.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/02/style/fall-fashion-met-opera-nyc-ballet.html"}
