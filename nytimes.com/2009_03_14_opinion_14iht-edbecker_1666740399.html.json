There are warnings of humanitarian crises and dire consequences for Darfur. History suggests, however, that postponing justice could be even worse.\nA case in point is Cambodia, where Khmer Rouge leaders are finally being tried 30 years after they were overthrown. (That is the equivalent of waiting until 1975 to try the Nazis.) Cambodia is the classic example of what happens when the international community puts off the hard work of justice in the name of realpolitik.\nTrials for Pol Pot and other Khmer Rouge leaders were delayed for all the reasons that are being used today for Sudan. A trial would be impractical while war was still raging; a trial would disrupt the peace process; a trial would upset a hard-won equilibrium and reopen old wounds.\nPol Pot and his comrades were among the worst monsters of the 20th century. But they knew how to work the system, especially in defeat.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/opinion/14iht-edbecker.html"}
