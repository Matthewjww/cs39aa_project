The human brain is still better than any computer at making decisions in the face of sudden, unforeseen events on the road – a child running into the street, a swerving cyclist or a fallen tree limb.\nHere are five situations that, for now at least, often confound self-driving cars and the engineers working on them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/06/automobiles/autonomous-cars-problems.html"}
