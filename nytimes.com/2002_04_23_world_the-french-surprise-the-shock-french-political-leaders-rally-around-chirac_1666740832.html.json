It has been quick in recent years to hand out moral lessons to other European nations, like Austria, that have voted heavily for rightist candidates, making its sense of humiliation today that much harder to bear.\nLe Monde published a column entitled simply ''The Wound.'' Written by its publisher, Jean-Marie Colombani, it said: ''France is wounded. And, for many of the French, humiliated.''\nHigh school students marched out of classrooms in Lyon, Strasbourg, Reims, Rouen, Angers and Besan√ßon to hold rallies against Mr. Le Pen, chanting slogans equating him with Hitler and calling his National Front a fascist organization. Tonight, police officers fired tear gas at anti-Le Pen protesters throwing homemade gasoline bombs in central Paris.\nAbsolute strangers debated the results in the subways and around newspaper kiosks, stunned that the Socialist Party, which had governed the country for nearly five years, had been eliminated from the presidential race for the first time in decades.\nMr. Le Pen's supporters pledged today to hold a rally on May 1. Unimpressed by the breadth of the opposition lining up against him and snap polls that showed Jacques Chirac, the center-right president, likely to win by a landslide, Mr. Le Pen, 73, went to his Paris headquarters today, cheerfully telling reporters that he was just getting started.\nHe called on voters who abstained in the first round to vote for him on May 5. ''The people of France have decided to use their power to shake up the current system,'' Mr. Le Pen said. ''If you are disheartened, you have the chance to say what you think by voting for me, with your head high and hands clean.\nBruno Jeanbart, a director at the C.S.A. polling institute, said there was a certain logic to the result because the French did not want to see another race between Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin, the Socialist leader, who have ruled for seven and five years respectively as president and prime minister. The two men contested the final round of the 1995 presidential election.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/23/world/the-french-surprise-the-shock-french-political-leaders-rally-around-chirac.html"}
