We’re willing to sell our souls to get a foot in China, and it’s a mistake.” A woman behind me whispered to her companion: “But isn’t that just what he’s done?”\nBehind the scenes, a group of Oxford citizens began looking into the international program. “I don’t think the community objects to having foreign students here,” says Kallie Roesner-Meyers, a horse-stable owner who started the group, known as Team 20. “But there was so much secrecy and misinformation around the whole China setup that we needed to find out more.” In the spring of 2015, Team 20, which sent the district a flurry of Freedom of Information Act requests, discovered, among other things, that the school board had agreed to a 20-year deal based on Skilling’s recommendation.\nIn response to communication from Roesner-Meyers, federal agents questioned Skilling about his consulting work for Weiming. (Skilling says he ceased consulting before the Oxford deal went through.) One of them also wanted to know more about the visa maneuver by which Chinese students were staying for two years instead of one. According to Skilling, the agents said they “didn’t see any issue,” and he told a reporter that Roesner-Meyers “needs to settle down.” But the pressure only persisted. Skilling retired later that year, and Weiming, without giving any explanation, put the dorm project on hold.\nWeiming still has roughly 100 of its students at Oxford. And with thousands more students in its Chinese schools expecting to come to the United States, the search for a flagship location continues. In 2015, the company bid $12.6 million for a 58-acre property in West Hartford, Conn. It proposed to turn the former University of Connecticut site into an international school for 500 students, some of whom would feed into the city’s public high schools. Local officials supported the plan, but last May the City Council, responding to vocal opposition to a little-known Chinese company taking control of land in the city center, voted against it.\nHovering in the background of the West Hartford debate was the suspension of the Weiming dorm in Oxford — and the government’s unresolved investigation into its international program. By November, the Department of Homeland Security offered a verdict. The visa maneuver would not be permitted in the future, a blow to the model Oxford pioneered.\nOxford has not been punished, but it will no longer be allowed to keep Chinese students for more than one year on its campus. The current crop of 41 second-year Chinese students has been allowed to stay, though they must now take all of their classes at Rochester College, the institution that sponsors their visas, instead of Oxford High School. In June, after a semester of isolation, these kids will even earn their high-school diplomas. The future of the first-year students is up in the air. They may not be able to graduate from Oxford next year, and it is too late to re-enter China’s gaokao system. So they and their families may be back on the international-student carousel, scrambling to find another school to attend next year.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/magazine/the-parachute-generation.html"}
