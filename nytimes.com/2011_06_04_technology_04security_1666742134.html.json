RSA officials said Friday that they accepted Lockheed’s findings and were working with customers to offset the risks through other measures.\nRSA disclosed in March that hackers had stolen data that could compromise a company’s SecurID system in a broader attack, and the breach of Lockheed, the nation’s largest defense contractor, is the first time that is known to have occurred.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/04/technology/04security.html"}
