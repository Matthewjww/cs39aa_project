This month, it delivered its verdict: denied.\nThe Facebook team was not surprised. It wasn’t the first time Apple had said no to the Facebook Gaming app. Or the second. Or even the third.\nSince February, Apple has rejected at least five versions of Facebook Gaming, according to three people with knowledge of the companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Each time, the people said, Apple cited its rules that prohibit apps with the “main purpose” of distributing casual games.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/technology/apple-ios-facebook-gaming-app.html"}
