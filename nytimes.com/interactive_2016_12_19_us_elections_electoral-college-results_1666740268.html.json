Powell Washington Clinton Colin L. Powell Washington Clinton Colin L. Powell Washington Clinton Faith Spotted Eagle\nIn Washington, a state where Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had strong support in the Democratic primary against Hillary Clinton, three of the state’s 12 electoral votes went to Colin L. Powell, the Republican former secretary of state. One more elector voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American leader. Another Democratic elector in Hawaii voted for Mr. Sanders.\nTwo Texas electors voted for different Republican politicians: Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and former Texas congressman Ron Paul.\nIn addition, three Democratic electors, in Colorado, Maine and Minnesota, initially declined to vote for Mrs. Clinton. Two were replaced by an alternate, and one ended up changing his vote.\nProtest Votes in the Electoral College\nElectors are not required by the Constitution to vote for a particular candidate. Some states and parties require their electors to pledge to vote for a candidate and may fine or replace electors who break their pledge.\nIt is rare for more than one elector to vote against the party’s pledged candidate, but it has happened on a few occasions.\nIn 1808, six New York electors from the Democratic-Republican Party refused to vote for James Madison and instead voted for the party’s vice-presidential candidate, George Clinton.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/19/us/elections/electoral-college-results.html"}
