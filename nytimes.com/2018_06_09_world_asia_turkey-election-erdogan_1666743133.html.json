But the election, as with a referendum last year that created a more powerful presidential system, is turning into a vote for or against his continued rule.\nThe front-runner among the opposition candidates is Muharrem Ince, a physics teacher and five-time member of Parliament for the Republican People’s Party.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/world/asia/turkey-election-erdogan.html"}
