She was 75.\nHer death was confirmed by the Sperone Westwater gallery, which has represented her for more than 30 years. A specific cause was not given, though she had been ill for some time.\nAs an art student at Cornell University, Ms. Rothenberg dreamed of becoming a sculptor but switched to painting after the head of the sculpture department flunked her, seemingly displeased with fetishistic pieces resembling alarm clocks with teeth that she had made under the influence of Lucas Samaras.\n“I was devastated,” she said in a 1992 interview with The Buffalo News. “It completely changed my life. I have no idea how I might have offended him.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/arts/susan-rothenberg-dead.html"}
