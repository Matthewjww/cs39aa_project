It was an unusual move by a court in a country where the police are generally allowed to act with impunity, human rights activists said.\nThe shooting in April, in which the tea vendor was killed and two other people were wounded, set off protests in Cairo.\nThe sentence, which is subject to appeal, was a rare punitive response to police violence in Egypt, where “the vast majority of incidents in which security force have used excessive force have gone without investigation,” said Nicholas Pichaud, an Egypt researcher at Amnesty International.\nAlso on Wednesday, the Egyptian authorities paved the way for a former prime minister who fled the country to return, removing his name from a watch list, his lawyer said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/world/middleeast/egypt-police-life-sentence-tea-dispute.html"}
