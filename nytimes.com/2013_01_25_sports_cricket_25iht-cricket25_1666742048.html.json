No other team has won the trophy more than seven times.\nSaurashtra, from India’s northwestern coast, has not won the trophy since 1937, when it was known as Nawanagar, and has not played in the final since 1938. Mumbai last won in 2010. (Rajasthan, which won the trophy the last two years, did not make it out of the group stage this season.)\nTo add to the pressure, Mumbai also has home advantage; the match, scheduled for five days, will be played in Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, site of the 2011 World Cup final.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/cricket/25iht-cricket25.html"}
