Only about a quarter of these are deployed, and most of the others are in reserve or set aside to be dismantled. North Korea's arsenal is cloaked in secrecy, but experts believe it has fewer than 10 weapons.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/23/world/nuclear-weapon-countries.html"}
