Not now, after what these players have been through. It is important not to give her recognition.\nThink of it as protest jujitsu.\nThe W.N.B.A. finals have begun. On Sunday, the Seattle Storm defeated the Las Vegas Aces, 104-91, to take a two-games-to-none lead in their best-of-five series. Game 3 is Tuesday night.\nIn its 24th year, the women’s league has some of the most incandescent players in basketball but still struggles for broad recognition and respect. In this strange season, which unfolded in a Florida arena without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic, the minimalist environment has provided a bright backdrop for the league’s evolving talent to shine.\nThe legacy of the 2020 season, however, will not only be about on-court action and a championship won. It will also be about the W.N.B.A.’s continued leadership in the battle for human rights.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/sports/basketball/wnba-loeffler-warnock-blm.html"}
