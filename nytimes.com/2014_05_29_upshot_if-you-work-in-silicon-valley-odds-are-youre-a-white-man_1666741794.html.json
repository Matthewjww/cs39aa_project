Other people aren’t so lucky.\nThe industry has been known to have a serious diversity problem. But on Wednesday, we got a peek at just how bad it is. Google released statistics about the make-up of its work force: Men and Asians are overrepresented, and women and blacks are drastically underrepresented as compared to the overall United States work force.\nMost startling: Just 17 percent of Google’s technical employees are women and just 1 percent are black. In the software industry over all, according to the Labor Department, 20 percent of engineers are women and 4 percent are black.\nAt the entire company, when nontechnical roles are included, women account for 30 percent of employees. That is 17 percentage points below the share of women in the work force, and about equal to women’s representation among lawyers, surgeons and chief executive officers.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/upshot/if-you-work-in-silicon-valley-odds-are-youre-a-white-man.html"}
