It’s a crisis that could topple Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is accused of attending at least one gathering, tolerating others and misleading Parliament about them.\nFacing a mutiny in his own Conservative Party, Mr. Johnson has appealed to the lawmakers threatening to remove him to wait for Ms. Gray’s report to establish the facts, giving her significant influence over his political fate. A damning report may result in a no-confidence vote, one the prime minister could lose.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/world/europe/sue-gray-report-boris-johnson.html"}
