He had given the ball away, but he made no effort to atone for his error, no attempt to regain control. He stopped, waited a beat, and then looked to the other end of the field. It was as if he knew what was going to happen, and he did not care — or could not bear — to watch.\nOnce it had happened, Quique Sétien turned away, too, with a shake of the head and a shrug of the shoulders, looking to his coaching staff for an explanation or a bit of solace or confirmation that this was not real — because it could not be real — and it was all some horrible hallucination. On the field, his players stared, glassy-eyed. In the stands, his socially distanced substitutes kicked the seats in front of them in pain and rage and humiliation.\nThat was at seven. Bayern Munich had scored seven goals against mighty Barcelona, the Barcelona of Messi and Busquets and Piqué and Suárez, in a Champions League quarterfinal, with the whole world watching. It was unthinkable, unfathomable, unbearable. It was as low as they could fall.\nAnd then Bayern Munich scored an eighth.\nRome was bad, in 2018. Barcelona had won the first leg of that quarterfinal easily, by 4-1 at Camp Nou. Few gave Roma much of a chance in the return: a chance to restore a bit of pride, maybe. But Barcelona collapsed, losing by 3-0. Messi and his teammates brooded on it for months. At the start of the next season, he gave a speech outlining his determination to put it right.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/sports/soccer/bayern-barcelona-8-2-champions-league.html"}
