''I did not commit them.''\nMr. Miller's lawyers, Joel Levine and Stanley Greenberg, have said they will seek to have the conviction overturned on the basis of rulings in favor of the prosecution made by Judge Kenyon in the trial.\nJudge Kenyon, in comments from the bench, defended his handling of the case as evenhanded, and added that he had gone out of his way to assure that the defense lawyers, who were chosen by Mr. Miller but were compensated by the court, were paid enough to insure their participation in both of Mr. Miller's trials.\nThe judge also noted that he had scheduled Mr. Miller's accused co-conspirators, Svetlana and Nikolay Ogorodnikov, to be tried first. He called that ruling ''a great advantage'' to the defense lawyers because it gave them a chance to try out Mr. Miller's effectiveness on the witness stand and to do so under immunity. The defense lawyers did not call Mr. Miller to testify at his own trials.\nJudge Kenyon said he was drawing upon a lesson he had learned at his mother's knee to brand Mr. Miller ''a man who lacks gratitude.''\n''A man who lacks gratitude is bound to be a tormented man,'' the judge said, referring to Mr. Miller's eight children, his wife, his ''opportunity to serve his country'' in the F.B.I., and his ''humane'' superiors in the bureau.\nJudge Kenyon praised the Federal Bureau of Investigation for ''the integrity'' with which it handled the Miller case and said that, if anything, the bureau's officials and agents could be criticized for having been ''as humane as they were toward him.''\nIn a sentencing memorandum last week, United States Attorney Robert C. Bonner and an assistant, Russell Hayman, who prosecuted the case, told the judge that Mr. Miller deserved a life sentence because of his position of trust as an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/15/us/ex-fbi-agent-is-sentenced-to-life-terms-for-espionage.html"}
