The drop ends a string of 25 quarters of economic growth in Britain. Analysts had predicted growth to be unchanged from the first quarter.\nThe British pound, which has been slumping for months, lurched further after the report was released, falling a fraction below $1.21.\nThe economic slowdown occurred across Britain’s manufacturing, construction and agriculture sectors. Only the services sector showed a small uptick, according to the statistics agency.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/business/british-economy-second-quarter-shrinks.html"}
