Yet this panel established by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will also seek to address Israel’s chief complaint: the question of how weapons ended up in some United Nations compounds in Gaza.\n“The secretary general expects that the board will enjoy the full cooperation of all parties concerned,” his office said in a statement.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/world/middleeast/un-to-investigate-strikes-on-its-facilities-in-gaza.html"}
