It traces back to the Korean War.\nCongress enacted it with military necessities like steel and tanks in mind, but lawmakers expanded it after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to cover other areas, including public health and safety. It was reauthorized last year until 2025.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/defense-production-act-virus.html"}
