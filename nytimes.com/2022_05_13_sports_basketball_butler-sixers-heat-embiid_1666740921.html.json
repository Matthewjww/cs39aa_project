The two stars were teammates in Philadelphia during the 2018-19 season, and there was a time when Butler thought he might remain in the city longer. The 76ers had other plans, though, and that slight has stayed with Butler.\nMoments after he embraced Embiid, Butler was asked what he had said.\n“That I love him; I’m proud of him,” Butler said in a television interview. “Yes, yes, yes, I still wish I was on his team. I definitely love the Miami Heat, though, man. I’m glad that I’m here.”\nThe Miami Heat are glad, too.\nIn the three seasons since he moved south from Philadelphia, Butler has led the Heat to the Eastern Conference finals twice. The 76ers, who were on the cusp of a conference finals berth with Butler and Embiid, are still trying to figure out how to get past the second round.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/13/sports/basketball/butler-sixers-heat-embiid.html"}
