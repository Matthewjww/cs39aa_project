Only a fraction of customers in the individual market pay the sticker price for insurance. The federal government helps subsidize the rest.\nThe Republican plan, while lowering the sticker price, would also lower the value of government subsidies for most groups. If you take those subsidies into account, the insurance cost for a given person doesn’t always go down.\nThe budget office also predicts that, because of less-generous subsidies, a larger share of people would buy a so-called bronze plan, which covers only about 60 percent of the average customer’s medical bills. Under Obamacare, the most popular plan, silver, covers at least 70 percent of typical expenses.\nThat means middle-income people would be asked to pay more for insurance, and their plan would also come with a significantly higher deductible.\nThe legislation is devised to make insurance more affordable for younger Americans, who have tended to opt out of coverage under Obamacare. It succeeds in lowering their premiums at most income levels.\nBut the plan balances those reductions by increasing the gap between the sticker price and the subsidy amount for older Americans. A 64-year-old at nearly every income level would have to pay a much larger share of income to buy insurance that covers a smaller share of her medical bills.\nGiven that trade-off, the budget office thinks fewer older Americans would have health insurance. That decrease helps drive down the average sticker price, too.\nFinally, the report predicted that about half of states would eliminate rules requiring insurance plans to cover a minimum, standard set of benefits, such as mental health treatment and prescription drugs. That means that the 20 percent average price decrease would include plans that require customers to pay for substantial parts of their care out of their own pockets.\nSince 2014, states have had an option to expand their Medicaid programs to cover all adults earning below or just above the federal poverty line, and 31 states have chosen to expand. Many adults who earn less in states that didn’t expand have few good insurance options, since Obamacare did not make them eligible for subsidies to buy their own insurance.\nHow the annual cost would change for a poor person in states without Medicaid expansion\nA person earning $11,400 buying ...
