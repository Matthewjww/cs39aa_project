It also put worries about terrorism back at the forefront of a campaign that had focused mostly on economic issues.\nThe two men, French citizens aged 23 and 29, were arrested Tuesday morning in the southern port city of Marseille, according to François Molins, a prosecutor in Paris who handles terrorism investigations nationwide.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/world/europe/france-presidential-election-attack-plot.html"}
