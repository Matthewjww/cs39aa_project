Putin of Russia remain unclear, and the intelligence does not show that he has decided to carry out the apparent war plan.\nBut the intelligence depicts a Russian military machine springing into action and positioning itself for an attack against which experts say Ukraine’s military would stand little chance. About half of the Russian forces that would be used in an invasion are already near Ukraine’s border, and Moscow is moving swiftly to build up a large force of contract military reservists, according to a Biden administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/us/politics/russia-ukraine-biden.html"}
