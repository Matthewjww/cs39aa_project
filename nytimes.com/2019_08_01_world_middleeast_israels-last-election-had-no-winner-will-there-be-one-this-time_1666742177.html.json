The main candidates, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the conservative Likud party and Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White, are unchanged. Campaign slogans from April’s inconclusive election have been resurrected. Mr. Netanyahu, billboards declare, is still in a “different league.”\nBut on Thursday, when the deadline passed for parties to register and the final lineup became known, Israelis already seemed to be looking past the do-over election on Sept. 17 to the bruising coalition negotiations that are expected to follow.\nPolls again show Likud and Blue and White are neck and neck — raising the potential of another unclear outcome two months after Mr. Netanyahu couldn’t form a governing coalition following the first vote.\nIn Israel’s parliamentary system, no single party has ever won an outright majority. Analysts suggest that the usual right-wing-religious and center-left blocs may not be able to muster a 61-seat majority in Parliament on their own at this point — so they may have to resort to new political marriages to form a government.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/world/middleeast/israels-last-election-had-no-winner-will-there-be-one-this-time.html"}
