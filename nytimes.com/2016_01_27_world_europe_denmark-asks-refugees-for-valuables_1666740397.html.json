The move underscored an anti-immigration backlash that has prompted several European countries to seek ways to discourage migrants from entering.\nUnder the law, which passed by a sizable majority after several hours of debate, refugees who enter Denmark with assets of more than 10,000 kroner, about $1,450, would have to contribute toward the costs of their lodging. After a global outcry over the law, however, goods with sentimental value like wedding rings and family portraits are exempt from seizure.\nThe bill also stipulates that asylum seekers must wait three years before they can apply to bring their families to Denmark, a provision that some advocates for refugees have criticized as inhumane.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/world/europe/denmark-asks-refugees-for-valuables.html"}
