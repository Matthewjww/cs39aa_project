The long-awaited policy shift will reduce the chance that friendly countries will turn for drones to Israel or China, which also manufacture unmanned military aircraft for export.\nThe State Department said the new policy set strict standards for the sale of armed drones, including “end-use assurances” from the recipient countries that set out how they can be used. For drones capable of carrying large weapons, there will be a “strong presumption of denial” of an export license. But exceptions will be allowed on “rare occasions,” the department said, citing language that also governs other weapons exports.\nThe export rules will not permit buyers to use American drones “to conduct unlawful surveillance or use unlawful force against their domestic populations,” the State Department said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/world/new-rules-set-on-armed-drone-exports.html"}
