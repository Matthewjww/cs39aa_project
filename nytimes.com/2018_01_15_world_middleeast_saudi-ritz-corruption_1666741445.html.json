Previous dates showed “Not Available for Check-In.”\nBookings had been blocked for more than two months.\nThe resumption appeared to signal that the mass arrests of Saudi princes, officials and business executives begun in November are winding down — at least to the level where the hotel can be restored to its original purpose.\nAlthough the Saudi authorities have said the crackdown is tied to corruption, rights groups have suggested that the detentions are a thinly disguised extortion attempt by the government to reclaim assets.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/world/middleeast/saudi-ritz-corruption.html"}
