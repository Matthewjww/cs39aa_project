Cervas, the court-appointed special master, would unwind changes that Democrats had hoped to use to unseat Representative Nicole Malliotakis, a Staten Island Republican; flip other Republican-held swing districts; and secure their own tenuous seats in the Hudson Valley region.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/16/nyregion/ny-redistricting-congressional-map.html"}
