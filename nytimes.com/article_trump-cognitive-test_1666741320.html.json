But he once again has not said what test he took, or what his score was, making it difficult to know what to make of his claims.\nHe has, however, provided a few clues.\nIn an interview with Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday,” in which Mr. Wallace said one question was to identify an elephant, Mr. Trump did not contradict him. One popular test, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or MOCA, has a drawing of three animals that patients are asked to identify. It is a 10-minute screening exam meant to highlight possible problems with thinking and memory.\nBut it is by no means definitive, or even diagnostic, experts pointed out. And as the president tries to draw a contrast between his mental faculties and those of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a fellow septuagenarian he expects to face off against in November’s election, some experts criticize his politicization of such cognitive screening tests.\n“The way our president is having a conversation about mental health is not helpful,” said Dr. Jason Karlawish, a dementia researcher at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-cognitive-test.html"}
