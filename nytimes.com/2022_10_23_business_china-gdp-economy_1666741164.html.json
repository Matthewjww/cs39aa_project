He praised Marxism over markets. He placed security ahead of the economy.\nNow, with his grip on China tighter than it has ever been, Mr. Xi begins a groundbreaking third term this week poised to expand the influence of the Communist Party over the economy.\nMr. Xi’s belief in the primacy of the party could shift the world’s second-largest economy back toward a more state-led model. Mr. Xi’s consolidation of power points to a new era in China in which national security and ideology would be a higher priority than maintaining robust growth. That could be bad news for an economy that has already been dragged down by official policies such as the stringent “zero Covid” strategy of lockdowns and mass testing.\nFinancial markets are already signaling their unease over what Mr. Xi’s extended rule — and his agenda — portend for China. In Hong Kong, share prices plummeted more than 6 percent on Monday, reaching 13-year lows as traders dumped huge numbers of shares to limit their exposure to whatever Mr. Xi might do next.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/business/china-gdp-economy.html"}
