Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, who died on Tuesday.\nMany Russians blame and revile Mr. Gorbachev for the breakup of the Soviet Union, but people of all ages, many of whom stood solemnly clutching flowers outside Moscow’s famed House of the Unions, said that they had come to thank him for something severely restricted today in Russia: freedom.\n“Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev gave us 30 years of sunlight,” said Maksim, 20, a political science student, who carried a large sunflower to place before Mr. Gorbachev’s body, which was lying in state in the building’s grand hall.\n“Unfortunately, this time has passed, and there is no more sun, only darkness,” Maksim said. “But I am deeply grateful to him for these 30 years.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/03/world/europe/mikhail-gorbachev-russia-funeral.html"}
