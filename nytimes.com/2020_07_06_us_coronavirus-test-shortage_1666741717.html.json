Chan School of Public Health. “We don’t have a good way to load-balance the system.”\nTesting delays and shortages have increasingly become a problem in Texas, where cases are surging.\nCities like San Antonio and Austin have reverted to testing only those who are showing symptoms as a way to manage the demand and a backlog of tests.\n“We’re now focused on the highest priorities,” Mayor Steve Adler of Austin said on Monday.\nMr. Adler, a Democrat, said the testing crunch was the result of the demand for tests statewide, brought on by the uptick in coronavirus cases after Texas reopened in fast-moving phases starting on May 1. He attributed the problem in large part to a backlog at laboratories; in some cases, test results take four to six days, far longer than the 24 hours health experts recommend to most effectively isolate the ill and track people they have had contact with.\nLocal officials in Austin had not relied on the state when it came to testing for the most part, the mayor said. And without a national testing program, he said, city and county officials had to fend for themselves in the private market.\n“Maybe in retrospect if we had thought about this a half-year ago, we would have set up our own testing capacity,” Mr. Adler said. “I don’t know what else we’d do. We were out competing for tests. We were blocking up as many tests as we could block up on the market.”\nMr. Adler said the testing system needed to be federalized, so that Austin and other cities would not have to compete for testing labs and supplies with other cities and other states.\nThe problem extends far beyond Texas and Arizona, among the hot spots that have led the country in rising cases in recent weeks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/coronavirus-test-shortage.html"}
