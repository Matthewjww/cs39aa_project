Texas had made a similar decision days earlier.\nStates can ask the Treasury Department to reallocate unused money already authorized by Congress to fund rent-relief programs across the country, and Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York has requested that an additional $1 billion be shifted to New York. A final decision has not yet been made in Washington on new disbursements.\nIn New York, lawmakers included a unique protection as part of the stateâ€™s program: landlords are barred from evicting tenants while an application with the state is pending. Housing advocates and some elected leaders have argued that New York, by closing the door on new applications, removed one of the key protections against eviction in a state with a huge number of renters and where the economic rebound has lagged.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/14/nyregion/new-york-covid-rent-relief-lawsuit.html"}
