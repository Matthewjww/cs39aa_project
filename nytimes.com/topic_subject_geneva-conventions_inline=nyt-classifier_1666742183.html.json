The fourth convention governs the protection of civilians. The conventions were updated by two protocols in 1977, in large part to deal with African guerrilla movements, to govern the protection of victims in international and domesticl armed conflicts.While countries and militaries conduct internal investigations, and occasionally courts-martial, it is unclear in what forum any international war crimes trial would take place; neither the United States nor Israel, for example, has accepted the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.The texts of all the Geneva Conventions and the Protocols can be found on the Web site of the International Committee for the Red Cross.", "filename": "topic_subject_geneva-conventions_inline=nyt-classifier_1666742183.html", "image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/matthewwhite/news-please-repo//data/2022/10/25/nytimes.com/topic_subject_geneva-conventions_inline=nyt-classifier_1666742183.html", "title": "Geneva Conventions", "title_page": "Geneva Conventions - The New York Times", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "maintext": "Reporterâ€™s Notebook\nThe Singular Offense of the Mass Grave\nViolent loss is even more devastating when the dead are disposed of without identification.
