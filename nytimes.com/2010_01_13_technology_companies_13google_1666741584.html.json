They cannot call Google for help, and the company warns that it may take up to 48 hours to respond to e-mail messages.\nUnlike other phones that run on Android, like the Motorola Droid or the T-Mobile G1, the Nexus One was developed and branded by Google and is sold directly by the company to customers.\nBut ever since the phone went on sale Jan. 5, customer forums have been filled with a cacophony of gripes about the Nexus One. And Google, more accustomed to providing minimal support for its free services, has been unprepared to deal with the higher service expectations of customers who are paying as much as $529 for its high-end smartphone.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/technology/companies/13google.html"}
