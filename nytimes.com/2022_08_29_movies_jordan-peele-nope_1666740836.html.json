Now that it has crossed the $100 million mark domestically, do you feel hopeful about the future of moviegoing?\nWell, I felt like by the time the film came out, the industry was not in need of saving.

It’s my link to myself and other people in so many ways and has taught me to love film. So I just wanted to make a movie that people would have to go to the theater to see. In a way, if I was going to tell any story, I would want to tell something that was an escape into an immersive experience.\nHow did you decide to use IMAX cameras for it? I know they can be a challenge to shoot with since they are so bulky, can be noisy and are limited in the amount of footage they can capture before having to reload.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/29/movies/jordan-peele-nope.html"}
