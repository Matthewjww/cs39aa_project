No, I think.\nmichael barbaro\nI cannot see you, but I can hear you. And I think I can hear you — ah, now I can see you.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nOK. Sorry for my English. I don’t know if my English will be adequate for a podcast. But then you will decide, OK?\nmichael barbaro\nIt’s exceptional. And I’m really grateful that you’re making time for us.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nThank you. Thank you.\nmichael barbaro\nSo, where are you right now?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nNow, I’m at home. After three weeks, today, in the afternoon, I am at home, because I have a big family with three children. And I decide to come back at home one day.\nmichael barbaro\nSo you have not been home in three weeks?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nThree weeks, yes. I have been in my hospital every day, start of the crisis, Friday the 21st of February. And since then, it was a total mess. It’s like a war, to be honest.\nmichael barbaro\nFrom the New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n[music]\narchived recording This is how Italy’s cases have grown now for the last month — slowly at first, but now more rapidly. It’s a textbook epidemic curve.\nmichael barbaro\nItaly has quickly become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with nearly 30,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, numbers that are soaring by the day, even after the government there took extreme measures to lock down much of the country.\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) We are at a critical inflection point in this country.\nmichael barbaro\nOn Monday, the U.S. surgeon general warned that the United States is now on a strikingly similar path.\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers. And we have a choice to make as a nation. Do we want to go the direction of South Korea and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates? Or do we want to go the direction of Italy?\nmichael barbaro\nToday, a conversation with a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, one of Italy’s hardest hit areas.\n[music]\nIt’s Tuesday, March 17.\nmichael barbaro\nCould I just ask you to just say your full name for me?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nOK. My name is Fabiano Di Marco. I’m a professor of the University of Milan and the head of the respiratory unit of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, which is a town close to Milan.\nmichael barbaro\nCan you give me a sense, and maybe paint the picture, of what it’s like in the hospital right now, what you’re dealing with?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nI have now — my ward has been totally transformed. Nothing is as before. I’ve been in my hospital every single day for 14 hours or 15 hours a day —\nmichael barbaro\nWow.\ndr. fabiano di marco\n— to try to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus infection.\nmichael barbaro\nWhat has been the story of what has happened in your hospital these past few weeks? Because I think people in the United States are desperate to understand what you have seen, and what people have said to you, and what it has looked like. You described it as a war. So we want to understand what you mean.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nOK. Every day we receive, on average, between 50 to 70 patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection. Every single day. And to describe my reality, my hospital is, at least in Europe, a huge hospital with 1,000 beds. But to receive every day between 50 and 70 patients with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus, it’s impossible. You have to change your organization day by day.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd tell me what you mean. How do you have to change your organization to deal with people who are in such severe respiratory condition?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nSo we change it, the normal ward, mainly surgery wards, because the activity of surgery has been reduced off at least 80 percent. And we transform it, so far five wards of surgery for patients with coronavirus. Now we have, between the five wards and the emergency room, at least 350 patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.\nmichael barbaro\nWow.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nToday is the first day in which we have more than 50 percent of the hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients. To organize these, we had to teach cardiologists, dermatologists, rheumatologists — specialists of something very different from respiratory failure — how to treat this patient. You try to find a solution. But day by day, it’s no longer enough. So I can tell you that my colleagues, both physicians and nurses, they cry every day.\nmichael barbaro\nWow.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nI’m 47. I’m not so, so old to be the head of a ward, at least in Italy. But I have with me 20 colleagues who are respiratory physician, with many fellow. They are 27, 30. So for me, it’s a huge responsibility. And I was scared they can be sick. OK? But we cry every day. And now, we have today, 460 nurse at home because they are sick. And I think we have —\nmichael barbaro\nWow.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYes. It’s a very huge number.\nmichael barbaro\nYou have 460 nurses who are in a hospital in the middle of this crisis who are home because they’re sick?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah, today. This is the outcome of today.\nmichael barbaro\nAnd is that because they are sick with the coronavirus?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nThere are some who are sick, some with a total burnout for the situation, and other who are contact of patients, so they stay in quarantine at home.\nmichael barbaro\nDoctor, you said you are upset, that you maybe even cry every day. And I wonder if there is an experience, maybe one story or one patient, that made you upset?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nThe main problem for us is to treat our colleagues. As doctor, we are used to treat patients. And for us it’s normal. There is not so emotional, luckily, because we are used to treat other people. But this is difficult when the patient is your colleague. And we have now admitted tens of colleagues or nurse, people who you will meet every day in your life.\nmichael barbaro\nYour colleagues are now your patients because they have contracted the virus.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nAbsolutely. For example, yesterday, the chief of my department come to the emergency room to be with a low level of oxygenation. He has a bilateral pneumonia due to coronavirus.\nmichael barbaro\nWow. I’m sorry.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nNot very severe. But he was someone who tried to organize the hospital to deal with this infection three days ago. And we went to have a dinner with my wife and his wife one week ago.\nmichael barbaro\nWow.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nI don’t know. We are scared because on Friday, only in my hospital, we had 20 deaths.\nmichael barbaro\n20 deaths.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah. For coronavirus. In one day.\nmichael barbaro\nThat’s extraordinary.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah. So another important thing, we have not had the opportunity to allow the relative to come to the hospital for two reasons. First, it’s a danger for them and for other people, evidently, because in 80 percent of the cases, they are infected. The second reason, which is not easy to understand if you are not in this situation, is that we do not have enough personal protective equipment — the mask in case of infection, something to cover the shoes, and the gown. It’s impossible to find these now Europe, not only in Italy.\nmichael barbaro\nSo you’re running out of those and you can’t get them anywhere, in the region or anywhere in Europe. You just can’t get them.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah. Impossible to find.\nmichael barbaro\nWow.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nIf I allow one or two relative to come to the hospital, I have to give them these. But we do not have this for us.\nmichael barbaro\nRight. You need them for doctors.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah. They cannot receive the relative in hospital. So the patients are alone. And they die alone. We — this is difficult for us. We try to call, every day, the relative. But I have to tell you that sometimes, in the confusion of this new organization with a dermatologist who is trying to treat a patient with severe respiratory failure, and probably the doctors cry, and the — no one remember to call the relative. So it’s happened that the relative call the hospital —\nmichael barbaro\nAnd the person’s already dead.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah.\n[music]\nmichael barbaro\nWe’ll be right back. Doctor, you’ve mentioned a lot of the choices that you and your staff have to make now that this is such a terrible situation. And I wonder how you make decisions about who gets which treatment, and who has the best chance to survive. How do you make those decisions?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nThis is, for us, a crucial point, because we have hundreds of very sick patients. But we have tens of I.C.U. beds.\nmichael barbaro\nRight.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nThe problem is that you can find many scores of gravity. But these scores of gravity have been thought for another reason. OK?\nmichael barbaro\nAnd when you say score of gravity, you mean, basically, kind of a calculation of who is in greatest need?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nAbsolutely. So for instance, if you are 80, you have a severe respiratory failure, and I don’t know, you have also renal failure, I have to admit you in the I.C.U. because you are very severe. And you have a probability to die very high. OK. I have to admit you in the I.C.U.. But now we need another score, which is a score which help us to understand your probability to benefit of the I.C.U. bed. And we do not have this score. OK?\nmichael barbaro\nBecause it has not been created.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nAbsolutely. We are trying to do this now, because for example, the age, for all of the stage of severity, higher is the age, higher is the score. But when you have few beds for many people, the age is absolutely the opposite. If you are 85, I give the bed to another one who is 45.\nmichael barbaro\nBecause 45-year-old is more likely to benefit from the I.C.U. bed than the 80-year-old. So you’re saying all the normal rules have to be thrown out the window.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nAbsolutely. We need a new tool we do not have, because so far, the difference between the number of patients, number or bed, is something totally new for us. OK? And not only for us, all the country will have to deal with this. But it’s difficult to tell people that if you are 80, you will never have the I.C.U. bed.\nmichael barbaro\nOf course.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nBut so far, if you have not the opportunity to build a new hospital with 1,000 bed, such as in China, we need this terrible tool, because this is a tool of selection.\nmichael barbaro\nRight — of who lives and who dies.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah. And this is why it’s important. If you do not reduce the number of patients who are sick, it’s impossible to deal with this disease. Impossible. You have to reduce the rate of infection. And the only way to reduce the rate of infection is to change totally the life of people. Now, in Italy, everyone is at home. This is a tragedy for economy. No one is working. No one is working. But it’s the only way. There is not something in between.\nmichael barbaro\nIt sounds like you’re saying that once you are in a hospital as a doctor, looking at a room full of people with this virus, overwhelmed, it’s too late. That the role of countries who are not yet at the place Italy is in is to make sure they don’t ever get to that place, don’t ever get to the point that your hospital is at. And to do whatever it takes to not get there.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nAbsolutely. You have two choices. You decide to not close all the activities, close the people in their home, and you will accept thousand of beds. Or, you have to close all the activity. There is not a choice in between. I know this is difficult to have this approach, because also in Italy, if you speak with my colleague in another town, it’s quite difficult to understand this. Because many people, including many physicians, have not this perception of this. Because in your reality, all is normal. It’s difficult to be scared for something you have not the perception. OK? So I can understand that in other countries, it’s the same. But trust us, or, such as in Bergamo, each family will have a relative or a friend who dies. This is the situation in Bergamo. This is not a disease that you can discuss on TV, or you will have the perception of this in your family, in your relative, in your town. It’s something very aggressive, very aggressive.\nmichael barbaro\nI wonder, as a doctor, what advice you would give to doctors in the United States who may have to do what you have to do and make the kind of difficult decisions that you have to make now.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nI think that the best is to speak with us to analyze the situation of Italy. It could be something important. Because you have to be prepared for this. This is the only thing I would suggest to my colleague. Because also in Italy, I have some colleague in the other part of Italy who are not prepared. And I speak with them. They are doing the same thing we did three weeks ago. This is incredible. This new reality we are living started the 23rd of February, not three years ago. OK? Three weeks ago. After three weeks, we are living in another dimension. For me, it’s difficult to think to my life before this. No one can be prepared for this — impossible.\nmichael barbaro\nI wonder, just a final question here. At the beginning of our conversation, you said you were finally home after three weeks. And I wonder what it was like to come home to your family. What are you telling them? And how are you feeling?\ndr. fabiano di marco\nMy children are at home now for three weeks. The schools are closed. Luckily there are three, so they can stay together. But we try to create a normal situation at home. For me, it’s difficult, because evidently, I have a risk of infection which is higher than compared to other people. So I had to decide what to do at home. If stay with a mask — sorry. And I decide to stay normal, without the mask.\nmichael barbaro\nIt sounds like this was a tough decision.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah, because I have to find the solution between to protect the best, uh, my wife and do not scare my children. OK? The only good news is that children and young boys or girls are not affected. This is the only consolation for us. And I decide that I changed my approach to my children. OK? I pay attention to my hands. I pay attention to my towel. OK? But I decide to not wear a mask because it will be difficult for them to see the father who is a respiratory physician in Bergamo with those kind of cases, hundreds of that. So also for these, it’s really difficult to decide what is the best. And then I spoke with my wife. And we decided to do this.\nmichael barbaro\nIt sounds like on top of all the difficult decisions you’ve had to make, you had to go home and make one more difficult decision, which was this mask.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nYeah. Absolutely.\n[music]\nmichael barbaro\nDoctor, I really want to thank you so much for giving us your time. And I want to wish you the best of luck, you and all your colleagues, doctors and nurses at the hospital. We’re going to be thinking about you a lot in the coming days.\ndr. fabiano di marco\nThank you. Thank you. It has been a privilege. I hope, indeed, to be useful for some of my colleagues and for you.\n[music]\nmichael barbaro\nWe’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.\narchived recording (donald trump) This afternoon, we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping —\nmichael barbaro\nOn Monday, President Trump issued sweeping new health guidelines for Americans, encouraging them to work from home, avoid restaurants, bars, and food courts, and discretionary travel, and limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer.\narchived recording (donald trump) If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation. And we will defeat the virus. And we’re going to have a big celebration all together.\nmichael barbaro\nBut the guidelines are not mandatory. And the president stopped short of explicitly ordering Americans to stay home, as several countries in Europe and a handful of U.S. counties are now doing. On Monday, health officials in the Bay Area of California instructed nearly 7 million people to remain in their homes, with few exceptions, to slow the virus’s spread.\narchived recording These new orders direct all individuals to shelter at their place of residence and maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from any other person when outside their residence. We know we need to do this. And we know we need a regional approach.\nmichael barbaro", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/12italy-coronavirus-health-care.html"}
