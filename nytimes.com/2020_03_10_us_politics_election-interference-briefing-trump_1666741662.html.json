The previous briefing drew angry responses from House Republicans.\nMr. Trump attacked the briefings earlier in the day, accusing Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of dwelling too much on Russian election interference. “There is another Russia, Russia, Russia meeting today,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “It is headed up by corrupt politician Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, so I wouldn’t expect too much!”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/politics/election-interference-briefing-trump.html"}
