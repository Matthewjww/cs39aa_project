On Monday, a trial court in Moscow sentenced him to three and a half years in a penal colony for assaulting a police officer during his arrest at a recent protest rally in central Moscow.\nThe trial judge refused to admit as evidence a video that appeared to contradict the prosecution’s case, relying instead on the testimony of the officer, whose shoulder had been dislocated during the arrest. Prosecutors called for a sentence of six years.\nThe video showed four officers in riot gear attacking Mr. Ustinov in a busy Moscow square at the time of a protest rally nearby, pushing him to the pavement and hitting him with rubber batons. It was not clear why they had singled him out.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/world/europe/russia-actor-pavel-ustinov.html"}
