He was once a barista in a place like this, but today he works in the oldest profession.\n“I think I’m doing something more important for people than making another latte,” he said.\nTall, taut, with bleached blond hair, James, 25, asked to only be identified by his first name only for fear of legal reprisals, but spoke candidly about his life as a sex worker, offering a rare glimpse into a local subculture that has become the subject of much debate: sex workers, including James, who say they have freely chosen this vocation.\nJames said he was self-employed — no one manages his affairs, hires him out or takes a cut of his earnings. “I run myself — that’s why I do what I do,” he said.\nFor a $100 fee, he provides “healing erotic touch.” He finds most customers on Craigslist, the online classified service. “It’s how I support myself,” he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/us/06bcjames.html"}
