With some patience and attention, you can turn these opinions into a piece of written criticism: a review.\nAdvice from experts might help. To support students who are interested in writing their own reviews, whether for our annual review contest or just for fun, we asked Times critics who work in four different genres to share their advice.\nIn the four short videos below, you’ll learn more about how to explain your opinion, persuade a reader, consider a work’s context and examine the artist’s intent. For each video, we provide reflection questions to help students apply the advice to their own writing.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/learning/want-to-write-a-review-heres-advice-from-new-york-times-critics.html"}
