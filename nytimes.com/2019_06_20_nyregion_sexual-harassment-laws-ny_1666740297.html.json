Female aides and even lawmakers who tried to complain were ignored or paid to be silent.\nEven when harassment scandals burst into public view, lawmakers did not propose bills to strengthen workplace protections, promising instead to dedicate themselves to internal reform.\nBut under the newly Democrat-led Legislature, that era seems to have ended. Earlier this year, the state held its first public hearings on the issue in nearly 30 years. And on Wednesday, lawmakers passed sweeping anti-harassment legislation that supporters said would make New York’s laws among the most robust in the nation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/nyregion/sexual-harassment-laws-ny.html"}
