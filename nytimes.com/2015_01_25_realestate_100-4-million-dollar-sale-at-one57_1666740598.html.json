Last year, at least three estates sold for more than $100 million, including the most expensive residence in the country: an 18-acre property in East Hampton on Long Island that sold to Barry Rosenstein, a hedge fund manager, for $147 million.\nThe monthly carrying costs for unit No. 90, on the 89th and 90th floors of the 90-story condominium at 157 West 57th Street, were estimated to be around $21,950, according to the offering plan, a discounted figure that includes a tax abatement negotiated by the sponsor, the Extell Development Company.\nExtell had initially marketed the 10,923-square-foot apartment for $98.5 million, then upped the asking price to $115 million, according to the state attorney generalâ€™s office.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/realestate/100-4-million-dollar-sale-at-one57.html"}
