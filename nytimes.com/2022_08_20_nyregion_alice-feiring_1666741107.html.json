The renowned wine writer tends to pass most of the day in her neighborhood of NoLIta, where Wine Therapy, a shop that carries the natural wines she famously favors, is just down the street. The one exception? Her weekly drive to Bayside, Queens, where her mother, Ethel Feiring, lives.\nEthel figures prominently in Ms. Feiring’s new memoir, “To Fall in Love, Drink This.” Along with the wine recommendations and sketches of vintners and varietals are vivid portraits of headstrong Ethel, Ms. Feiring’s libertine father, Philip, and her beloved brother, Andrew. A serial killer and various boyfriends, past and present, also make appearances.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/20/nyregion/alice-feiring.html"}
