For each championship team in this century, you would not have needed any help finding the leadoff man.\nThe slash-and-dash lefty, Johnny Damon, would have been the obvious choice in 2004. Same for the feisty little second baseman, Dustin Pedroia, in 2007. The game’s best base stealer, Jacoby Ellsbury, looked the part in 2013, like the do-it-all dynamo, Mookie Betts, in 2018.\nIn 2021? Well, a lot is different about these Red Sox, who thumped the Houston Astros, 12-3, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series here on Monday. They had to play a wild-card game for the first time. Their rotation is deeper than Houston’s, but not nearly as strong as it usually is in October.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/sports/baseball/kyle-schwarber-red-sox.html"}
