A tent city sprang up, and smaller ones have mushroomed in parks all over Israel.\nThe young organizers, who struck a chord in a society that has long been quiescent on domestic issues, have expressed surprise at the number of Israelis who have joined their struggle.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/world/middleeast/07jerusalem.html"}
