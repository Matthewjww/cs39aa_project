It also falls short of the detailed restructuring plan from Ford that investors have been waiting to see for more than a year.\nOn the fringes of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Ford said it would develop and manufacture a compact pickup truck that the two companies may sell under their own names in South America, Africa and Europe. The truck will be based on the new Ford Ranger, which goes on sale in the next few weeks. Ford will also produce a large delivery van and Volkswagen a compact van, both primarily for Europe.\nFord expects those projects to save about $500 million a year, but not until after the vehicles are introduced in 2023.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/business/ford-volkswagen.html"}
