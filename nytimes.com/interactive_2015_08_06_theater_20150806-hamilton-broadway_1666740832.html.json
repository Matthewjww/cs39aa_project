It received 11 Tony Awards, including best musical, and 16 Tony nominations, the most nominations in Broadway history. It won the Pulitzer Prize and a Grammy Award. In his review, Ben Brantley writes: “Yes, it really is that good.”\nIt’s one of the most talked about Broadway shows since “The Book of Mormon” in 2011. Why?
