The country’s borders have been closed to almost all foreign travelers since March 2020.\nIn a new program beginning in October, vaccinated New Zealanders returning to the country may also be able to self-isolate at home and skip the 14-day hotel quarantine that is currently required.\nMs. Ardern warned, however, that the country’s borders would not return to their pre-pandemic norm, when passengers did not face vaccination or testing requirements.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/world/new-zealand-virus-reopening.html"}
