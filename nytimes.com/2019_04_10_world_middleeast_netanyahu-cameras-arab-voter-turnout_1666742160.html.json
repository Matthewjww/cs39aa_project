But that most likely resulted from several factors, analysts said, including a boycott of the vote by some Arabs over the passage of laws seen as discriminatory and a lack of robust representation.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu was in position to take a fourth consecutive term in office, with nearly all of the votes counted and the rival Blue and White alliance having conceded the race.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/world/middleeast/netanyahu-cameras-arab-voter-turnout.html"}
