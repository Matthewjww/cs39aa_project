Soe, senior director of index research and design for S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, who has been conducting the study since 2002. What’s more, at my request, the researchers reran the entire study, eliminating the effects of expenses, as captured by the funds’ expense ratios. Even without expenses, they found, nearly all actively managed domestic stock funds trailed the benchmarks over three, five and 10 years. Large-cap funds were the single exception, and only over 10 years.\nUsing a database developed at the University of Chicago, known as C.R.S.P., for the Center for Research in Security Prices, the study avoided what is known as “survivorship bias,” Ms. Soe said. For example, the latest Spiva Scorecard examined the performance and characteristics of 2,080 actively managed mutual funds in existence 10 years ago. But it found that only 58.1 percent of them had survived in the 10 years through December. The remainder closed or merged, generally because their performance was weak.\nIf only the surviving funds — which tend to have better numbers — had been included in the overall fund statistics, the total picture would have been unrealistically bright. It would have been like running a horse race in which only 58 percent of those that started crossed the finish line. If you merely tracked the speed of the finishers, you would be giving an exaggerated picture of the prowess of all those that started the race.\nIn this case, the researchers tracked the performance of all the original 2,080 funds over one, three, five and 10 years. If a fund didn’t finish, it didn’t beat the market.\nThe researchers also found that most mutual funds didn’t maintain “style consistency” over 10 years — meaning they changed the investing style that they had used when the study began. In fact, only 33.7 percent of the original funds retained their style, an enormous shift that ought to concern investors, Ms. Soe said.\n“For investors, style drift can be a very big unexpected risk,” she said.\nWhy is this significant? Consider a fund that buys stocks like Facebook, those with a high market capitalization and rapid growth. Such a fund has a large-cap growth style, and investors who hold it might think that they have bought a stake in large-cap growth stocks. But then, say, the manager shifts the fund’s holdings to small-cap value stocks. That may make sense to the manager, who presumably thinks the new stocks will perform better than the old ones, but it can cause a big headache for investors who have built diversified portfolios including this fund. If they know of the shift, they can adjust their holdings, adding cost and possible tax liability. Many people will do nothing and live with unintended risks from a skewed portfolio.\nThese problems — long-term underperformance, the demise of many lackluster funds and style drift — showed up in all categories of actively managed domestic stock mutual funds over extended periods. Most of the stock funds in each category underperformed narrow benchmarks over three, five or 10 years. For example, as a group, most small-cap value funds underperformed the S.&P. SmallCap 600 Value index.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/your-money/measure-for-measure-index-funds-rule.html"}
