Klobuchar 227,000\nNote: Data is through Dec. 31.\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont received donations from an estimated 1.4 million people through the end of 2019 — far more than any other candidate in the Democratic primary race, according to fund-raising records filed with the Federal Election Commission. The map above shows his expansive donor base around the country, including in Iowa, whose caucuses will be held on Monday.\nMr. Sanders is powering his campaign with small donations from supporters across the United States, and he collected $96 million from donors in 2019 without holding a single high-dollar fund-raising event.\nOur analysis of fund-raising records six months ago also showed his overwhelming strength in attracting donors around the country.\nThe map below — which includes the rest of the Democratic field without Mr. Sanders — provides a picture of where the other leading candidates are attracting donors.\nCandidates with the most individual donors when Sanders is excluded Where Bernie Sanders is leading, the runner-up is shown.

While she, too, has found success with that strategy, she has not matched Mr. Sanders’s success.\nPete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the second largest number of donors in Iowa as well as in New Hampshire, which will hold the nation’s first primary on Feb. 11.\nSanders Leads in Early States\nLooking at these numbers by state, Mr. Sanders is leading in all of the early states as well as all of the Super Tuesday states, except for Ms. Warren’s home state, Massachusetts, and Senator Amy Klobuchar’s home state, Minnesota.\nHow each candidate ranks in number of individual donors, by state\nSanders’s Donor Base Has Multiplied Over Time\nThis chart shows the estimated number of unique individuals who had given to each candidate over the course of 2019.
