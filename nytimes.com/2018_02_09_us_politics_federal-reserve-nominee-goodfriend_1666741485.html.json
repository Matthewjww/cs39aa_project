The central bank, which sets monetary policy and plays a leading role in financial regulation, now has just three governors on its seven-seat board, the fewest in the Fed’s modern history.\n“Three is really thin,” said Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, a research firm for investors.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/us/politics/federal-reserve-nominee-goodfriend.html"}
