Still, Sony’s information technology experts told participants in a Saturday in-house conference call that they were making inroads and that systems were likely to be back online by Monday.\nA studio spokeswoman, reached by text message, declined to comment.\nSeveral Sony executives reached on Saturday were similarly tight-lipped, though one said the studio was exploring multiple causes and had no direct information to support a theory that surfaced on the technology news site ReCode on Friday: that the attack may have been retribution by North Korea for Sony’s planned Christmas release of “The Interview,” an R-rated comedy about two American journalists who are recruited by the C.I.A. to kill the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/business/media/intrusion-on-sony-unit-prompts-a-shutdown-of-messaging-systems.html"}
