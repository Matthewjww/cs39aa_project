But if Beijing were ever to invade Taiwan, the anti-ship and antiaircraft systems could in theory be turned on Chinese military fleets. That could make the Japanese garrison a tempting target for China — and put Mr. Kinjo’s greenhouses in the line of fire.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/world/asia/ishigaki-japan-missiles-taiwan.html"}
