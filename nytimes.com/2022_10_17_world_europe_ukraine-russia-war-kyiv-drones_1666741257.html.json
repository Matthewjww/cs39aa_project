Some police officers fired at them with their rifles.\nThen the explosions began.\nBy the end of the attack, at least four people in Kyiv had been killed. Among them were a young couple who were pulled from the wreckage of a residential building, according to the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko. The woman was six months pregnant.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-kyiv-drones.html"}
