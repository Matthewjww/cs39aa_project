Previous early calls in presidential races have prompted congressional inquiries.\nThe company spearheading the effort, VoteCastr, plans real-time projections of presidential and Senate races in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It plans to publish a map and tables of its projected results on Slate, the online newsmagazine.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/us/politics/election-results-voting.html"}
