First there was a homegrown variant, called B.1.526 or Iota, which spread rapidly from January to March. That was followed this spring by the highly transmissible Alpha variant, first identified in Britain. Then by summer came the even more highly transmissible Delta variant, which caused a small wave of infections and then subsided in October before rising again in November.\nEach new variant provoked worry. But so far, the coronavirus has been diminishing as a threat, after the devastating first wave last year. The long second wave that stretched from the autumn of 2020 to this spring saw far fewer infections and deaths than the first, even as several strains of Covid-19 spread.\nThe pattern of diminishing waves is different than what has been seen in much of the country and owes something to New York City’s relatively high rate of vaccination — about 77 percent of residents of all ages have received at least one shot.\nThere are other factors: Considerable levels of natural immunity from the devastation of the first wave in spring 2020. A willingness to wear masks. Widely available testing and a robust public health apparatus.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/nyregion/new-york-covid-omicron.html"}
