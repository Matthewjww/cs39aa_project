When he cooked cocaine at laboratories deep in the jungles of Colombia, he frequently made quality-control checks, ensuring that his drugs were of the utmost purity — or “optimum,” he said.\nBut Mr. Ramírez, a former leader of the North Valley drug cartel, had another claim to fame, he told jurors on Monday: He was the primary supplier to Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican kingpin known as El Chapo. In his second day as a government witness at Mr. Guzmán’s drug conspiracy trial in Federal District Courtin Brooklyn, Mr. Ramírez detailed his 17-year bond with the defendant, describing it as the central partnership in one of modern history’s most profitable narco-operations.\nKnown as Chupeta — Spanish slang for Lollipop — Mr. Ramírez presented himself on the stand as a man consumed with the minutiae of his business, recalling how he never failed to debrief his pilots after every run and reviewed each line of the scrupulous accounting ledgers he maintained. Proud to the point of arrogance, he seldom used the word “cocaine” without reminding those in the courtroom that it was his cocaine.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html"}
