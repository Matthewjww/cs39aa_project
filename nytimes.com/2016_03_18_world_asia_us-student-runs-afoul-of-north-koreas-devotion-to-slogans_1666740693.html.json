This week, North Korea’s Supreme Court did just that to Otto F. Warmbier, a 21-year-old American student.\nBut in North Korea, where the leader is treated as a deity, political slogans are sacrosanct — a point that does not loom large in many outside appraisals of Mr. Warmbier’s plight.\nAt the beginning of each year, North Korea issues a new set of slogans as unbreakable guides. The gate of every factory and the wall of every classroom bear such slogans. The freshly painted and ubiquitous red-on-white banners are virtually the only thing that leaps out in otherwise drab North Korean towns.\nAnd the most important among them — the ones that must be treated like sacred objects — are those that bear the names of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, his father Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather, the North’s founding president, Kim Il-sung, North Korean defectors and South Korean officials say.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/world/asia/us-student-runs-afoul-of-north-koreas-devotion-to-slogans.html"}
