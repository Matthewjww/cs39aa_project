About as many said they were unable to meet current testing needs.\nSoaring demand has also exacerbated capacity issues at private laboratories such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, which together have performed one-third of the nation’s tests.\nWait times for test results from both companies have ballooned to several days — in some cases stretching well over a week.\nDavid Rohlfing, who took one of Quest’s tests at a walk-in site in Queens on July 6, said he still didn’t have his results 17 days later. That’s far longer than the four days he waited the last time he was tested at the same site, in early June. If he gets a negative result, it won’t help much, since he could have been exposed in the interim.\n“If no one is getting test results,” Mr. Rohlfing said, “we do not actually know how the opening up is going here.”\nAfter a person’s specimen is collected at a hospital, clinic or community testing site, it can go on to be processed in a dizzying bevy of places. Some are run in public health laboratories operated by governments at the federal, state or local level. Many of these facilities have been somewhat buffered from shortages by their access to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s International Reagent Resource, which maintains stocks of supplies necessary to run the agency’s in-house coronavirus tests.\nBut most state public health labs are not set up to perform diagnostics en masse, Dr. Shone said. “We’re here for the initial emergency response, then the clinical lab system of the country typically takes on the lion’s share of testing.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html"}
