Those tiny rocks slam into our atmosphere, creating trails of dazzling light as they burn up. As Earth plows into Phaethon’s debris field, the resulting meteors all appear to streak from a spot in the sky, called a radiant, where the constellation Gemini sits, hence the meteor shower’s name. Other showers originate from comets.\nWhile you may get a good look at them tonight, the Geminids presented an unusual spectacle for a few lucky viewers in December 2020.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/science/meteor-shower-geminid.html"}
