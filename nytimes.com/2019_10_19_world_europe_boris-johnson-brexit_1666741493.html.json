The only sure result was continuing frustration and confusion among the British public.\nLate on Saturday night, Mr. Johnson formally applied to the European Union, in an unsigned letter, for another extension of Britain’s departure, something he said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than do.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/world/europe/boris-johnson-brexit.html"}
