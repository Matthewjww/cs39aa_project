Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health, but only if a scientific panel decides that the benefits justify the risks.\nSome scientists are eager to pursue these studies because they may show, for example, how a bird flu could mutate to more easily infect humans, or could yield clues to making a better vaccine.\nCritics say these researchers risk creating a monster germ that could escape the lab and seed a pandemic.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/health/lethal-viruses-nih.html"}
