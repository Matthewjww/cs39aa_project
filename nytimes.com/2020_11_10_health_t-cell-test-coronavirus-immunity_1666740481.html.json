This enormous diversity among T-cell receptors enables the human body to recognize virtually any new pathogen that it may encounter (although a vast majority may never meet their match.) But it also makes it painfully onerous for scientists to identify the 20 or 30 T cells among the trillions that can recognize fragments of a specific pathogen like the coronavirus.\n“One of the brutal things about immunology is that all white blood cells look the same,” said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. “You can’t even tell B cells from T cells, let alone T cells specific to a virus.”\nTo find the T cells specific to a virus, researchers must first separate the bulk of immune cells from a few milliliters of blood, which takes time. Then they wash and count the cells, and stimulate them with pieces of the virus to identify the tiny pool of T cells that respond. The cells that are activated release a molecule called gamma interferon that serves as a signal of their activity.\n“The better the assay, the more complicated it is,” Dr. Crotty said. “You get more and more information, but it becomes more and more complicated.”\nA single researcher can process no more than five blood samples over the course of a day and a half.\n“That’s pretty much why every single paper that is done on T cells, the number of subjects that are studied is never higher than 100,” said Dr. Antonio Bertoletti, a virologist at Duke NUS Medical School in Singapore. “There has also never been great demand for wading into the intricacies of T cell tests.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/health/t-cell-test-coronavirus-immunity.html"}
