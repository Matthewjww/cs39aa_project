Many of those taking part signified their participation with the hashtag #WomenBoycottTwitter.\nHeidi Moore, an editor, was among the first to popularize the campaign, writing on Twitter, “Friday October 13th seems a good boycott day.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/technology/twitter-boycott-rose-mcgowan.html"}
