No, he wouldn’t be pleased at all. All right. I call us sanitation engineers because we’re supposed to run the job, not let the job run us. I was 24 years old when I started. But back then, it was a different ball game. Back then, the working condition, it was unbearable. After three weeks, when I got my first check, I broke down and cried. We were working full time. And at the same time, the wages were so low, we was qualified to get food stamps. We were determined that we was going to get a union organized, that we would see justice. We were striking about the wages, fair treatment and dignity. When we heard that Dr. King was coming to Memphis to help us in that sanitation strike, we were very surprised. We knew then that there was somebody that cared about our struggle. We was at Mason Temple this particular night. Dr. King said, the Lord allowed me to go to the mountaintop and to look over into the promised land. And he said, I might not get there with you, but we will make it to the promised land. Everybody was just jubilated, just excited, not knowing the next day would be a day of silence. Because of Dr. King’s death, that was one of the reasons that Mayor Loeb went on and signed that union into a decree. We got what we wanted, but at the same time, we lost the great leader. “He never thought in terms of his personal welfare, but always in terms of the cause which he dedicated his life to.” I really had a lot of animosity. I came from the streets. I was a street thug. And Dr. King was the one that taught me, through his humility and his leadership. I said, that’s the way I’d like to be. “— united will never be defeated. The workers united will never be defeated. The workers united will never be defeated. The workers united will never be defeated.” There are still some unsolved problems need to be solved. “What do we want?” “15.” “When do we want it?” “Now!” “What do we want?” “15.” “When do want it?” “Now!” It is what it is until somebody can roll his sleeves up and get out there and fight.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/learning/lesson-plans/teaching-martin-luther-king-jr.html"}
