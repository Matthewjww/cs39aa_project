Pistols and carbines have traditionally played a role in settling disputes in such Mindanao cities as Davao and Zamboanga.\nBut the situation has worsened. About 800 people were slain in and around Davao last year, nearly twice the number as the year before. Over last weekend, 13 people, including a gambling lord, a peanut vendor and two paramilitary soldiers, were killed in a 24-hour period in Davao.\nThe Government blames most of the killings on the Communists, and Communist assassination squads do roam this big port city.\nThe squads of the Communist guerrillas, the New Peoples Army, are undoubtedly behind many of the killings.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/26/world/killings-soar-in-wild-south-of-the-philippines.html"}
