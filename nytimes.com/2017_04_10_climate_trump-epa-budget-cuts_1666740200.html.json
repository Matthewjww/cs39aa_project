Cuts - The New York Times", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "maintext": "What is at stake as Congress considers the E.P.A. budget? Far more than climate change.\nThe Trump administration’s proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency budget are deep and wide-ranging. It seeks to shrink spending by 31 percent, to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion, and to eliminate a quarter of the agency’s 15,000 jobs.\nThe cuts are so deep that even Republican lawmakers are expected to push back. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the chairwoman of the Interior and Environment Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee, pointedly reminded Mr. Trump last month that his budget request was just “the first step in a long process.”\nHere are some proposed cuts that are likely to face resistance when the budget reaches Congress.\nTap water\nFlint, Mich., is still reeling from its tainted water crisis, and unsafe levels of lead have turned up in tap water in city after city. Still, the E.P.A. is looking to decrease grants that help states monitor public water systems by almost a third, to $71 million from $102 million, according to an internal agency memo first obtained by The Washington Post.\nThe Public Water System Supervision Grant Program has been critical in making sure communities have access to safe drinking water. In Texas, for example, state-contracted workers collect drinking water samples across the state, an effort funded in part by federal grants.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/climate/trump-epa-budget-cuts.html"}
