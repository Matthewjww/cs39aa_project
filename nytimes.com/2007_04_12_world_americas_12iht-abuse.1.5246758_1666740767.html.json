Though the documents represent a small fraction of all claims filed by civilians in those two war zones, the paperwork, examined by The New York Times, provides unusually detailed accounts of how bystanders to the conflict have been killed, injured or had their homes or possessions destroyed.\n\"They held up the fish in the air and shouted 'Fish! Fish!' to show they meant no harm,\" said an army report on the February 2006 incident involving the fishermen. When an American shore patrol drove up, \"the deceased bent over to turn the motor off of the boat, but the C.F. shot him in the head as he bent down,\" the report said, using shorthand for coalition forces, in this case for members of the 101st Airborne Division.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/world/americas/12iht-abuse.1.5246758.html"}
