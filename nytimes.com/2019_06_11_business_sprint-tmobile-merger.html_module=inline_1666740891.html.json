But on Tuesday, the plan hit a roadblock when a group of state attorneys general sued to block it.\nThe 10 officials who filed suit, all of them Democrats, said on Tuesday that if the merger went through, the prices consumers paid for phone plans would rise as the number of major wireless carriers dropped to three from four.\nT-Mobile, the nationâ€™s third-largest wireless company, and Sprint, the No. 4 carrier, have insisted they must get bigger to serve their customers better. A merger would reshape the telecommunications industry in the United States and create a formidable rival to the industry leaders, AT&T and Verizon, with each of the three serving roughly a third of the market.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/business/sprint-tmobile-merger.html?module=inline"}
