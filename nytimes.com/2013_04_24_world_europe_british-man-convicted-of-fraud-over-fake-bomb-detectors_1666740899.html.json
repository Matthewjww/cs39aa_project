The businessman, James McCormick, 56, was described in court as having made more than $75 million from sales of the fake device in Iraq and Georgia, among other places, claiming they could detect bombs, drugs, currency and ivory, and track objects up to 3,280 feet below ground. The devices, sold for up to $40,000 each, had no working electronics and were completely useless. They were widely used at checkpoints in Iraq, giving a false sense of security. An Iraqi general, Jihad al-Jabiri, former head of the Baghdad bomb squad, has been jailed in the scam, along with other police officials.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/world/europe/british-man-convicted-of-fraud-over-fake-bomb-detectors.html"}
