Officials cautioned that no firm conclusions had been drawn and did not reveal any direct evidence of a connection.\nA senior Iraqi official said the attackers had carried forged American identity cards and American-style M-4 rifles and had thrown stun grenades of a kind used only by American forces here.\nTying Iran to the deadly attack could be helpful to the Bush administration, which has been engaged in an escalating war of words with Iran.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/world/middleeast/31karbala.html"}
