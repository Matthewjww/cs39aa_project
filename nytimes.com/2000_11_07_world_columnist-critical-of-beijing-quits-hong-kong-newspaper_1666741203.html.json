That combination, ticklish in the best of times, proved combustible today as Mr. Lam and his newspaper parted company.\nMr. Lam resigned as a columnist and editor at The South China Morning Post because, he said, the paper's Hong Kong owner would no longer tolerate his reporting of behind-the-scenes politics in Beijing.\nLast Thursday, Mr. Lam was stripped of his duties as China editor, though he was told he could keep writing the column. That came less than five months after Mr. Lam was publicly chided for one of his columns by The Post's owner, Robert Kuok, in a scorching letter to the editor.\n''For me, it was like the emperor had spoken,'' Mr. Lam, 48, said in an interview. ''The writing was on the wall.''", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/07/world/columnist-critical-of-beijing-quits-hong-kong-newspaper.html"}
