The service will compete with sites like Facebook and Twitter, which are capturing an increasing percentage of the time people spend online.\nThe links shared on those social networks are also sending a growing amount of traffic to sites across the Web, potentially weakening Google’s position as the prime navigation tool on the Internet.\nSeparately, Facebook plans to announce on Wednesday that it is improving the live chat service on its site by allowing it to be integrated into other services like AIM, AOL’s instant messaging network, which is among the most popular in the United States.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/technology/internet/10social.html"}
