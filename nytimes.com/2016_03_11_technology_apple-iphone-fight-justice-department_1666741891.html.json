The fight has been brewing since mid-February, when Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California ordered Apple to create and deploy an alternative operating system that would help law enforcement agents break into the iPhone in the San Bernardino case.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/11/technology/apple-iphone-fight-justice-department.html"}
