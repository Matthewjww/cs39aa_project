That is partly because of the novel coronavirus itself. Many kids recognize that the virus is formidable; it has upended the world around them for the past several months and unleashed a steady drumbeat of scary news.\nAnd the test is very uncomfortable. Nurses take a cotton swab and capture cells far inside the nose, which lasts a few seconds and often hurts. When children wiggle their bodies or shake their heads, they will likely experience more significant pain. Some facilities require the test to be done in a drive-up setting to minimize person-to-person contact. In those scenarios, the test is often done while a child is sitting in the back seat of a car, and conducted by a nurse who is not only cocooned in protective gear but also reaching through a half-open rear window.\n“Nurses are rightly concerned with physical safety during tests and procedures, but we also have to worry about emotional safety,” Stephens said. “A lot of little minor insults can add up to long-term emotional harm that makes people afraid to go to the doctor, and affects overall medical compliance.”\nResearch shows that nerve-racking medical tests and interventions can affect children psychologically. For example, a study found that 10 percent of adults abstain from medical procedures involving needles, such as vaccinations, because of poor experiences they had as a child.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/parenting/kids-covid-19-test.html"}
