He was 33 years old.\nMr. Bangs was a stylist who reflected directly the energy and wild rebellion of rock-and-roll, attempting to evoke through his prose the energy and spirit of the music itself.\nHis first piece on rock appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in 1969, and in 1971 he dropped out of college to move to Detroit, where he served as a principal editor of Creem for five years.\nMr. Bangs also pursued an active freelance career, which expanded after he moved to New York in 1976. He wrote above all for The Village Voice, but also for London's New Musical Express, Stereo Review, Musician Player and Listener and many other publications.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/obituaries/lester-bangs-33-rock-critic-for-many-publications-dies.html"}
