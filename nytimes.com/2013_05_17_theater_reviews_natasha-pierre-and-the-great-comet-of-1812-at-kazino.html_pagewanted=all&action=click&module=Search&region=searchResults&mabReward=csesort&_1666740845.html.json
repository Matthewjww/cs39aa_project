But the roiling sounds of battle do not intrude on the romantic drama unfolding before us in Dave Malloy’s freshly imagined pop opera, which opened on Thursday night at a custom-built cabaret called Kazino, in the meatpacking district.\nThe clash of cutlery, on the other hand, occasionally echoes as Tolstoy’s tale of love, corruption and fateful meetings swirls like a feverish dream before us, above us, around us. Following its acclaimed, sellout run last fall at Ars Nova, the production has been given a stylish and sumptuous upgrade, and now comes with a full meal attached.\nThe show is performed in an elaborately appointed salon, with claret-colored velvet draperies and period paintings adorning the walls. Spiky candelabras modeled on the starbursts at the Metropolitan Opera twinkle from above. (Mimi Lien’s set designs form a crucial part of the mise-en-scène.) The audience sits at tables and banquettes clustered tightly together. Dinner service begins an hour before the performance. (The Broadway-size price tag is $125, but on Broadway you don’t get borscht.) For those who truly want to enter into the spirit of the drama, carafes of vodka can be purchased.\nYes, bottle service has come to Off Broadway. (Where more appropriately than in the meatpacking district?) I suspect it was inevitable: audiences are flocking to productions that dispense entirely with the theater’s traditional fourth wall and provide nightclub-style amenities. Punchdrunk’s “Sleep No More,” which allows patrons to dawdle for a drink before, during and after the show, remains a hot ticket. (One of its producers is among the presenters of “Natasha.”) The interactive musical “Here Lies Love,” at the Public Theater, invites the audience to boogie on down with Imelda Marcos and friends.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/theater/reviews/natasha-pierre-and-the-great-comet-of-1812-at-kazino.html?pagewanted=all&action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults&mabReward=csesort&"}
