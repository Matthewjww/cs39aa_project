Prime Minister Ali Zeidan called the supposed coup “ridiculous.” A military spokesman called it “a lie.” None of the Libyan Army’s few tanks or soldiers made any visible moves. The empty Parliament was quiet.\nIt was the latest evidence of the long shadow cast across the region by the military takeover in Cairo last summer that was announced by Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, then an army general. The attempted imitation in Libya, though, demonstrated the limits of the Egyptian example.\nWhile Egypt’s military ushered out President Hosni Mubarak three years ago and dominated the political transition, the Libyan military never had much cohesion even under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and it had splintered long before his ouster.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/world/middleeast/in-libya-a-coup-or-perhaps-not.html"}
