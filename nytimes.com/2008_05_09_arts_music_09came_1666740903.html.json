Actually the staging is fairly elaborate.\nThe cast performs atop a makeshift raked platform that extends into the Avery Fisher Hall auditorium, covering about half a dozen rows of seats up front, with the orchestra of nearly 60 performing from the rear of the stage. At one point a circular section of the platform rises dramatically to become the round table where the idealistic King Arthur gathers his legendary knights.\nWith colorful costumes, rosters of dancers and thrusting sword-fight scenes, the production, directed by Lonny Price and choreographed by Josh Prince, is no less intricate than, say, the staging for the Broadway hit “Chicago.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/arts/music/09came.html"}
