Tim Walz of Minnesota tried on Friday to channel the anger of people enraged over the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police.\n“The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish, unheard,” Mr. Walz said, looking visibly shaken at a news conference in St. Paul.\nGesticulating forcefully out of evident frustration, the governor called Mr. Floyd’s death on Monday, and the smoldering unrest in Minneapolis that has come after it, “one of our darkest chapters.” Mr. Floyd, 46, died after a police officer pressed his knee down on Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes.\nFriday’s news conference was a critical moment in the national spotlight for Mr. Walz, a Democrat, the morning after peaceful protests against the Minneapolis Police Department turned into looting and firebombing that burned down a police precinct.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/us/tim-walz-minnesota-governor.html"}
