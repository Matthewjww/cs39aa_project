It was the final week of filming for “Between the World and Me,” a television special based on Ta-Nehisi Coates’s memoir, a meditation on the history and lived experience of Black people in America.\nNear the park’s Ramble, an actress dressed as Amy Cooper — the white woman who in May called emergency services to complain, fraudulently, that a Black bird-watcher had threatened her — played with a three-legged dog. A Covid coordinator distributed nitrile gloves and squirts from a tub of hand sanitizer. Hairdressers and makeup artists hovered in plastic ponchos and face shields. A production assistant safeguarded a wheeled cart piled with camera equipment.\nOfficials from the Central Park Conservancy, two of whom stood muttering nearby, had approved the shoot with the stipulation that it not block any pathways. So other assistants had to urge passers-by not to walk in front of the camera. At least a dozen people, mostly white, refused, disinclined to allow the production team — mostly people of color, mostly women — to claim the space they needed. Which felt like a metaphor.\n“Between the World and Me,” an amalgam of animation, music, archival video and monologues, will premiere on HBO on Saturday. An 80-minute special with a superlative cast — Oprah Winfrey! Mahershala Ali! Angela Davis! — it has the grave and unenviable responsibility of illuminating the violence of systemic racism for millions of potential viewers. It asks of them all, even the ones who won’t get out of the way, what the book’s narrator asks of his son: to become conscious citizens of this beautiful and terrible world.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/arts/television/between-the-world-and-me-hbo.html"}
