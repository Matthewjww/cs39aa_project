It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.\nBut the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder, but not as a hate crime.\nThe announcement outraged Asian-American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan district attorney’s office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by the authorities.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/nyregion/asian-hate-crimes.html"}
