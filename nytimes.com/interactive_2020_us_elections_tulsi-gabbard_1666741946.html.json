She generally does not endorse meddling with dictators; she thinks the threat from Russia is severely exaggerated; she wants to stop beating the drums of war with Iran; and she would prefer to make nice with North Korea. “We should be coming to other leaders in other countries with respect, building a relationship based on cooperation rather than with, you know, a police baton,” she told The New York Times.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/tulsi-gabbard.html"}
