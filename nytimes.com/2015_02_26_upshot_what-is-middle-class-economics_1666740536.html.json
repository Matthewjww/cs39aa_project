So, the president has picked an opportune time to set his mantra to “middle-class economics”: a time when middle-class economic fortunes are already improving for reasons not much related to policy.\nThe last year has been the first really good year for the middle class since the crisis. Job growth has risen to a pace of more than three million jobs a year, and gasoline prices are through the floor. Consumer confidence is at levels not seen since 2007. Wage growth is still not strong but is better than it has been in years, and moves by a few large employers — including Walmart, which announced a $9 wage floor that would rise to $10 next year — may be signs that broad-based wage increases will come soon.\nThe big challenge for President Obama — and for Republicans seeking their own agenda to woo the middle class — is that middle-income economic fortunes are driven mostly by private employers. The government can raise the minimum wage, but it can’t make employers raise wages for workers already making well above that. It can give out targeted tax cuts, but these can’t have large effects on the average family’s income without getting really expensive. It can impose labor regulations, but it cannot overcome the fact that employers are powerful when many workers chase a small number of jobs.\nThis is a real contrast to the economic situation of the poor, which the Obama administration has affected greatly through policy. Between 2007 and 2012, the share of Americans who would have been poor based on their income before taxes and transfers rose by five percentage points. But after adjusting for taxes and transfers, poverty rose by just a point. Programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance were highly effective in stopping the sharp rise in unemployment from turning into a sharp rise in poverty. Most of that policy effect was automatic, but a considerable portion was due to specific policy initiatives of the president, such as extending unemployment insurance benefits.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/26/upshot/what-is-middle-class-economics.html"}
