Vallone, celebrating the completion of his first year as the City Council's majority leader, underlined his effort to become a major citywide political figure by delivering the first State of the City Council address yesterday.\nThe address by Mr. Vallone, a Queens Democrat regarded as a possible mayoral candidate, offered few initiatives for the new year. He did renew his call for stripping the City Board of Estimate of its budget powers, although he did not say precisely how he would pursue that goal.\nIn his speech, he detailed how the Council, long viewed as a handmaiden of the Mayor, had tried to assert itself in 1986. He cited the adding of new committees and subcommittees, the creation of an investigative unit and a department for policy and research, and a sharp increase in the Council's staff.\nHe also mentioned the opening of a two-person City Council office in Albany and said he planned to have a similar office opened in Washington.
