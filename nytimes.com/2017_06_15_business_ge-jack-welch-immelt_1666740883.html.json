Immelt, would step down as G.E.’s chief executive, the verdict would appear to be in.\n“Given how horrendous the stock performance has been for so many years, the most amazing thing is why the board didn’t act sooner” to replace Mr. Immelt, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/business/ge-jack-welch-immelt.html"}
