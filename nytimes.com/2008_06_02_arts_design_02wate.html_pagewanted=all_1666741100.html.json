See how Governors Island fades in the rain?”\nIt seemed fitting that Mr. Eliasson, a Danish-Icelandic artist who is world-famous for creating his own weather systems, was enveloped in a misty landscape that could well have been of his own making.\nHe had traveled straight from the airport to Pier 35 on the East River after flying in from his home and studio in Berlin. He has been a familiar presence at the site for the last several months, having visited every two weeks to check on the progress of his “New York City Waterfalls.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/arts/design/02wate.html?pagewanted=all"}
