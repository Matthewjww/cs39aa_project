Gallucci, said the two sides had signed a separate confidential document that is more specific than the four-page \"agreed framework\" that was made public after its signing at the North Korean mission to the United Nations here.\nHe insisted that the secret document was consistent with the main agreement and would be made available on a confidential basis to senior members of Congress. \"Documents of this sort are not unusual in international agreements,\" he added.\nMr. Gallucci implied but would not say North Korea had asked that parts of the agreement not be divulged. \"We agreed to respect the confidentiality of this document,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/22/world/us-and-north-korea-sign-pact-to-end-nuclear-dispute.html"}
