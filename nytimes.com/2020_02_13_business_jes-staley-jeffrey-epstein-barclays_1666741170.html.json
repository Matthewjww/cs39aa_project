Staley, had described to bank officials his ties with Mr. Epstein, the financier who killed himself in August after facing new allegations of sex trafficking of underage girls.\nMr. Staley, one of a handful of prominent Wall Street financiers who have been linked to Mr. Epstein, said he had been fully forthcoming about their relationship, which he said had ended before he arrived at the bank five years ago.\n“I feel very comfortable, going back to 2015, I have been transparent and open with the bank,” he said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. Mr. Staley did not respond to messages seeking comment.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/business/jes-staley-jeffrey-epstein-barclays.html"}
