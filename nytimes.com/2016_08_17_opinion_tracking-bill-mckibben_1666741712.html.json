Not so. We are simply trying to bring transparency to a leading public figure and liberal activist who played a key role in writing the Democratic Party’s 2016 platform.\nVideo tracking was pioneered by liberal activists and is now such standard practice across the political spectrum that Mr. McKibben’s own organization, 350.org, conducts “boot camps,” training activists to do it.\nMy group tracks only campaign-style events that are open to the public. Our footage of Mr. McKibben in a church pew was taken at an open political forum, not a religious service.\nGiven Mr. McKibben’s offensive rhetoric — saying a proper response to 9/11 would have been a $1 gas tax, for example — it is understandable why he would be uncomfortable with close scrutiny.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/opinion/tracking-bill-mckibben.html"}
