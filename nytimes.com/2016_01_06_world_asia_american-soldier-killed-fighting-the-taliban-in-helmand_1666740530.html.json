The American casualties came during a push by Afghan and American soldiers to clear territory between Marja and the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, according to Afghan military officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the news media.\nLater, Afghan and American officials said an American helicopter had sustained damage in the area, but they disagreed on the details. In Washington, American officials said that a medical evacuation helicopter had been sent to Marja to help the wounded soldiers and that its rotors had struck the wall of a compound there. It was unclear whether the wounded soldiers had yet been evacuated.\nBut one Afghan military official said that an American Black Hawk transport helicopter had gone down in enemy territory because of a mechanical problem, and that the casualties had come afterward. There were no further details or confirming accounts.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/world/asia/american-soldier-killed-fighting-the-taliban-in-helmand.html"}
