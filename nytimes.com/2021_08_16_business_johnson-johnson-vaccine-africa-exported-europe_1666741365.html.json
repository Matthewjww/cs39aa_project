And the vaccine would be produced in part by a South African manufacturer, raising hopes that those doses would quickly go to Africans.\nThat has not happened.\nSouth Africa is still waiting to receive the overwhelming majority of the 31 million vaccine doses it ordered from Johnson & Johnson. It has administered only about two million Johnson & Johnson shots. That is a key reason that fewer than 7 percent of South Africans are fully vaccinated — and that the country was devastated by the Delta variant.\nAt the same time, Johnson & Johnson has been exporting millions of doses that were bottled and packaged in South Africa for distribution in Europe, according to executives at Johnson & Johnson and the South African manufacturer, Aspen Pharmacare, as well as South African government export records reviewed by The New York Times.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/16/business/johnson-johnson-vaccine-africa-exported-europe.html"}
