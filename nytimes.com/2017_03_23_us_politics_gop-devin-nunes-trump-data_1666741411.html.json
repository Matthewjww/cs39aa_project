He said at a news conference that he had briefed Speaker Paul D. Ryan and planned to inform Mr. Trump. The top Democrat on the panel, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, was notably absent.\nDemocrats said that the disclosure by Mr. Nunes, who served on Mr. Trump’s transition team, was intended to throw a lifeline to the president after his unfounded claim that President Barack Obama had tapped his phones during the election. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, said Mr. Nunes had either been manipulated by Mr. Trump or been “a willing stooge.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/us/politics/gop-devin-nunes-trump-data.html"}
