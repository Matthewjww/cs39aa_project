This is The Daily. On Monday night, Russian troops crossed into two key regions in eastern Ukraine, controlled by forces friendly to Russia in a possible precursor to a wider war.\nlynsey addario\nThis is Lynsey Addario in the village of Nova Luhansk. We’re being shelled right — we’re lying face down.\nsabrina tavernise\nThe day before, I landed in Kyiv, the country’s capital, and joined my colleagues who’ve been reporting from the ground.\nspeaker A train is expected to depart full with refugees fleeing what —\nsabrina tavernise\nThey’ve been in the east sending dispatches about rising tensions there.\nspeaker It does feel like from the Russian side a kind of case for going to war is being established, even though the public at large here, I think, is really just not prepared for this kind of war.\nsabrina tavernise\nToday: I spoke to one of those colleagues, Valerie Hopkins, about what led to this moment and what’s coming next. It’s Tuesday, February 22. Valerie, so I arrived in Kyiv on Sunday. And it’s turned out to be a very significant weekend in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Walk me through where this most recent escalation began. Where did it start?\nvalerie hopkins\nSo it all starts in this region of Eastern Ukraine called Donbass, where pro-Moscow forces have been in charge since March 2014. They violently took control of the government and set about trying to create their own statelet.\nsabrina tavernise\nI remember that fighting really well. Because I covered that war pretty extensively in 2014. And it was really violent at first. But then it just settled into this slow, grinding rhythm.\nvalerie hopkins\nWell, exactly. After that, the fighters on both sides dug into their positions. Sometimes they lobbed mortars back and forth. People did die. But it was really slow burning. But starting on Thursday, it started to feel different. Thursday morning, we started to see reports that there was intensified shelling on the front line. And the shelling hit a kindergarten and a civilian school and actually injured some ordinary people. And by the time my colleague got there, it became clear that that wasn’t the only place being shelled, that there was actually shelling all across the front line. So by Thursday evening, it became clear that this was a serious escalation. And the shelling only intensified on Friday. Artillery shells were hitting civilian targets. My colleague, Andrew Kramer, was on the front line interviewing civilians who said they had been hiding in basements, hiding their babies and very scared of an escalation. And at the same time, the U.S. increased their estimate of Russian troops, putting it at 190,000 Russian troops in and around Ukraine’s borders. And then there was a series of events that dramatically raised the stakes.\nvalerie hopkins I am in the Kyiv neighborhood of Podil. I was on my way to go and check out some of the 4,000 plus areas for shelter, like bomb shelters, when there was just an explosion announced in Donetsk. So I canceled my plans. I’m on my way back to see if I can figure out what’s going on. Right now, it looks like it was just a car bomb. But the Russian media is playing it big —\nvalerie hopkins\nReports that began to emerge that a car bomb had gone off in the center of Donetsk, this self-proclaimed capital of the secessionist republic. And there were reports that this was the car belonging to the chief of the security services there. Rumors immediately began to spread on social media channels that were loyal to these Moscow-backed leaders, saying that this was evidence of a Ukrainian attempt to escalate tensions and invade. In the other Republic, the Luhansk People’s Republic, there were reports that a gas pipeline had exploded, which would be very damaging. And within hours, both leaders announced that all of the civilians, all of the women and children living in these two republics, needed to be evacuated immediately, urgently to Russia.\nsabrina tavernise\nWow, so those are three things — bam, bam, bam — right in a row.\nvalerie hopkins\nYes. And everything was happening so fast. As my colleagues and I were trying to confirm the car bombing, shortly thereafter, there was news of this pipeline explosion. We can’t get into these separatist republics. Because they have a very strict vetting process for journalists. And they do not want us poking around there to see what was happening. But we were already looking out for signs of what is called a “false-flag operation.” The White House and the State Department have been warning for weeks, if not months, that part of any buildup to a further Russian invasion of Ukraine would involve a false flag attack, which is something that would be designed by Russia, but engineered to look like it had been perpetrated by Ukraine. And when we started looking into these incidents, it turned out that this car did not actually belong to the security chief. And this video that was circulating widely of the gas explosion was actually something from a totally separate incident that happened in July.\nsabrina tavernise\nOh wow, so months before.\nvalerie hopkins\nYeah, but the people were being evacuated nonetheless. And you know, I’ve been in Moscow watching all of the news for the last few months. And the state-owned channels have been preparing the Russian people for a possible war by showing images of suffering citizens in these two separatist republics. They’ve been talking about — even using the word genocide against what Putin estimates to be four million people living in these two territories, and anything that would allow them to show that there was this suffering of their people and a humanitarian crisis that they need to step in and protect. And that’s exactly what we could see from the images that started to emerge on Friday night of civilians, women and children trickling over the border in buses, being put up in hastily improvised tent camps, sleeping all together hundreds of people on cots. The images are quite alarming. But the problem is that the Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied any plan to attack this territory, any plan to further inflame tensions. And while we’re frantically trying to confirm these reports —\narchived recording (joe biden) Today, I made two vital calls.\nvalerie hopkins\n— President Joe Biden addresses the American people.\narchived recording (joe biden) We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to and intend to attack Ukraine in the coming week, the coming days. We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people. We’re calling out Russia’s plans loudly and repeatedly, not because we want a conflict, but because we’re doing everything in our power to remove any reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine and prevent them from moving. reporter Mr. President, to be clear, you are convinced —\nvalerie hopkins\nI’ve just watched Joe Biden say that he believes that Putin has made a decision to invade and that that includes attacking Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million people. And I’m — I don’t know what to say. I think a lot of people in Kyiv and in the rest of the country will not really be sleeping well tonight. [MUSIC]\nsabrina tavernise\nSo what happens next?\nvalerie hopkins\nSo on Saturday morning, I woke up after not a lot of sleep following Biden’s comments and got on a Ukrainian military plane to go to the east and see the front line for myself. And we flew to the east. And then we got into a military convoy heading to the region of Svitlodarsk, which is one of the last towns along the front line separating sort of Ukrainian held territory from no man’s land held by the separatists. And we were accompanying a delegation of Ukrainian ministers and parliamentarians who were also visiting the front line in a show of solidarity and as part of a fact-finding mission. And I was with a group that was led by a party leader from President Zelensky’s party who had, like President Zelensky, really been tamping down any kind of comments, especially American comments, that a war was imminent, that Putin had made up his mind to invade.\nspeaker 1 My family stays in Ukraine. Everybody’s in Ukraine. We live normal lives. We have no extra security measures and so on. interviewer 1 Six kids? speaker 1 Six kids, right. interviewer 1 In Kyiv? speaker 1 In Kyiv. interviewer 1 And you’re not moving? speaker 1 Not moving. interviewer 2 You were yourself a refugee.\nvalerie hopkins\nSo with him and a small group of other international journalists —\nspeaker We will divide in two groups. One is in Svitlodarsk.\nvalerie hopkins\n— we went to a tiny military outpost that was in the village of Nova Luhansk that had been shelled that morning. And actually, one of the mortars that had come over from the separatist fire had injured one soldier whose arm would have to be amputated. And I interviewed the commander of this local post, which before the war was just a place where they repaired old tractors. And he basically said, this has been happening. This is going to continue to happen. We are not returning fire. We are just going to endure it. Because we cannot afford any kind of pretext or any kind of messaging that we’re involved in this. And also, we don’t want to damage the civilians on the other side. The Ukrainian government still hopes and maintains an aspiration that they will reincorporate this territory, the separatist-held territory, back into Ukraine. It’s about 7% of the country. So they showed us these holes in the ground where the mortars had fallen. And we had a short conversation. And then they told us it was time to go.\nspeaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\nAnd there was this intense rush. It wasn’t clear to me what was really going on. But they said, you need to get out of here right now.\nspeaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\nSo we jumped into the car that was being driven by this 28-year-old soldier, Deniz. And he just floored it. And almost immediately, on the place where we had just been standing 10 seconds before, we could hear an explosion.\n[explosion] [scream] speaker 1 No, go, go. [EXPLETIVE], dude. speaker 2 What’s going on with all of you? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\nAnd then another one.\n[explosion] speaker Yeah, there’s shelling over there.\nvalerie hopkins\nAnd then another one.\nvalerie hopkins That’s the fourth one since we arrived.\nvalerie hopkins\nAnd Deniz was just saying, just be calm. It’s going to be OK. Be calm. And he was just driving as fast as he could over these potholed roads to get us out of there as more and more shells started going off.\n[explosion] And then we got back into the town. And we went straight into a Ukrainian military facility, where we had to seek cover as more shells rained down. valerie hopkins The shelling has just continued to intensify. It’s not stopping. I think I’ve counted eight since we drove away so far.\nvalerie hopkins\nAnd it later emerged that my group was not the only group that had to run and hide from this fire. Another group of journalists accompanying the defense minister also had to seek cover when they came under fire. And all of this is happening as the world is watching Ukraine and also watching Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, leave the country the day after President Biden said Russia was poised to attack, and go to the Munich Security Conference, where he delivered a speech, where he basically said, Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world says it doesn’t want to fight. And Russia says it doesn’t want to attack. Someone is lying. [MUSIC]\nsabrina tavernise\nWe’ll be right back. So Valerie, what happened after that day of intense shelling?\nvalerie hopkins\nWell, on Sunday, there was another ominous sign.\narchived recording [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\nThe Belarusian Ministry of Defense announced that due to the unrest in eastern Ukraine, military exercises that have been going on — joint military exercises, in Belarus with Russian troops, which were scheduled to end on Sunday — would be extended indefinitely. And this for all of us who were watching caused great alarm. Everyone had been looking at Sunday as the day that could prove decisive. Because we had repeatedly heard from Russians, and also from the Belarusian leader, that once the exercises were over, the troops would go home. And this was an ominous announcement with no end date that the troops are going to stay there. I mean, it’s Russia’s biggest international deployment of troops since the end of the Cold War.\nsabrina tavernise\nHmm.\nvalerie hopkins\nUkraine has a very long border with Belarus. And not only that, but some of the exercises were very close to Belarus’s border with Ukraine. And that’s only about 150 kilometers away from the capital of Kyiv.\nsabrina tavernise\nOK, so from what you’ve told me, you’re seeing Russian separatists firing shells to the Ukrainian side. And then the Ukrainians you’re talking to are saying they’re not firing back, because they can’t afford to escalate the fight with Russia. Yet Russia’s using the unrest in the East, unrest that appears to be completely driven by Russian separatists, as a reason to keep its troops on the ground in Belarus.\nvalerie hopkins\nYes. The Ukrainians are pointing out actually that we haven’t seen any credible evidence of civilians in either of these two separatist-held territories being killed. But reporting by me and my colleagues on the ground has shown that there are soldiers and civilians being shelled and even killed almost every day on the Ukrainian-held side of the territory. On Monday, my colleague Andrew Kramer documented one area near the separatist region that had just been hit by 12 mortar shells.\nandrew kramer I’m in the village of Vrubivka in the aftermath of a mortar or artillery strike earlier today. And the windows in some of the houses around have been blown out. There are branches on the ground. People are sweeping up glass.\nvalerie hopkins\nHe visited a woman.\nwoman [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\nAnd when he spoke to her, she was so anxious. She was totally shook up. You know, and she showed him a video that she made while the shelling was going on.\nwoman [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\nYou can see how scared she is.\nwoman [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [explosion]\nvalerie hopkins\nAt a certain point, she falls down.\nwoman [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\nAt another point —\n[close explosion] woman [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\n— the whole video just goes black. And you can hear her calling out for her mom. And she says —\nwoman [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]\nvalerie hopkins\n— I’m sure they’ve hit. They’ve hit us. They’ve hit my house. [MUSIC] And then —\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\n— later in the day, Putin delivered a fiery, hour-long speech about Ukraine.\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\nYou know, he’s expressing all of his grievances against Ukraine.\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\nHe’s expressing why he basically thinks that Ukraine doesn’t really deserve to exist as an independent state.\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\nHe’s saying it’s a creation of Soviet leaders. And, you know, he starts trying to lay out an argument for why Ukraine is actually not a great place to live and why throwing your lot in with the West is not what Ukraine should be doing.\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\nAnd near the end, he pointed to these eastern regions, where there’s been so much unrest and where thousands of people have been evacuated in the last five days. He accused the government in Kyiv of not honoring these people’s wish to speak Russian in their native language. And he essentially said —\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\n— that the government in Kyiv was committing a genocide against these four million people while the West turned away and pretended that it didn’t know about it. And that was why he said —\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\n— he would honor the request of the two separatist leaders to recognize them as independent republics and signed a decree with both of them present, recognizing them.\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nsabrina tavernise\nAnd what did you make of that?\nvalerie hopkins\nWell, we were all wondering what it could mean. And we got a partial answer less than an hour later, when the Kremlin announced it had ordered Russia’s defense ministry to deploy what they were calling peacekeepers into the two republics whose independence Putin had just recognized. [MUSIC]\nsabrina tavernise\nSo if there was any question about what the last four days were building toward, it sure seems like now at 1:39 a.m. in Kyiv, that they were building toward what looks like an invasion.\nvalerie hopkins\nAbsolutely. As we speak, Russian soldiers are rolling in to what constitutes 7% of Ukraine’s territory. And we don’t really know what they’re going to do next. We don’t know if they’re going to stay there. We don’t know if this is the beginning of a long-feared, full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. But if this escalates, and if this results in a full invasion, it’s going to be the largest military action in Europe since World War II. And we don’t know where this is going to stop. But in Putin’s speech, he made it clear that this is about more than just these territories in the East.\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\nvalerie hopkins\nHe said that if the Ukrainian side did not de-escalate, the complete responsibility for the possibility of a continuation of bloodshed would be fully and wholly on the conscience of the regime ruling the territory of Ukraine. And that sitting here in Kyiv has sent shivers down my spine and I think down the spines of many of the people watching that. [MUSIC]\nsabrina tavernise\nValerie, thank you.\nvalerie hopkins\nThank you, Sabrina. [MUSIC]\nsabrina tavernise\nOn Monday night, the United States said it would impose economic sanctions on the two regions of Ukraine that Russia has now recognized as independent. But the U.S. stopped short of imposing sanctions directly on Russia, saying it would reserve those penalties for if or when Russia pushes further into Ukraine. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.\narchived recording (boris johnson) So let us learn to live with this virus and continue protecting ourselves and others without restricting our freedoms. And in that spirit, Mr. Speaker, I commend this statement to the house.\nsabrina tavernise\nOn Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ending all of the country’s remaining Covid restrictions and entrusting British citizens to learn to live with the virus.\narchived recording (boris johnson) And Mr. Speaker, it is time that we got our confidence back. We don’t need laws to compel people to be considerate to others. We can rely on that sense of responsibility towards one another.\nsabrina tavernise", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/22/world/russia-ukraine-biden-putin/an-eu-official-says-russian-troops-entered-eastern-ukraine-though-not-a-full-invasion"}
