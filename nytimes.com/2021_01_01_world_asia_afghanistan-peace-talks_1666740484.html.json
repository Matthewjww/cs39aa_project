The most recent round of discussions, which began in September, were riddled with bureaucratic hangups and monthslong debates over minor issues.\nAnd though those talks resulted in an agreement on the principles and procedures that will guide the next round of peace negotiations, they came with a price. While the two sides met in Doha, Qatar, bloodletting on battlefields and in Afghan cities surged.\nThe talks resumed in early January, after a brief recess, but they have been stalled by a diplomatic stalemate amid escalating violence. Both sides are waiting for President Biden to decide whether to keep the remaining 2,500 U.S. forces in Afghanistan beyond the May 1 withdrawal deadline outlined in the February 2020 U.S.-Taliban agreement.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/world/asia/afghanistan-peace-talks.html"}
