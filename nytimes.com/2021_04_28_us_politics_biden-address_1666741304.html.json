Biden Jr. entered the presidency as a deadly pandemic and an economic crisis prevented him from doing any of the parts of the job that might typically be considered among its perks.\nHe cannot review the troops, shake hands along a rope line or host a state dinner for a visiting foreign leader. But on Wednesday night, Mr. Biden finally participated in one sanctified ritual of the presidency: addressing a joint session of Congress.\nThe speech itself was hopeful in tone and ambitious in the scope of Mr. Biden’s proposals.\n“America is on the move again,” the president said, acknowledging that he took office in the middle of the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and what he called the “worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.”\nHere are four takeaways.\nHistory is made with two women on the dais.\nNothing about Mr. Biden’s speech looked like the annual address has in the past, with more brown chairs visible in the audience than masked faces. But the most arresting image of the night had nothing to do with coronavirus precautions. For the first time in history, two women sat on the dais behind the presidential podium.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/us/politics/biden-address.html"}
