A U.S. military jury condemned his treatment as “a stain on the moral fiber of America.”\nJustice Department lawyers described the Biden administration’s efforts to find a place for him in a filing that urged Judge Reggie B. Walton of the U.S. District Court in Washington to essentially take no action for now on Mr. Khan’s petition of habeas corpus.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/us/politics/guantanamo-prisoner-majid-khan.html"}
