The court hears appeals of cases in Manhattan and the Bronx.\nIn a 3-to-2 decision last week, the majority opinion said the judges saw ramifications that extended far beyond the case and referred to complaints about and legal challenges to the New York Police Departmentâ€™s expansive use of stop-and-frisk tactics.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/nyregion/appeals-court-throws-out-2nd-gun-conviction-in-stop-and-frisk-case.html?_r=1&ref=stopandfrisk"}
