Players Association protocols for unvaccinated personnel, is Nov. 13, the day before Green Bay plays the Seattle Seahawks, if he remains asymptomatic. He must sit at least 10 days and test negative twice, with 24 hours between tests.\nRodgers, when asked on Aug. 26 whether he had been vaccinated against Covid-19, responded that he had been “immunized.” NFL Network reported that he is unvaccinated.\nRodgers added, “There’s guys on the team that haven’t been vaccinated. I think it’s a personal decision. I’m not going to judge those guys.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/sports/football/aaron-rodgers-covid-vaccinated-packers.html"}
