''Why?'' was what she was obviously asking herself as she handed me the letter saying she was waitlisted. Why, indeed? She had taken the toughest courses in her high school and had done well, sat through several Saturday mornings taking SAT's and the like, participated in the requisite number of extracurricular activities, written a heartfelt and well-phrased essay and even taken the extra step of touring the campus.", "filename": "2006_03_23_opinion_to-all-the-girls-ive-rejected_1666740647.html", "image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=2006", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/matthewwhite/news-please-repo//data/2022/10/25/nytimes.com/2006_03_23_opinion_to-all-the-girls-ive-rejected_1666740647.html", "title": "To All the Girls I've Rejected", "title_page": "Opinion | To All the Girls I've Rejected - The New York Times", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "maintext": "I was once one of those girls applying to college, but that was 30 years ago, when applying to college was only a tad more difficult than signing up for a membership at the Y. Today, it's a complicated and prolonged dance that begins early, and for young women, there is little margin for error: A grade of C in Algebra II/Trig? Off to the waitlist you go.\nRest assured that admissions officers are not cavalier in making their decisions. Last week, the 10 officers at my college sat around a table, 12 hours every day, deliberating the applications of hundreds of talented young men and women. While gulping down coffee and poring over statistics, we heard about a young woman from Kentucky we were not yet ready to admit outright. She was the leader/president/editor/captain/lead actress in every activity in her school. She had taken six advanced placement courses and had been selected for a prestigious state leadership program. In her free time, this whirlwind of achievement had accumulated more than 300 hours of community service in four different organizations.\nFew of us sitting around the table were as talented and as directed at age 17 as this young woman. Unfortunately, her test scores and grade point average placed her in the middle of our pool. We had to have a debate before we decided to swallow the middling scores and write \"admit\" next to her name.\nHad she been a male applicant, there would have been little, if any, hesitation to admit. The reality is that because young men are rarer, they're more valued applicants. Today, two-thirds of colleges and universities report that they get more female than male applicants, and more than 56 percent of undergraduates nationwide are women. Demographers predict that by 2009, only 42 percent of all baccalaureate degrees awarded in the United States will be given to men.\nWe have told today's young women that the world is their oyster; the problem is, so many of them believed us that the standards for admission to today's most selective colleges are stiffer for women than men. How's that for an unintended consequence of the women's liberation movement?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/opinion/to-all-the-girls-ive-rejected.html"}
