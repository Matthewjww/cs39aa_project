But the new legislation broadens the definition.\n“Now it becomes clear that if both parties do not agree to sex, then it is rape,” Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup said after lawmakers unanimously approved the measure, which takes effect on Jan. 1.\nDenmark regularly leads indexes on gender equality and access to justice. Its sexual assault laws already criminalized marital rape, and the legal definition of rape includes acts other than sexual intercourse.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/world/europe/denmark-rape-law.html"}
