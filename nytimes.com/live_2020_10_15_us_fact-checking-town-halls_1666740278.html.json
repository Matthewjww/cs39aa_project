Over the past week, there have been an average of 53,120 cases per day, an increase of 23 percent from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database.\nAs case numbers rise nationally, outbreaks continue to spread in the Upper Midwest and Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast is seeing early signs of a resurgence. The numbers are deeply concerning to public health officials. In an interview this week, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said he has long been concerned that the daily caseload has never dipped significantly below 20,000.\n“And now it’s kind of going back and forth between 40 and 50,000 cases a day,” Dr. Fauci said. “I have said many times, and I’ll say it again, that that is not a good position to be in as you enter the cooler months of the fall and the colder months of the winter.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/15/us/fact-checking-town-halls"}
