The group also called for schools, shops and workers to go on strike on Monday.\nTens of thousands of demonstrators opposed to the bill surrounded the Legislative Council building on Wednesday and prevented lawmakers from meeting as planned to move the legislation on an accelerated schedule toward a vote next week. When some protesters charged the police in an attempt to enter the building, riot control officers opened fire with rubber bullets and more than 150 canisters of tear gas.\nAlmost all the protesters dispersed overnight, and an uneasy and perhaps temporary calm returned to the streets of Hong Kong on Thursday. The government closed its main offices and security remained tight around the Legislative Council Complex. As thunderstorms rolled across the city, trash crews cleared away surgical masks, water bottles and other debris from the clashes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html"}
