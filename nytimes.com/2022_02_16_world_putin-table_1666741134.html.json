Within two years, he said his company provided wooden paneling, doors, sofas, tables and marble fireplaces for the room where Mr. Putin has been meeting with leaders, as well as for other rooms and the building’s upper floor, which is a private residence for the president.\nMr. Pologna said the 20-foot-long table is made of seasoned beech hardwood, lacquered with water-based paint and decorated with gold leaves. Just the top weighs about 770 pounds, he said.\nMr. Zaragozá, who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, told the radio station that the table was “made of wood from the Alps, from trees that grow in the shadows, because when trees grow in the sun, they grow in a hurry.” He said that his company supplied the Kremlin between 2002 and 2006.\nMr. Pologna said Mr. Zaragozá could not have built the original table because it appeared in a book published in Russia in 2000 with pictures from the Kremlin’s palace and provided an image from the book.\nThe Kremlin could not immediately clear up the issue.\nThe furniture makers have extensive résumés. Mr. Zaragozá’s company has produced furniture for other big clients in the former Soviet Union, including designing a dining room for the president of Uzbekistan. Mr. Pologna said that he has furnished the palaces of Malaysian sultans, the private residences of Arab royal families and did some work for Saddam Hussein in the early days of his government.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/world/putin-table.html"}
