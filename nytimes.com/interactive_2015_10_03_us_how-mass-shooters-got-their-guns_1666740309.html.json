At the time of the shootings, he was not a subject in any investigation, nor did he have a documented mental health issue.\nMarch 2008 Mr. Wong bought the first gun, the Beretta 92, at a store in Johnson City, N.Y. He passed a background check.\nMarch 2009 Mr. Wong bought the second gun from the same store, but his background check was not approved immediately. He received the gun under a federal rule that allows a gun to be sold if the background check system does not return a decision in three business days.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html"}
