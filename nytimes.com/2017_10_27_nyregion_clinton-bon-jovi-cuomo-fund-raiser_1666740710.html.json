Andrew M. Cuomo is throwing a big fund-raiser to celebrate his 60th birthday and he is enlisting Bill Clinton and Jon Bon Jovi to help him bring in campaign money for his 2018 re-election.\nChairs of the host committee for the Dec. 14 event are being asked to contribute at least $50,000, according to an invitation obtained by The New York Times.\nFor $50,000, donors will receive a “premier table” for 10, plus three tickets to a private reception with Mr. Cuomo. Co-chairs are asked to donate $25,000 for a 10-person “preferred” table that includes two reception tickets.\nIndividual tickets are $1,000 for “general seating” at the event, to be held at the restaurant Cipriani Wall Street, which once housed the New York Stock Exchange and describes itself as “a triumph of Greek Revival architecture.” There is also a $150 “young professional” ticket.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/nyregion/clinton-bon-jovi-cuomo-fund-raiser.html"}
