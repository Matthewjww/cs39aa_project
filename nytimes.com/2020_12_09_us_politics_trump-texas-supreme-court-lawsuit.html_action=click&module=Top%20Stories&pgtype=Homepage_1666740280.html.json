Mr. Trump has been holding out hope that the Supreme Court will hear the case and ultimately award him a second term. Legal experts are skeptical, however, and have largely dismissed it as a publicity stunt.\nLate Tuesday, the president asked Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican, if he would be willing to argue the case, according to a person familiar with their conversation. Mr. Cruz agreed, this person said. And the president has filed a motion with the court to intervene, which would make him a party to the case.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/us/politics/trump-texas-supreme-court-lawsuit.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage"}
