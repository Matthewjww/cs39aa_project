But in recent years, European manufacturers of previously used drugs like pentobarbital and sodium thiopental, in response to pressure from groups opposed to the death penalty, have blocked their sale for use in executions.\nImage Dennis McGuire Credit... Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, via Associated Press\nOhio, which had run out of its supply of pentobarbital, used a combination of midazolam, an anti-anxiety drug in the same family as Valium, and hydromorphone, a powerful narcotic derived from morphine. A court gave its approval to the combination, overruling lawyers for Mr. McGuire who had argued that the drugs could cause “air hunger,” a struggle for breath that, the lawyers said, could result in “agony and terror.”\nBut in persuading the court to allow the use of the drugs, Thomas Madden, an Ohio assistant attorney general, argued that although there are constitutional protections, “you’re not entitled to a pain-free execution.”\nDeath penalty opponents said that the shortage of drugs has led to a chaotic national picture, with individual states trying out different drug formulas, sometimes with disturbing results. Mr. McGuire’s execution was not the first in Ohio to inspire controversy: In 2009, the execution of Romell Broom was halted after executioners struggled for two hours to get an intravenous line to deliver the drugs. His lawyers argued that a second execution attempt would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Mr. Broom is still on death row.\nDeborah Denno, a law professor at Fordham University and an expert on lethal injections, said that a Supreme Court ruling that upheld Kentucky’s use of a three-drug cocktail for lethal injections in 2008 was based in part on the uniformity of drug combinations across the states.\nBut she said, as the drugs have become less available, “That’s no longer the case.” She added, “This is a very different world in 2014 than it was in 2008.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/us/prolonged-execution-prompts-debate-over-death-penalty-methods.html"}
