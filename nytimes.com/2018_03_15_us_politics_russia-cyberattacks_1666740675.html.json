The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated.\nIn the following months, according to a Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/russia-cyberattacks.html"}
