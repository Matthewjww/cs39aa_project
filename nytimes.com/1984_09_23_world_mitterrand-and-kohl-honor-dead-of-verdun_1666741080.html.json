It holds the remains of 8,700 soldiers.\nPresident Mitterrand invited Chancellor Kohl to Verdun last May. The invitation was widely viewed in France as having been improvised to soothe feelings after the West German leader had been left out of the 40th anniversary celebrations of the Allied landings in Normandy in World War II.\nThere was no time scheduled for political consultations between the two leaders. But they were expected to meet again in Bonn next month.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/23/world/mitterrand-and-kohl-honor-dead-of-verdun.html"}
