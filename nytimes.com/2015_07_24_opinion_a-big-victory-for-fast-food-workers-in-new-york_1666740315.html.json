Andrew Cuomo proposed raising the minimum wage for fast-food workers in New York to $15 an hour. The increase would be fully phased in by the end of 2018 for workers in New York City and by mid-2021 for those in the rest of the state. Currently, fast-food pay in New York is about $9 an hour.\nUnder New York law, the governor can appoint a wage board, composed of business, labor and public representatives, to recommend raises in occupations where pay is judged to be too low to support a basic living; the state labor commissioner can then order the increase without legislative approval. In the past, the process has been used to raise pay for tipped workers and young workers.\nThe acting state labor commissioner, Mario Musolino, is expected to promptly approve the board’s recommendation, which applies to about 140,000 workers in New York who are employed by restaurants with 30 or more locations nationwide. The first of the incremental increases — to $10.50 within the city and to $9.75 elsewhere — is expected in December.\nThe raise itself, however, is likely to be only one of several outcomes of the board’s action. A fast-food wage of $15 could push up wages in New York more broadly because it sets a new bar for retailers, home care agencies and other low-wage employers to meet or exceed.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/opinion/a-big-victory-for-fast-food-workers-in-new-york.html"}
