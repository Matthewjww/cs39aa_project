An Israeli F-16, returning from the attack, crashed in northern Israel after coming under heavy Syrian antiaircraft fire — the first Israeli jet downed under enemy fire in decades.\nIsrael responded with strikes against eight Syrian and four Iranian targets in Syrian territory.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the day’s events as proof of Israel’s resolve. “Yesterday we dealt severe blows to the Iranian and Syrian forces,” he said Sunday. “We made it unequivocally clear to everyone that our rules of action have not changed one bit. We will continue to strike at every attempt to strike at us.”\nBut strategists and military analysts in Israel did not see things quite so simply. As both sides sift through the debris, here are some important points:\nThis isn’t over. It’s just beginning.\nAs the Syrian civil war winds down, a new conflict is emerging among Iran, which appears to want a lasting Syrian base to threaten Israel; Israel, which is determined to prevent this; and the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, which showed renewed confidence in firing on Israel’s warplanes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/world/middleeast/israel-iran-syria-clash.html"}
