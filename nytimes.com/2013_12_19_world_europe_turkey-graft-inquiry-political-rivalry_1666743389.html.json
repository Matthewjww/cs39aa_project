On Wednesday came the scintillating details in leaks to the local media: $4.5 million in cash packed in shoe boxes found in the home of the chief executive of a state-run bank; a money-counting machine and piles of bank notes discovered in the bedroom of a government minister’s son.\n“Maybe he likes money, maybe he likes counting it, who knows?” said Bulent Arinc, a deputy prime minister with the governing Justice and Development Party, at an evening news conference.\nMore seriously, Mr. Arinc, whose party has been shaken by a widening corruption investigation, said the case amounted to a plot within the state — widely perceived to be led by followers of Fethullah Gulen, an influential Muslim cleric who lives in Pennsylvania — and suggested that the government would purge those responsible for the investigation. He denied that he was specifically referring to Gulen followers, but over the years, many are said to have taken up influential positions within the judiciary and police force. “Our opinion is that this is a planned operation, and the purpose of the investigation is to launch psychological warfare, to tarnish our government,” Mr. Arinc said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/world/europe/turkey-graft-inquiry-political-rivalry.html"}
