Getting to the party required a harrowing landing on a steeply inclined covert airstrip. Once he was safely on the ground — and after he had said a few prayers — Mr. Cifuentes resolved, he told jurors, to buy Mr. Guzmán a helicopter so he could “fly in a more civilized way.”\nThat same year, he started sending Mr. Guzmán shipments of cocaine in carbon-fiber airplanes that were specially designed to frustrate radar. In 2007, after his brother — a former pilot for the Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar — was killed, Mr. Cifuentes fled to Ecuador, where he began arranging drug deals with the FARC for Mr. Guzmán and protecting their investment by bribing a local military officer.\nThe officer was not the only person Mr. Cifuentes has acknowledged paying off. He testified that he routinely bribed the Ecuadorean Navy (for information about American naval ships) and the Colombian police (“whenever it was needed”). Early in his career, he told the jurors, he once paid off Colombian officials to expunge his prison record.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html"}
