He calls himself an independent, which is common here in New Hampshire. And he’s uneasy about the political establishment and Democratic Party standard-bearers.\nPerhaps it is no surprise, then, that Mr. Smith voted for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the 2016 Democratic primary. Mr. Sanders was exactly the sort of outsider Mr. Smith said he was looking to support four years ago.\nBut he won’t be voting for Mr. Sanders this time around. Instead, Mr. Smith said, he is leaning toward two other candidates who have, in their own ways, taken on outsider and anti-establishment labels: the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.\n“I don’t want Trump to win in 2020, and I want someone who I think can beat him,” Mr. Smith said, minutes before Mr. Yang arrived at an event to open a campaign office in Plymouth last week. “Though I love a lot of what Bernie says, I think he’s not going to pull some of those voters over who are in the middle — especially those a little bit on the right. I think Andrew Yang and Tulsi can; they’re a little more moderate.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-andrew-yang-tulsi-gabbard.html"}
