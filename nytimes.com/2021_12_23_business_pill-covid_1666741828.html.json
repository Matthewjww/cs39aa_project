But in the coming weeks, it is expected to be more available in the United States than other treatment options.\nOlder people and those who have conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease would be eligible to get a prescription for Merck’s pills if they get sick from the coronavirus and cannot get treatments such as Pfizer’s newly authorized pills or monoclonal antibody treatments.
