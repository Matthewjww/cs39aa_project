Trump, spoke at the DealBook DC Policy Project about the state of the markets, the future for financial regulation and the lessons from meme-stock mania.\nHighlights from the discussion:\n“People didn’t pay much attention to order flow until recently, because you had trade commissions, and if you look at it holistically, trade commissions were a more significant source of revenue for brokerages,” Mr. Tenev said. “Payment for order flow is necessary to generate some revenue to cover our costs of running this business. You can think of it as a profit share between market-making, which is also a for-profit business, and the introducing broker in this case, Robinhood.” (For more about the practice of payment for order flow, read this.)\n“What we want is to drive competition between brokers, drive competition between market-makers, and do it in a way that the costs of trading are driven down, yet still resilient, still liquid. And that has happened,” Mr. Clayton said. “That has happened dramatically over the last two decades and now we are at a new point. We have a new flow into the system: much more retail flow.”\n“I think it’s pathological that you could have greater than 100 percent short interest,” Mr. Tenev said. “It’s because we are unable to track it. If I own a stock and then I lend it to someone who shorts it and someone else buys it, that buyer doesn’t know that it’s been lent before. So the system is not tracking how many times a stock has been shorted.” On moving U.S. markets to real-time settlement, “not only can you speed up settlement time, but you can actually improve how you track these shares,” he added. “And we should know exactly what the chain of custody for all of these shares has been and how many times it’s been shorted.” Mr. Clayton noted, “We trade in milliseconds, but we settle and lend in days,” and to avoid the risks this creates, “They need to be brought into harmony.”\n“I don’t think short selling is inherently wrong,” Mr. Tenev said. “But if you short sell the same share hundreds of times, I don’t know if people have really studied the effects of that and how things would be different if there was some limitation.”\nOn investing and social media: “There is a difference between the classic ‘pump and dump,’ which is: You take a company that probably doesn’t do very much, you go out to unsuspecting folks and you say, ‘Buy this stock, it’s going to take off.’ You create demand in the marketplace yourself by buying a few shares. And as the tide rises, you sell out and that’s terrible behavior. It’s bad for our markets,” Mr. Clayton said. “That’s different from let’s go to the complete other end of the spectrum. People on social media saying, ‘You know what? I’ve done my research. I like this company. You know, let’s sort of buy in it together.’ One of the difficult things for regulators is life is almost always somewhere in between.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/23/business/dealbook-dc-policy-project/karen-lynch-of-cvs-health-on-the-vaccine-rollout"}
