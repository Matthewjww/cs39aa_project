Mattis as defense secretary and John F. Kelly as homeland security secretary.\nRepublicans had hoped to approve far more than two nominees on Mr. Trump’s first day in office, but that process has been delayed in part because several of the nominees have been slow in filing ethics disclosures, prompting protests by Senate Democrats.\nWhile Republicans sought to confirm a third national security nominee on Friday, Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, the president’s choice to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, Democrats managed to delay his approval until Monday, when he is expected to receive a vote after some debate.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/us/politics/trump-cabinet-confirmation-mattis-kelly.html"}
