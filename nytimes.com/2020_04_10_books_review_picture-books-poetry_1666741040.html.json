They lose one egg before it hatches, but two survive and the fuzzy owlet chicks grow gradually stronger as their parents fend off various predators. Gianferrari tells this avian story wholly in haiku, introducing children to an easy-to-grasp poetic form, against the appropriately moody naturalistic wash of Voss’s stunning pictures, in sepia ink and watercolor.\n32 pp. Putnam. $16.99.
