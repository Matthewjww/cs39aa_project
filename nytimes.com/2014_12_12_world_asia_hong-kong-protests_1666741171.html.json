There was no violence, only a few defiant final stands and many tearful goodbyes, as the nearly three-month Umbrella Movement disbanded.\n“It was like my home,” Ms. So said. “I’m leaving my friends behind. I feel like I’m betraying them.”\nFor the Hong Kong authorities and their superiors in Beijing, the peaceful end to the protest is likely to be seen as a major victory. They repeatedly rebuffed demands for a greater degree of democracy in this former British colony, and defused the longest sustained political uprising on Chinese territory in many years without a bloody crackdown.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/world/asia/hong-kong-protests.html"}
