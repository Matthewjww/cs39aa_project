But California produces almost no pork, even as its residents consume 13 percent of the pork produced in other states.\nThe question for the justices was whether the law’s impact on business practices in those other states ran afoul of the Constitution.\nJustice Elena Kagan said she was worried that states might enact all sorts of laws effectively regulating conduct outside their borders.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/us/supreme-court-pigs-animal-cruelty.html"}
