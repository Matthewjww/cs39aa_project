Hochul, the Erie County clerk, at a candidates forum. She opposes licenses for illegal immigrants. Credit... Doug Benz for The New York Times\nBut perhaps no local official has been put on the spot quite like Ms. Hochul (pronounced HOKE-ul).\nThough Erie County residents seem to support one part of Mr. Spitzer’s new plan — the introduction of two kinds of federally recognized licenses, one of which could be used by United States citizens to cross the Canadian border without passports — Ms. Hochul said that they continued to oppose allowing illegal immigrants to obtain the new plan’s third tier of license, akin to the current standard driver’s license.\n“This has really become the centerpiece of this race,” Ms. Hochul said. Buffalo is a border city, she notes, and memories of the six Qaeda recruits, American citizens of Yemeni descent, who once lived in nearby Lackawanna are still fresh.\nIn fact, Ms. Hochul’s husband, an assistant United States attorney for the Western District of New York, was the lead prosecutor on the case. The six men, who had traveled to a Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in 2001, pleaded guilty three years ago to charges of providing support to a terrorist organization.\nMoreover, Ms. Hochul is herself a Spitzer appointee; she got the job in April after Mr. Spitzer appointed David J. Swarts, the previous Erie clerk, to be the new state commissioner of motor vehicles. Ms. Hochul even held a meet-and-greet for Mr. Spitzer at her home during last year’s campaign.\n“I support him on the environment. I support him on worker’s comp reform. I support him on job creation. I support what he’s doing on the waterfront here,” Ms. Hochul said. “But this is an issue I disagree with him very strongly on. And he knows that.”\nMs. Hochul abstained from voting on the clerks’ resolution last month. But she has since registered her disagreement with Mr. Spitzer in myriad ways. She has asked the State Legislature to hold hearings in Buffalo on the issue, sent letters of protest to the governor and to Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo. She also requested a formal opinion from the Erie district attorney on whether the new policy is legal and enforceable.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/nyregion/04license.html"}
