A homegrown extremist group loyal to ISIS seized the city about a year ago. The result was the longest urban combat in the country since World War II. At least 350,000 people were displaced, including the Magindiri family. When they heard the first shots, this family of six packed up the car with the few belongings they could grab and escaped to a neighboring city. Today is their first day back home. Across Marawi most houses look like this, or much worse. It all started when a group of about 900 pro-ISIS fighters stormed this majority-Muslim city last May. For five months, the Philippine army, with help from the United States, pushed back. They attacked with airstrikes and close-fought urban combat. In October, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared Marawi liberated. And just last month, the city was reopened for residents to come in — but only to see their homes, recover what they can and then leave again. No one was allowed to stay because large parts of the city were still unsafe. Bomb-removal squads made up mostly of volunteers were using flashlights on their phones. Only a few areas had been checked for unexploded ordnance. And here people came home to unidentified skeletal remains. According to the Philippine government, at least 900 militants and around 168 soldiers were killed here. Most of the city’s residents had fled and survived. Across the city, we met families who were stunned by the destruction. Haydee Dimalawang had not seen her home in 10 months. “This is our vault.” “What was inside the vault?” “That’s money, now nothing. It’s water.” Reconstruction will take years. But Chinese contractors are already rushing in with bids to rebuild. And President Duterte has shown interest in what China has to offer. This cozying up, experts say, points to China’s growing influence in a country that has been a traditional U.S. ally in the region. While governments around the world hail the defeat of ISIS, for the people here who have lost their homes the fight is not finished. When they’ll be able to return, no one really knows.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000005858523/isis-loyalists-marawi.html?playlistId=video/isis-conflict"}
