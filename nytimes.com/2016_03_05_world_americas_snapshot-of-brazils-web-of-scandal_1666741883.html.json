The raid on Mr. da Silva’s house was the latest development in the expanding political and economic turmoil in Brazil.\nWhy is Brazil in such upheaval?\nA struggling economy and discontent over the corruption scheme involving the national oil company, Petrobras, have affected nearly every level of government in Brazil, Latin America’s largest country.
