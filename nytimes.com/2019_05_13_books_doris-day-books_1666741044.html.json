(1976)\nThis book is Day’s autobiography, based on a series of interviews she granted to Hotchner. In the introduction, Day promises “no holds barred, no pandering to the public image.” True to her word, the book exposes the gap between her sunny reputation and the personal challenges she faced, including a violent first marriage and a third husband who embezzled her money, a fact she discovered only after his death. Despite these setbacks, “she has apparently never suffered from self‐pity — one of the most refreshing aspects of this untypical Hollywood biography,” our reviewer wrote.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/books/doris-day-books.html"}
