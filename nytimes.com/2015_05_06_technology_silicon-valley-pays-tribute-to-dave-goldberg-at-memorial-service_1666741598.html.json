About 1,700 people, most of whom, in the world’s eyes, seem blessed beyond imagining, paused to contemplate fate and mortality. Many wept.\nMr. Goldberg died on Friday from head injuries after collapsing on a treadmill at a luxury villa in Mexico, according to the authorities. He was 47 and the chief executive of SurveyMonkey, an online polling service.\nHis widow is Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. Mr. Goldberg was a star at Yahoo, and Ms. Sandberg was at Google before she joined Facebook. Between them, they seemed to know almost everyone among the leaders in entertainment, tech and politics.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/technology/silicon-valley-pays-tribute-to-dave-goldberg-at-memorial-service.html"}
