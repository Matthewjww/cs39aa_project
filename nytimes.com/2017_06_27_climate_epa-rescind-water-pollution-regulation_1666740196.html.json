Issued under the authority of the 1972 Clean Water Act, the rule has been hailed by environmentalists. But farmers, ranchers and real estate developers oppose it as an infringement on their property rights.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/climate/epa-rescind-water-pollution-regulation.html"}
