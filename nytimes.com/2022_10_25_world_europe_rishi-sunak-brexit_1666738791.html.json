The country’s youngest prime minister in modern times at 42, Mr. Sunak became a member of Parliament just seven years ago and was appointed in 2020 as chancellor of the Exchequer by Mr. Johnson.\nHis early support of Brexit “put him on that right side of history within the Conservative Party,” said Tony Travers, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/world/europe/rishi-sunak-brexit.html"}
