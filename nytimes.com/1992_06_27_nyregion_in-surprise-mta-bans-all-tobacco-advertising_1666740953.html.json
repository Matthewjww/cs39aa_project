The agency's annual budget is $3 billion.\n\"I have concerns about free speech,\" said Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the M.T.A. \"But we also have an obligation to reduce the exposure of people, especially children, to a product that causes death.\"\nThe ban came as a surprise because the M.T.A. board had been expected to cut the amount of tobacco advertising it allowed in half. But board members said that, for a relatively slight difference in lost revenue, the ads could be banned, which they thought was better public health policy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/27/nyregion/in-surprise-mta-bans-all-tobacco-advertising.html"}
