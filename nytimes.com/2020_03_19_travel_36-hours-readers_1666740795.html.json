Read 36 Hours … in Wherever You Are here.\nIt’s a strange time for everyone. For us at New York Times Travel, we’re asking many existential questions, among them: How do we talk about travel when it’s grinding to a halt?\nSo we’re asking you to join us in a special experiment. For nearly two decades, we’ve published our weekly 36 Hours column, guiding our readers with packed itineraries for weekends in cities all over the globe.\nWhile traveling for fun is not an option now, we’re inspired by the enduring spirit of discovery, curiosity and creativity.\nAnd that’s where you come in. We’d like to create a special “36 Hours in Wherever You Are” — the first reader-generated column in its long history.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/travel/36-hours-readers.html"}
