According to Joel Cowley, the president and chief executive of the event, visiting the grounds is a fun experience for all, with plenty to offer to people who aren’t traditionally interested in agriculture or rodeo events.\n“Anyone from little kids to great-grandparents can have a good time because there is such a diverse lineup of activities,” he said.\nAdmission to the 300-acre event grounds is $15 per day for adults and $5 for children between the ages of 3 and 12. Admission to the daily rodeo and concert in NRG Stadium, one of the park’s main venues, starts at $18 and includes entry into all other activities on the grounds. Admission is free for children 2 and under.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/travel/a-livestock-show-and-rodeo-worth-seeing-but-so-much-more.html"}
