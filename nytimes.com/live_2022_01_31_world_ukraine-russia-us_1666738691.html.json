Security Council Meeting Russia called the public meeting on the Ukraine crisis an example of “megaphone diplomacy,” while the U.S. criticized Russia, saying, “Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops sitting at your border.” Voice of translator: “We are being asked to convene this Security Council meeting on unfounded accusations that we have refuted frequently. Furthermore, the open format of discussion proposed by the U.S. on this extremely sensitive topic is making this a classic example of megaphone diplomacy, and working in public, for the public rather. There’s a need to — we’ve all stated this frequently. We do not think that this will help to bring this council together. Rather, we fully understand that the desire of our American colleagues to whip up hysterics.” “You’ve heard from our Russian colleagues that we’re calling for this meeting to make you all feel uncomfortable. Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops sitting on your border in the way that these troops are sitting on the border with Ukraine. Colleagues, the situation we’re facing in Europe is urgent and dangerous, and the stakes for Ukraine and for every U.N. member state could not be higher. Russia’s actions strike at the very heart of the U.N. Charter. This is as clear and consequential a threat to peace and security as anyone can imagine.” Russia called the public meeting on the Ukraine crisis an example of “megaphone diplomacy,” while the U.S. criticized Russia, saying, “Imagine how uncomfortable you would be if you had 100,000 troops sitting at your border.” Credit Credit... Andrew Kelly/Reuters\nThe United States and Russia engaged in a bitter diplomatic brawl Monday at the U.N. Security Council over the Ukraine crisis, with the Americans accusing the Russians of endangering peace by massing troops on Ukraine’s borders and Kremlin diplomats dismissing what they called hysterical U.S. fearmongering.\n“The situation we are facing in Europe is urgent and dangerous,” the United States ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said in her opening remarks. “Russia’s actions strike at the very heart of the U.N. charter.”\nHer Russian counterpart, Vasily Nebenzia, portrayed the Americans as provocateurs, “whipping up tensions and provoking escalation,” as he insisted that Russia had no plan to invade Ukraine.\n“You are almost pulling for this,” he said, looking at Mrs. Thomas-Greenfield. “You want it to happen. You’re waiting for it to happen, as if you want to make your words become a reality.”\nThe meeting — requested by the United States last week — was the highest-profile arena for the two powers to sway world opinion over Ukraine. And it had all the Cold War atmospherics of the angry debates that once punctuated council sessions during the tense days of faceoffs between the United States and Soviet Union decades ago.\nThe current crisis surrounding Ukraine has been smoldering since Russia annexed the former Soviet Republic’s Crimean Peninsula nearly eight years ago after a Russia-friendly government in Ukraine was ousted.\nEvents in recent weeks have brought U.S.-Russian relations to their lowest point since the Cold War. Russia has sent more than 100,000 troops to the Ukrainian border, and President Vladimir V. Putin has demanded that NATO never admit Ukraine as a member — all part of his effort to protect and enlarge his country’s sphere of influence in Eastern Europe.\nThe Biden administration has vowed to respond to a Russian invasion of Ukraine with crippling economic sanctions.\nThe Security Council meeting adjourned after two hours with no action taken — although none had been expected. Mr. Nebenzia left the meeting before it was over. Mrs. Thomas-Greenfield said afterward that the Russians “didn’t give us the answers we hoped they’d provide.”\nBut the Biden administration regarded the meeting as an important venue to display the resolve of the United States and its allies to confront Russia over Ukraine.\n“If Russia is sincere about addressing our respective security concerns through dialogue, the United States and our Allies and partners will continue to engage in good faith,” Mr. Biden said in a White House statement about the meeting. “If instead Russia chooses to walk away from diplomacy and attack Ukraine, Russia will bear the responsibility, and it will face swift and severe consequences.”\nMr. Putin, who has not spoken publicly about Ukraine since December, maintained his silence.\nAt one point during the meeting, Mrs. Thomas-Greenfield said the Russian military buildup on Ukraine’s borders reflected “an escalation in a pattern of aggression that we’ve seen from Russia again and again.” If the Russians invaded Ukraine, she said, “none of us will be able to say we didn’t see it coming.”\nMr. Nebenzia said Russia wanted peace and accused the United States and its Western allies of manufacturing a fake crisis to weaken Russia and drive a wedge between it and Ukraine.\n10,000 5,000 Troops Artillery Armored vehicles Tanks Other military or air installations 1,000 Moscow Russia has begun moving troops, armor and advanced antiaircraft systems into Belarus, a close ally.
