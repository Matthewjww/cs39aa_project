He renounced his monastic vows in the middle of his stewardship of Tibet. He was later kidnapped by Mongolian warriors allied to the Manchu Chinese court and died in captivity about three centuries ago at the age of 33  or so one story goes. Another tells of his winning his freedom and wandering the Tibetan lands as an ascetic.\nSo goes the legend of Tsangyang Gyamtso, one of the most popular historical figures among Tibetans and the most colorful of the long line of Dalai Lamas. His poetry is among the most iconic in Tibetan literature.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/26/world/asia/26dalailama.html"}
