The president has been aided in the courts, which threw out the country’s term limits, describing them as unfair to politicians like Mr. Morales, a leftist who has reshaped Bolivia in his dozen years in power.\nMr. Paucara now fears that if the president wins again next year, he may be well on track to keep the job for life, unwilling to hand over his office to any successor.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/world/americas/bolivia-evo-morales-elections.html"}
