During the five years that Marissa Mayer, the chief executive, has led the company, its work force dropped by 46 percent. AOL has also gone through repeated layoffs, most recently in November, when it cut 500 jobs.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/technology/verizon-yahoo-deal-layoffs.html"}
