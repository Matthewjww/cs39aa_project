The company is expected to send about two million doses to the United States by the end of the year, but can produce less than five million more for the rest of the world.\nThe manufacturing facility that could make more has been shut for a planned expansion since last August. The facility is not expected to reopen until late this summer at the earliest, and additional vaccine manufactured there may not become available for at least six months after that.\nBecause testing has been patchy, the scope of the monkeypox outbreak, and therefore the need for vaccines, is uncertain, said Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/health/monkeypox-vaccine-bavarian-nordic.html"}
