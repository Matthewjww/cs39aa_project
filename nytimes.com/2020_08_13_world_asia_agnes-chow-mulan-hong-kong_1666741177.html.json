Disney’s slogan: “The legend arrives.”\nSupporters on Twitter quickly anointed Ms. Chow, 23, “the real Mulan.” One meme featured three images, each accompanied by text: the “Mulan” star Liu Yifei (“I want the real Mulan”); the cartoon version of Mulan from Disney’s animated 1998 film (“I said the real Mulan”); and Ms. Chow (“Perfection”).", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/world/asia/agnes-chow-mulan-hong-kong.html"}
