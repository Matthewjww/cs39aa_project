The Society of Breast Imaging recommends trying to schedule your routine screening mammogram before your first Covid-19 vaccine dose or at least one month after your second vaccine dose. But an alternative plan would be to get the vaccine in your thigh instead.\n“Injection in thigh would be extremely unlikely to lead to armpit nodes swelling,” Dr. Constance D. Lehman, the chief of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, told The New York Times earlier this month.\nIf you prefer to get the vaccine in your arm and have already scheduled your mammogram, you can keep that appointment — as well as your vaccine appointment — and call your breast imaging center ahead of time to let them know about the timing of your vaccine.\nIf you received the Covid vaccine in the arm in the last six weeks, your radiologist will expect to see lymph node swelling on the same side that you received the vaccine. This would be a normal finding unless the swelling continued for more than six weeks or there were other clinical concerns; in that case they would take more images as needed, Ms. Brunelle said.\nWhich vaccination sites offer thigh injections?\nThis could take a little persistence. Covid-19 vaccine sites primarily give people arm vaccinations: It’s quick, efficient and there’s no need to find a private room to disrobe. Because the vast majority of people will receive arm injections, some vaccination sites may not have staff who are trained to inject in the thigh.\n“I just advise patients to call ahead, let the vaccine clinic know or the pharmacy know that they’re asking for the vaccine in the thigh,” Ms. Brunelle said. “I also counsel patients that if a local facility or practitioner giving the vaccine is not familiar with the thigh as an approved alternate site, the patient can share the C.D.C. Standing Orders document that lists the thigh as an alternative site for both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/well/live/covid-vaccine-thigh-lymphedema-breast-cancer.html"}
