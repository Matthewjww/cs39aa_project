The 150-year-old music hall was sold out for the show by the American group Eagles of Death Metal.\nSuddenly, four men brandishing AK-47 assault rifles entered the hall. There were shouts of “Allahu akbar” just before the gunmen opened fire, and for about 20 minutes there was carnage.\nWitnesses said the attackers also threw grenades into the crowd.\n“When they started shooting, we just saw flashes,” a witness named Gwen told French BFM-TV. “People got down on the ground right away. It was all dark.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/world/europe/paris-attacks.html"}
