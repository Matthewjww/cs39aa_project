Alfa Romeo had scored just three points in 13 races last year when Bottas confirmed he would be racing for the team this season.\nBottas, who won 10 Grands Prix with Mercedes, saw potential with Alfa Romeo and altered his mind-set. “I had enough time to prepare myself for this chapter in my career,” he said in an interview. “I basically just reset all the expectations and goals. My targets are different now, and what gives me satisfaction is maybe a different result compared to a few years ago.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/08/sports/autoracing/f1-valtteri-bottas-alfa-romeo.html"}
