Urbanski, 22, with assault and first- and second-degree murder in the death of Richard W. Collins III, 23, who had just been commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army and was preparing to move to Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., for training in defending the country against chemical attacks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/black-student-stabbed-maryland.html"}
