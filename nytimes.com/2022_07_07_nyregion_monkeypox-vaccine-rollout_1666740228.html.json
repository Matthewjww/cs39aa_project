They were gone in 10 minutes.\nDr. Vasan apologized for the mistakes at the news conference, at which he announced the opening of a second clinic in Harlem and explained that the city would work harder to insure a more equitable approach as more appointments become available.\n“Our vendor experienced technical glitches, and New Yorkers have had to wait much longer than they should have to get this vaccine,” Dr. Vasan said. “Ultimately, they work for us and the buck stops with us.”\nHe added: “Equity is an incredibly hard thing to preserve in an environment of scarce supply.”\nCases of monkeypox have been steadily increasing in the city, even though testing has been limited. New York City’s public health lab, which had been the sole city location running the test for the disease, has been able to test only 10 people per day, city officials said. But testing will now be able to ramp up: As of Wednesday, health providers can now order monkeypox tests through Labcorp, a commercial testing company.\nDr. Vasan said that he picked Chelsea, an upscale Manhattan area, as the location for the first clinic because 75 percent of the city’s known cases so far have been in Manhattan, and one-third of all cases have been in the Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen neighborhoods, areas with large gay populations.\nWith the arrival of 6,000 additional doses this week, the city added the second vaccine clinic, which opened Thursday. It is planning a third clinic in Corona, Queens, once vaccine supply increases.\nAt the news conference on Thursday, officials acknowledged that there were high levels of anxiety among men who have sex with men and that there were still many unknowns about the disease’s spread. But they underscored that the risk to most New Yorkers remains low.\nShortly after the officials left, a line of men with appointments began to form. By noon, it stretched north on Fifth Avenue and west down 137th Street.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/07/nyregion/monkeypox-vaccine-rollout.html"}
