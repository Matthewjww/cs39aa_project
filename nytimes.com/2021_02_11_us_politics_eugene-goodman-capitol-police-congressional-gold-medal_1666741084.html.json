Trump, one video stood out: a Capitol Police officer sprinting toward a senator to warn of the angry mob nearby.\nThe senator, Mitt Romney of Utah, is shown turning on his heels and fleeing to safety.\n“I don’t think my family or my wife understood that I was as close as I might have been to real danger,” Mr. Romney told reporters on Thursday, one day after the video showed Officer Eugene Goodman aiding him. “They were surprised and very, very appreciative of Officer Goodman, in his being there and directing me back to safety.”\nFor Officer Goodman, it was the second time a video went viral displaying actions widely credited with saving members of Congress. The first, which showed him single-handedly luring the mob away from the entrance to the Senate toward an area with reinforcements, turned him into a hero. The second has added to his lore.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/politics/eugene-goodman-capitol-police-congressional-gold-medal.html"}
