Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy are all battling major outbreaks, in many cases imposing quarantines to contain the spread. That has disrupted supply chains, forcing companies like Apple and Toyota to idle factories in China and grounding airlines as consumers stayed home, sending stock prices plunging.\nIn the best case scenario, the virus is quickly contained and the global economy suffers a hiccup. The American economy is in its 11th year of an expansion, and many economists believe that the underlying fundamentals remain strong and that growth will continue, helping to insulate the United States from a big shock.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/business/economy/coronavirus-central-banks-economy.html"}
