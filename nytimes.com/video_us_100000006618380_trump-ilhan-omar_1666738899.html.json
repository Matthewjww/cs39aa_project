But I will say this. I did. And I started speaking very quickly. But it started out rather fast as you probably noticed.

Crowd: “Send her back!” And she talked about the evil Israel and “it’s all about the Benjamins.” Not a good thing to say.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000006618380/trump-ilhan-omar.html"}
