Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, again raised the possibility of a vaccination requirement for air travel.\nAt least 2,600 more flights were canceled Monday, including about 1,000 U.S. flights, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus is sending daily caseloads in parts of the United States soaring to levels higher than last winter’s pandemic peak.\nWhile the cancellations were only a small percentage of overall flights, the problem threatened to extend into the holiday week.\n“When you make vaccination a requirement, that’s another incentive to get more people vaccinated,” Dr. Fauci said on MSNBC on Monday. “If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that’s something that seriously should be considered.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/business/weekend-flights-canceled-omicron.html"}
