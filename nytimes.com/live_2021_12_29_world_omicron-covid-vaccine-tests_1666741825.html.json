Long lines are forming at testing sites across the country, and record numbers of cases have been recorded this week. Credit... Cheney Orr/Reuters\nWith a caseload nearly twice that of the worst days last winter, the United States shattered its record for new daily coronavirus cases, a milestone that may not adequately illustrate the rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants because testing has slowed over the holidays.\nAs a second year of living with the pandemic was drawing to a close, the new daily case total topped 488,000 on Wednesday, according to a New York Times database. (The total was higher on Monday, but that number should not be considered a record because it included data from the long holiday weekend.)\nWednesday’s seven-day average of new daily cases, 301,000, was also a record, compared with 267,000 the day before, according to the database. In the past week, more than two million cases have been reported nationally, and 15 states and territories reported more cases than in any other seven-day period.\nThe rise in cases has been driven by the highly contagious Omicron variant, which became dominant in the United States as of last week. So far, however, those increased cases have not resulted in more severe disease, as hospitalizations have increased only 11 percent and deaths have decreased slightly in the past two weeks.\nBecause Covid tests have been in short supply over the holidays, Wednesday’s numbers still may not fully illustrate the havoc caused by the two variants, which have sent caseloads soaring and have worsened a labor shortage, upending the hospitality, medical and travel industries, among others.\nDemand for tests has outstripped supply, particularly in the last month as the Omicron variant has spread at an astonishing speed. And the holiday season offers its own disruptions to the U.S. case curve, with many testing sites offering limited hours and labs and government offices not open to report test results.\nLast year, the national case curve showed pronounced declines after Thanksgiving and Christmas that did not reflect real decreases in new infections. The impact of holidays may be even more noticeable this time around, as illustrated by the Labor Day holiday in September, because states are reporting data less consistently than they did a year ago.\nBefore Tuesday, the seven-day U.S. average had peaked on Jan. 11 at 251,232. That was during a catastrophic winter when vaccinations were still relatively new. Today, more than 62 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated.\nNo matter what the true caseload is right now, the United States has confronted a new set of challenges as the Delta and Omicron variants have converged. The variants have disrupted holiday travel and gatherings, depleted hospital staffs and plunged the United States into another long winter.\nUnited States Covid-19 Hospitalizations Covid patients in hospitals and I.C.U.s Early data may be incomplete. All time Last 90 days Feb. 2020 Aug. Feb. 2021 Aug. Feb. 2022 Aug. 50,000 100,000 150,000 hospitalized Hospitalized In I.C.U.s 26,630 Source: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The seven-day average is the average of a day and the previous six days of data. Currently hospitalized is the most recent number of patients with Covid-19 reported by hospitals in the state for the four days prior. Dips and spikes could be due to inconsistent reporting by hospitals. Hospitalization numbers early in the pandemic are undercounts due to incomplete reporting by hospitals to the federal government.\nRecord caseloads have been reported in a laundry list of U.S. cities where vaccination rates are relatively high, including New York, Washington, Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta and Detroit.\nExperts say there are two reasons for the high numbers in urban areas: population density and more Covid testing.\nCities are tightly packed hubs for travel and socializing, which leaves people more susceptible to the highly contagious Omicron variant, said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n“Then you layer in on top of it that we do a lot of testing in these major urban centers precisely because we’re worried about big surges overwhelming hospitals,” she said on Wednesday.\nIn fact, she said, city caseloads may be higher than reported because of the rise in at-home tests that often don’t get reported to state officials, so they don’t end up in official case totals.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/12/29/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests"}
