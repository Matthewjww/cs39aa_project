Districts should be as compact as possible, and they must be contiguous. But communities with common interests should be kept whole to maintain their voice, especially racial minorities.\nIn a state like New York, where politicians from a single party control the process, they will also try to eke out as much partisan political gain as they can.\nHow Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause. Learn more about our process.\nSo it is in Mr. Nadler’s new district.\nIts broad outlines — stretching from the Upper West Side to Borough Park — have been in place for decades. In 2012, a nonpartisan court-appointed special master gave her stamp of approval.\nWhile it will soon include a huge range of economic and racial groups, including Chinese populations in Manhattan’s Chinatown and Brooklyn’s Sunset Park, mapmakers have long used the district to unite some of the city’s most robust Jewish communities rooted on the Upper West Side and in Brooklyn’s Borough Park neighborhood. No district in the country has more Jewish voters, and Mr. Nadler, who was educated in a yeshiva, is the last remaining Jewish House member from New York City.\nAnd Jewish leaders have repeatedly given public testimony over the years calling for the two areas to remain stitched together.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/nyregion/nyc-congressional-district-nadler.html"}
