After that, they reportedly said, the military would decide if the patients would be admitted.\n“This is simply not acceptable,” said Anders Fange, the country director for the Swedish Committee for Afghanistan, which runs schools, medical clinics and development projects in eastern Afghanistan.\nIn a statement, Mr. Fange called the episode “not only a clear violation of globally recognized humanitarian principles about the sanctity of health facilities and staff in areas of conflict, but also a clear breach of the civil-military agreement” between nongovernmental organizations and international forces.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/asia/08kabul.html"}
