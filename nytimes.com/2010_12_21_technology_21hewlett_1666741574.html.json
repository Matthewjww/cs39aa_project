Hurd’s sudden departure from Hewlett-Packard, the latest twist in a five-month story that has put the company in the middle of Silicon Valley’s version of a soap opera.\nOfficials with the Securities and Exchange Commission have started a preliminary investigation that centers on Mr. Hurd’s surprise resignation from H.P. in August, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The exact nature of the investigation remains unclear, this person said.\nAn H.P. spokeswoman, Mylene Mangalindan, said, “H.P. is cooperating fully with the S.E.C. on its investigation.”\nJohn Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment. The agency typically does not comment on such matters.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/technology/21hewlett.html"}
