Andrew M. Cuomo said on Tuesday he wants to jump-start a long-stalled plan to expand a key stretch of the Long Island Rail Road.\nThe plan, which would add a track to part of the Main Line, would increase the number of trains serving the system, and would, the governor said, deliver a boost to Long Island’s economy.\nSpeaking to a business group at a breakfast in Nassau County, Mr. Cuomo said more reliable rail service would lure more drivers out of their cars and onto mass transit and that would in turn ease congestion on Long Island’s roads.\n“We can make mass transit more attractive, faster, more comfortable,” Mr. Cuomo said in his speech to the Long Island Association. “People will be more willing to come out of their cars and get into the trains, which is exactly what we have to do.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/nyregion/cuomo-revives-long-stalled-plan-to-add-track-to-lirr.html"}
