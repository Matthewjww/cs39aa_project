Bollea, sued Gawker for invasion of privacy after the website posted in 2012 a black-and-white tape made in 2007 that showed Mr. Bollea having sex with the wife of a friend of his at the time, Todd Clem, a radio shock jock who had legally changed his name to Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. Mr. Bollea said the videotape was made and distributed without his permission.\nThe juryâ€™s award of damages was greater than Mr. Bollea asked for, an indication of how strongly the six jurors condemned Gawker for posting the intimate scenes. The court could still add punitive damages.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/business/media/legal-experts-see-little-effect-on-news-media-from-hulk-hogan-verdict.html"}
