Kennedy, who was essentially an unknown senator at the time, destroyed Richard Nixon’s presidential bid because Kennedy was telegenic and confident, and Nixon was not.\nAnd it’s happening again in 2016, although the technology in question is not some newfangled social media platform or a magic app for getting out the vote.
