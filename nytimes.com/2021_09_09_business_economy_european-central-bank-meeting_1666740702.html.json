The central bank is still trying to secure a sustained recovery and get inflation to reach its 2 percent target over a longer period.\nTraders seemed to understand the message: Government bond yields drifted lower, and the euro was little changed after the announcement.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/business/economy/european-central-bank-meeting.html"}
