Also included are 457 plans, which are available to public employees and to workers at other tax-exempt institutions.\nThe limit on what are called catch-up contributions, for people 50 and older, also rose, to $7,500 from $6,500. That means workers 50 and older can contribute a maximum of $30,000 to those plans next year. The maximum contributions to individual retirement accounts will rise by $500, to $6,500.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/business/401k-contribution-limits-2023.html"}
