And the youngish-by-Saudi-standards — he was 44 at the time; his predecessor was 61 — envoy for King Abdullah virtually disappeared. From the gossip columns, that is.\nThe Obama administration’s charge this week that an Iranian-American car salesman backed by Iranian officials hatched a plot to assassinate Mr. Jubeir using a Mexican drug cartel has, by itself, made for riveting reading. But what it has also done is to push the soft-spoken Mr. Jubeir, who had been quietly managing his own reinvention as his king’s most trusted adviser on Saudi-American relations, back into the media glare.\nMr. Jubeir has not been too thrilled with the spotlight. “No, he’s not granting any requests for interviews,” one press aide at the Saudi Embassy said on Thursday. “People keep calling and calling — he doesn’t want to talk.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/world/middleeast/wild-days-behind-him-saudi-envoy-jubeir-keeps-low-profile.html"}
