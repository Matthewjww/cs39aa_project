(He also ascribed to Gentileschi a smaller painting of Mary Magdalene that hung nearby; it has already been restored and exhibited in Italy.)\nInvited by Barker to do an online presentation, he made a persuasive case for the new attribution based mainly on stylistic traits shared with Gentileschi’s known artworks, such as Hercules’s pose and her treatment of jewelry like cameo brooches and pearl drop earrings. He also noted that a similarly sized painting by Gentileschi on the subject of Hercules was recorded in 1699 in the Naples collection of Alonso de Cárdenas.\nBuchakjian’s visual analysis was convincing, said Barker, who calls the artist’s detailed and imaginative approach to jewelry one of her hallmarks.\n“She more often than not will use a notable level of invention or innovation, painting jewelry that may not have ever existed but was still perfectly in line with taste of her time,” she said, noting that Gentileschi’s grandfather was an esteemed jewelry designer who worked on the first grand ducal crown for the Medici dynasty.\nDating Gentileschi’s work is notoriously tricky, but Gasparotto believes that the damaged painting was made during a period when the artist lived in Naples, “which has always in some way been the black hole of Artemisia’s career — considered less important and interesting.” He added that it most likely dated to the mid-1630s based on similarities with Gentileschi’s “Bathsheba at Her Bath” and “Lot and His Daughters” that Buchakjian had pointed out.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/25/arts/beirut-explosion-artemisia-gentileschi-painting.html"}
