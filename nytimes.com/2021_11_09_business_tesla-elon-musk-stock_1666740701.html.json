Since Friday’s close, Tesla has shed about $200 billion in market valuation, though it remained just above the $1 trillion threshold as of the close of trading on Tuesday.\nOn Saturday, Mr. Musk posted a poll to Twitter asking if he should sell some of his Tesla shares, saying that he would “abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.” About 58 percent of respondents voted for him to sell shares.\nMr. Musk owns 17 percent of Tesla’s shares, a stake worth about $200 billion at the time he tweeted the poll. His weekend tweets were a pledge to sell about $20 billion of the stock.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/business/tesla-elon-musk-stock.html"}
