There is no better team on the planet, and I will savor every last step as I wander the lot in Burbank several more times this week, with this team on my mind always.”\nMr. Kilar was hired by John Stankey, the chief executive of AT&T, WarnerMedia’s parent company, in April 2020, just weeks into a pandemic and a month before HBO Max, the company’s streaming service, was set to debut.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/business/media/jason-kilar-warnermedia-discovery.html"}
