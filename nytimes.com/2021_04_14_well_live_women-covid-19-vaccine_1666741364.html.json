There have been more cases since then, and nearly all of them have been in adult women younger than 50 years old.\nThe blood clotting disorder has been found to be so rare, however, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on April 23 that use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine resume because the agency said the benefits outweighed the risks.\nIf you do receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a serious condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome during the three weeks following vaccination:\nSevere or persistent headaches or blurred vision\nShortness of breath\nChest pain\nLeg swelling\nPersistent abdominal pain\nEasy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin\nGetting vaccinated can change the way your mammogram looks.\nCoronavirus vaccinations can cause enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit that will show up as white blobs on mammograms. This type of swelling is a normal reaction to the vaccine and will typically occur on the same side as the arm where the shot was given, said Dr. Geeta Swamy, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’s Covid vaccine group. It usually lasts for only a few weeks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/well/live/women-covid-19-vaccine.html"}
