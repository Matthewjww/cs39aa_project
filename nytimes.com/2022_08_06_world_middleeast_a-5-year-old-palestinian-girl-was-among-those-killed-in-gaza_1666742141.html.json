A bright pink bow tied most of her hair back.\n“She was an innocent, little girl,” her grandfather said. “Was she launching rockets on the border? She was a child who wanted to see her whole life ahead of her.”\nAn Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, said Alaa’s father, Abdullah Qadoum, was a senior Islamic Jihad commander, but would not say whether he was targeted in the airstrike. The family would not comment on whether he was linked to Islamic Jihad.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/06/world/middleeast/a-5-year-old-palestinian-girl-was-among-those-killed-in-gaza.html"}
