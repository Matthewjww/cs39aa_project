Biden Jr. in the lead, but Trump supporters believe that could change as the last votes are counted.\nKeely Varvel, chief deputy recorder for Maricopa County, said counting would continue despite the protest. “We are still planning to finish up our scheduled ballot processing work and report out more results tonight,” Ms. Varvel said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/us/politics/trump-supporters-protest-arizona.html"}
