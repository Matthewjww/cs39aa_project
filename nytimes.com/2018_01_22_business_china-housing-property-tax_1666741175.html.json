It has plowed billions of dollars into building new homes that regular Chinese people can afford.\nNow the Chinese government is considering adopting something that, while familiar to homeowners in the United States and elsewhere, could dramatically reshape the world’s second-largest economy: a property tax.\nLiving in a place without property taxes may sound appealing, but a growing number of experts and policymakers in China say the absence of one has helped destabilize a vast and crucial part of the Chinese economy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/business/china-housing-property-tax.html"}
