Cuomo said that the child was 5 years old and the death — possibly from the syndrome — was under investigation.\nThe governor also said there had been 73 reported cases of children in New York area who had been afflicted with the illness, which doctors have labeled “pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.” He said the state’s Department of Health was investigating other deaths as possible cases.\n“This would be really painful news and would open up an entirely different chapter,” Mr. Cuomo said, “because I can’t tell you how many people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children were not getting infected.”\nIn an advisory to health care providers, state health officials said most of the children who were thought to have the syndrome had also tested positive for the coronavirus or for antibodies to it.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/nyregion/child-dead-new-virus-kawasaki.html"}
