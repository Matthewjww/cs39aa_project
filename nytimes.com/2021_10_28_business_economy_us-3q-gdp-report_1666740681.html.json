The supply-chain issues, by and large, are not.\nGross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew 0.5 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. That was down from 1.6 percent in the second quarter and represented the weakest growth since the recovery from the pandemic began in the spring.\nAs recently as July, economists predicted that the recovery would gain steam in the second half of the year as widespread vaccination allowed students to return to schools, workers to return to jobs and consumers to return to restaurants and hotels.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/business/economy/us-3q-gdp-report.html"}
