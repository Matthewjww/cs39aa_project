Amy McGrath, Mr. McConnell’s challenger in Kentucky, reported raising over $5 million more than the majority leader did, while Mark Kelly, the Democratic candidate in Arizona, reported raising over $4.5 million more than the Republican incumbent, Senator Martha McSally.\nWhile the Democrats running in reliably red states like Kentucky and Kansas may be betting on long odds, the party has won upset victories in those states in recent years, helping to fuel the hopes of candidates and donors alike.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/senate-races-2020-fundraising.html"}
