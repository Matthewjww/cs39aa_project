Cardona said in a statement announcing the change.\nThe federal government pays seven vendors to collect payments from nearly 43 million borrowers on $1.4 trillion in federal student loans. Government auditors and other watchdogs have repeatedly criticized the companies for shoddy practices and mistakes that they say have harmed struggling borrowers and raised the repayment costs for many people.\nMultiple state attorneys general have sued federal loan servicers over their missteps. In 2018, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary under President Donald J. Trump, sought to block those lawsuits by arguing that only the federal government had the authority to oversee and punish its federal loan servicers.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/business/states-federal-student-loan-services.html"}
