On June 20, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives next to a minibus shuttling Nepalese and Indian security guards to work at the Canadian Embassy, in one of the deadliest attacks on foreign contractors in the capital.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/01/world/asia/taliban-afghanistan-police-convoy-bombings.html"}
