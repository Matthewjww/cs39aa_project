And T-Mobile, which has a slower network than its competitors, is only just beginning to introduce major upgrades.\nThe company on Tuesday said the Apple iPhone 5 would be available starting April 12 for $100 up front, with customers paying an additional $20 a month for two years. Other new smartphones, like the Samsung Galaxy S 4 and the BlackBerry Z10, will be available with similar payment plans.\nAlthough T-Mobileâ€™s new phone plans require no long-term contract, customers would have to pay off the balance owed in order to end service prematurely.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/technology/t-mobile-unveils-aggressive-phone-pricing-with-no-contracts.html?pagewanted=all"}
