Biden Jr. was running ahead of President Trump, began circulating a conspiracy theory about the use of felt-tip pens at the state’s polling stations.\nThe viral rumor, which was shared by one of Mr. Trump’s sons, Eric, and other prominent Republicans, including some who called it “Sharpiegate,” alleged that poll workers had provided Trump voters with felt-tip pens to mark their ballots, which some claimed invalidated those ballots by making them unreadable by voting machines.\nBut Arizona officials said that there was no truth to that claim and that votes recorded with felt-tip pens would still be counted.\n“Those ballots are being counted,” Arizona’s secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, said in a local TV interview on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/technology/sharpies-ballots-arizona.html"}
