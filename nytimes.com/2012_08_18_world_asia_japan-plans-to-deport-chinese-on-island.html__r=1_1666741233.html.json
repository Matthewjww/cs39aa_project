The Japanese authorities said that the other seven were put back on the boat they had used to reach the island and were being escorted out of Japanese waters by the coast guard.\nThe 14, who included activists and journalists based in Hong Kong, were arrested on Wednesday after seven of them arrived by boat on Uotsuri, part of an uninhabited island chain in the East China Sea called the Senkakus by Japan and Diaoyu by China. The islands are controlled by Japan, but are also claimed by China and Taiwan.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/18/world/asia/japan-plans-to-deport-chinese-on-island.html?_r=1"}
