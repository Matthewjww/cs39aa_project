Dr. Duflo, 46, is the youngest economics laureate ever and the second woman to receive the prize in its half-century history.\nIn studying problems like education deficiencies and child health, the economists search for evidence about which interventions can resolve them, and seek practical ways to bring good treatments to scale.\n“In just two decades, their new experiment-based approach has transformed development economics, which is now a flourishing field,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the prize.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/business/nobel-economics.html"}
