Mark Sanford of South Carolina may have lost his wife after his tearful confession that he had traveled to Argentina as part of a yearlong extramarital affair, but he almost certainly will not lose his office.\nThe state House Judiciary Committee voted, 18 to 6, on Wednesday to kill a resolution to impeach the embattled governor, less than a week after his wife, Jenny Sanford, announced that she had filed for divorce on grounds of adultery. She waited until after a special panel of lawmakers said last week that it would recommend against impeachment.\nGovernor Sanford, 49, a Republican, issued a statement after the committee vote thanking the committee for its “deliberative approach” and “reasonable decision.”\n“As we’ve consistently said, this administration has tried to be a stalwart ally of the taxpayer, and will remain so for the next 13 months,” he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17sanford.html"}
