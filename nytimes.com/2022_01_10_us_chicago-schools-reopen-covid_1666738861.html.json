She added: “I’m glad that we’re hopefully putting this behind us and looking forward. But there does come a point when enough is enough.”\nThe deal, which city officials said included provisions for additional testing and metrics that would close schools with major virus outbreaks, was approved by the union’s House of Delegates on Monday night and was expected to be voted on later in the week by rank-and-file teachers.\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Lightfoot said she had tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing cold-like symptoms. The mayor, who said she was vaccinated and boosted, said she planned to work from home.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/us/chicago-schools-reopen-covid.html"}
