It was the latest in a series of increasingly frequent uprisings by migrants stuck in Greece after countries sealed the main route they had been using to get to Germany.\nGreek television showed migrants running from clouds of tear gas and falling to the ground as the wind blew toxic fumes into the encampment. More than 12,000 people, mostly women and children, have been stuck there for more than a month amid hopes that the border would reopen.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/world/europe/macedonia-greece-migrants-refugees.html"}
