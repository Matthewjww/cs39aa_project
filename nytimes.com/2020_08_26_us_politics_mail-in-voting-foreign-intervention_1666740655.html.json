Rosen, said in separate remarks for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\nIn July, and again this month, Mr. Trump raised the possibility, without evidence, that foreign adversaries would forge mail-in ballots and rig the election. He said the widespread use of mail-in and other absentee balloting was “going to be the greatest election disaster in history.”\n“You guys like to talk about Russia and China and other places,” Mr. Trump said in July. “They’ll be able to forge ballots. They’ll forge them. They’ll do whatever they have to do.”\nRaising the dubious prospect of forged ballots from Russia in particular contradicts Mr. Trump’s own deep skepticism of intelligence assessments that Russia interfered in the 2016 vote on his behalf, though there is no evidence that Kremlin operatives tampered with ballots.\nMr. Trump has more broadly stressed a difference between absentee and mail-in ballots — experts say they are interchangeable terms — and he and other administration officials have voted absentee. Critics accuse him of trying to undermine both mail-in voting and the post office because he believes expanded access to the ballot box is an advantage for Democratic candidates.
