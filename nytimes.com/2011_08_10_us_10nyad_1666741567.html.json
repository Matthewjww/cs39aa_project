But she kept swimming.\nAt 1:30 p.m. Monday, with the ocean swells now buffeting her, Ms. Nyad was struck by an asthma attack, her first ever, and struggled to breathe. But she kept swimming.\nNearly twelve hours later, halfway between Cuba and her destination of Key West, Fla., Ms. Nyad was treading water when she began vomiting. She then reluctantly allowed herself to be pulled aboard a support boat named the Bellissimo, where she was quickly wrapped in blankets. After swimming nearly 29 hours, Ms. Nyad abandoned her quest to complete the 60-hour, 103-mile journey, spread across three days, between Cuba and the United States.\n“It was my decision to stop and nobody else’s,” Ms. Nyad said during a phone interview Tuesday morning moments after arriving at a Key West marina. “I’m deeply grieved and disappointed, but I can hold my head up high. We pictured that moment of me crawling up on that Key West shore. We knew it was my year and my time, even at 61.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/us/10nyad.html"}
