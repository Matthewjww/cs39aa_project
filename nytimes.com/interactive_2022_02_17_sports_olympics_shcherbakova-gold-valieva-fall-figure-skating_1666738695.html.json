The heavy favorite — her teammate and training partner Kamila Valieva, 15 — stumbled from the beginning and fell on a quad toe jump to finish a disappointing fourth amid the maelstrom of a doping scandal.\nAnna Shcherbakova, left, and Kamila Valieva. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\nShcherbakova, who was second to Valieva after the short program, opened her free skate assuredly with a quadruple flip-triple toe combination and a separate quad flip. The reigning world champion, she again delivered on the sport’s biggest stage.\nShcherbakova began her winning long program with this quad-jump, triple-jump combination. The combination carried a base value of 15.20, and began with a quadruple flip. She followed that with a clean triple-toe loop. She earned 18.66 points for this combination, the highest score of her night’s routine. Photographs by Weiyi Cai and composite image by Jeremy White\nIn the most ambitious jumping competition in the history of women’s Olympic figure skating, no one performed more audaciously than another Russian teenager, Alexandra Trusova, who attempted five quads, landed three cleanly (including a salchow) and finished second.\nAlexandra Trusova’s quad salchow 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th 2nd 3rd 1st rotation 4th Photographs by Jeremy White and composite image by Weiyi Cai\nTrusova won the free skate, but she trailed Shcherbakova by more than five points after the short program and could not make up the gap in the combined score.\nFinal scores for the 2022 Olympics Short program Long program Total score 1 Anna Shcherbakova 80.20 175.75 255.95 2 Alexandra Trusova 74.60 177.13 251.73 3 Kaori Sakamoto 79.84 153.29 233.13 4 Kamila Valieva 82.16 141.93 224.09\nTrusova’s technical supremacy was not matched by her indifferent artistry. But quad jumps performed by the Russians have revolutionized women’s skating. Never had five quads been attempted by a skater in a women’s competition at the Games.\nTotal base points for attempted jumps Quad Triple Double or single Top four in Beijing Olympics 2022 Anna Shcherbakova Russia 59.6 2022 Alexandra Trusova Russia 75.6 2022 Kaori Sakamoto Japan 43.3 2022 Kamila Valieva Russia 65.5 Gold medalists in past Olympics 2018 Alina Zagitova Russia 45.4 2014 Adelina Sotnikova Russia 43.7 2010 Yuna Kim South Korea 42.7 2006 Shizuka Arakawa Japan 36.7 2002 Sarah Hughes United States 38.3 1998 Tara Lipinski United States 40 1994 Oksana Baiul Ukraine 33.8 1992 Kristi Yamaguchi United States 41.3 1988 Katarina Witt East Germany 28.4 1976 Dorothy Hamill United States 17.2 Note: The chart shows base points for attempted jumps using the current scale of values and does not include other elements in each skater’s long program. Jump combinations have been separated into individual jumps.\nKaori Sakamoto, 21, of Japan did not attempt a quad jump or a triple axel, the most difficult triple jump, but skated with speed and reliability and finished third, receiving the second-highest component, or artistic, scores to Shcherbakova’s in the free skate.\nKaori Sakamoto’s combination spin Photographs by Emily Rhyne and composite image by Weiyi Cai\nBecause Valieva did not finish among the top three, a medal ceremony was scheduled to be held; earlier, the International Olympic Committee had said it would cancel the ceremony if Valieva made the podium.\nAfter a confident opening, Shcherbakova landed two combination jumps and a triple lutz in the second half of her four-minute routine, when bonus points are awarded as skaters grow tired. She also received the highest overall artistic scores for such elements as skating skills, performance and musical interpretation.\nJumps attempted by the top four skaters Successful jump Penalized jump Alexandra Trusova Anna Shcherbakova Lutz Quad Flip Salchow Toe COMBO Axel Triple COMBO Lutz COMBO COMBO Flip COMBO Loop Salchow COMBO Toe Double Axel Halfway point Halfway point Kamila Valieva Kaori Sakamoto Quad Salchow Toe Triple Axel COMBO Lutz Flip COMBO COMBO Loop COMBO COMBO Salchow Toe COMBO Double Axel Toe Halfway point Halfway point Successful jump Penalized jump Alexandra Trusova Kaori Sakamoto Kamila Valieva Anna Shcherbakova Lutz Quad Flip Salchow Toe COMBO Axel Triple COMBO COMBO Lutz COMBO COMBO Flip COMBO COMBO COMBO Loop COMBO COMBO Salchow COMBO Toe COMBO Double Axel Toe Halfway point Halfway point Halfway point Halfway point Successful jump Penalized jump Alexandra Trusova Kaori Sakamoto Kamila Valieva Anna Shcherbakova JUMPS Lutz Quad Flip Salchow Toe COMBO Axel Triple COMBO COMBO Lutz COMBO COMBO Flip COMBO COMBO COMBO Loop COMBO Salchow COMBO COMBO Toe COMBO Double Axel Toe Halfway point Halfway point Halfway point Halfway point\nIn the team competition, Valieva became the first woman to land a quad at the Olympics. But a day later it was revealed that she had tested positive for a banned heart medication. She was permitted to continue skating when an arbitration panel ruled that to suspend Valieva in the middle of the Olympics, before her case was resolved, could cause her irreparable harm.\nValieva took first place in the short program but skated nervously from the beginning in the free skate, performing under intense scrutiny and pressure. She barely hung on for her opening quad salchow, then stumbled out of a triple axel and put her hand to the ice. She also stepped out of a quad toe in a combination jump, putting both hands to the ice after a triple salchow. She later fell on another quad toe.\nKamila Valieva’s quad toe loop Photographs by Emily Rhyne and composite image by Yuliya Parshina-Kottas\nEntering the Olympics, Valieva had been considered by many the greatest skater of all time, even though she made her debut on the Olympic-level skating circuit only last October. But after Thursday’s performance, Valieva waved her arm as if in disgust. After she left the ice, she cried.\nAll three Russian skaters have the same coach, Eteri Tutberidze, who will be investigated by Olympic, skating and anti-doping officials, along with other personnel in their Moscow training camp, after Valieva’s positive test. Shcherbakova and Trusova have not failed a drug test, but their performances will inevitably raise questions, especially after Russia’s state-sponsored doping system was revealed after it hosted the 2014 Olympics in Sochi.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/17/sports/olympics/shcherbakova-gold-valieva-fall-figure-skating.html"}
