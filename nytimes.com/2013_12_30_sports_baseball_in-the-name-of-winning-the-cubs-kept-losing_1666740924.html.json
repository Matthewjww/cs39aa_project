He appraised the talent on his 1966 roster and said, “This is not an eighth-place ball club.” That observation was more or less correct. The Cubs went on to finish 10th in the 10-team National League.\nWhy might this come to mind?\nIt has been two years since the Cubs hired the reputed baseball genius Theo Epstein as their president for baseball operations. The move seemed providential on Chicago’s North Side, where ordinarily, hopelessness has sprung eternal. After all, Epstein was the guy running the Boston Red Sox when they lifted the Curse of the Bambino. He was an Ivy Leaguer who understood sabermetrics. He looked spiffy in expensive suits.\nAnd yet the Cubs have suffered through the worst two consecutive years in their woebegone history, losing 197 games. The team last won the pennant in 1945 and has finished above .500 only 19 times since. The 2012 and 2013 Cubs have surpassed even their most feckless antecedents.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/sports/baseball/in-the-name-of-winning-the-cubs-kept-losing.html"}
