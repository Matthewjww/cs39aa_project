Or should surveyors drill down to the peak’s rock base?\nWhat about the recent earthquakes in Nepal, which geologists believe shrunk the mountain by about three centimeters, or a little more than an inch? Or the fact that wind speed affects how much snow covers the summit at any given time?\nThen there is the challenge of geography: Reaching the summit of Everest is only possible a few weeks each year, and measuring the mountain’s height from sea level has presented difficulties in the past. (Landlocked Nepal is a long way from the nearest shore.)", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/world/asia/mount-everest-how-tall-nepal.html"}
