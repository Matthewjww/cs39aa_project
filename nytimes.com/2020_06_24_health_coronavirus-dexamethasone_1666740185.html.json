Now the full study, neither peer reviewed nor published yet, has been posted online, and it holds a surprise.\nThe drug — a cheap, widely available steroid called dexamethasone — does seem to help patients in dire straits, the data suggest. But it also may be risky for patients with milder illness, and the timing of the treatment is critical.\nThe drug “may harm some patients, and we’re not entirely sure which patients those are,” said Dr. Samuel Brown, an associate professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City, who was not involved in the research.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/health/coronavirus-dexamethasone.html"}
