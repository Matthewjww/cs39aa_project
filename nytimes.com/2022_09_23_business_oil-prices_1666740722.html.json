But for now, the falling oil price has offered consumers some relief from inflation.\nOil prices had been rising for the better part of the past 12 months, and accelerated sharply when Russia invaded Ukraine in February. The U.S. benchmark oil price, West Texas Intermediate, settled at $78.74 a barrel, down 5 percent, and the global benchmark, Brent, settled down 4 percent, to about $86.15.\nThe average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Friday was $3.69, 20 cents lower than a month ago. The price would be lower if not for a fire this week at the BP refinery in Oregon, Ohio, which sent fuel prices in the Midwest higher.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/23/business/oil-prices.html"}
