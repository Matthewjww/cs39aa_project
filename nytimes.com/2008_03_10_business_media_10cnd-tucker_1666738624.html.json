Mr. Carlson will also remain with MSNBC, as a campaign correspondent who will cover the presidential race from Washington and the road.\nMSNBC also said that Andrea Mitchell, a veteran political correspondent for both the cable channel and NBC News, would lead another new campaign-oriented program, this one to be shown beginning at 1 p.m. weekdays. The channel currently shows regular news programming at that time.\nIn swapping out Mr. Carlson for Mr. Gregory, each in his late 30’s, MSNBC is hoping that a rising star of its news division  Mr. Gregory is also the lead substitute for Matt Lauer on “Today”  can succeed on MSNBC where Mr. Carlson, once a star himself on “Crossfire” on CNN, never did.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/10/business/media/10cnd-tucker.html"}
