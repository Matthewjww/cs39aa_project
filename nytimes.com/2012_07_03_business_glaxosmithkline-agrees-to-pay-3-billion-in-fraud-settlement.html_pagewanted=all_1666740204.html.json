The agreement also includes civil penalties for improper marketing of a half-dozen other drugs.\nThe fine against GlaxoSmithKline over Paxil, Wellbutrin, Avandia and the other drugs makes this year a record for money recovered by the federal government under its so-called whistle-blower law, according to a group that tracks such numbers.\nIn May, Abbott Laboratories settled for $1.6 billion over its marketing of the antiseizure drug Depakote. And an agreement with Johnson & Johnson that could result in a fine of as much as $2 billion is said to be imminent over its off-label promotion of an antipsychotic drug, Risperdal.\nNo individuals have been charged in any of the cases. Even so, the Justice Department contends the prosecutions are well worth the effort â€” reaping more than $15 in recoveries for every $1 it spends, by one estimate.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-fraud-settlement.html?pagewanted=all"}
