The big question Indians were asking Friday: What is he going to do with that?\nMany ask that question in hope, approving of the way he and his allies have already enhanced Hinduism’s role in public life, or of how he moved to help the poor and update the economy — or of both. This is what he has been doing his entire political career, simultaneously pushing Hindu traditions and modernizing India. Most analysts believe he will continue along this path.\nBut there is a sizable chunk of India that voted against Mr. Modi’s party, and many members of this anti-Modi crowd are deeply worried about his having a stronger hand.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/asia/modi-mandate-india-elections.html"}
