India’s actions, the Chinese said, were “a grave military provocation of a vile character.”\nIndian officials, however, denied their soldiers had fired any shots and said it was the Chinese who broke the long tradition of refraining from using firearms, a protocol in place for decades.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/world/asia/india-china-border.html"}
