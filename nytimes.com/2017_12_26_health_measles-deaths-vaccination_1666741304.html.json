As recently as the 1980s, measles killed 2.6 million people a year.\nThe decline — a public health triumph, as measles has long been a leading killer of malnourished children — was accomplished by widespread donor-supported vaccination that began in the early 2000s.\nThe estimated number of deaths fell to 89,780 in 2016, but the figure was released by the W.H.O. only in October.\nMeasles vaccines were invented in the 1960s. Since 2000, 5.5 billion doses have been given out, according to Gavi, the Geneva-based organization through which most donors support the vaccination effort. The group works with the W.H.O., the United Nations Children’s Fund, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation and others.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/health/measles-deaths-vaccination.html"}
