Bratton late on Tuesday announced a reshuffling of the leadership at the top of the New York Police Department.\nPhilip Banks III, the chief of department, will become the new first deputy commissioner, the second-highest-ranking position though one with fewer crime-fighting responsibilities.\nMr. Banks, a 28-year veteran of the department, rose to its upper echelon under Mr. Bratton’s predecessor, Raymond W. Kelly, and had been considered a possible candidate for Mr. Bratton’s job.\nHis elevation, while a promotion, represents a move away from the day-to-day management of the department’s 35,000 uniformed officers as chief of department, the highest-ranking uniformed position. That role, along with overseeing the department’s weekly CompStat meetings, will now fall to Chief James P. O’Neill, the current chief of patrol.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/nyregion/shuffling-of-top-assignments-at-new-york-police-department.html"}
