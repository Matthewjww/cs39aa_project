There was flooding in Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, too, but the worst impacts were in Germany, where the official death toll passed 125 on Friday and was sure to climb.\nThe storm was a frightening example of an extreme weather event, with some places getting a monthâ€™s worth of rain in a day. But in an era of climate change, extreme weather events are becoming more common.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/climate/europe-floods-climate-change.html"}
