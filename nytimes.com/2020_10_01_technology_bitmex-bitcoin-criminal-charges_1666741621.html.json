But it is the largest and most established exchange to face criminal charges.\nFederal prosecutors in Manhattan indicted the chief executive of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, and three co-owners: Benjamin Delo, Samuel Reed and Gregory Dwyer. Mr. Reed was arrested in Massachusetts on Thursday, while the other three men remained at large, authorities said.\nProsecutors said BitMEX had taken few steps to limit customers even after being informed that the exchange was being used by hackers to launder stolen money, and by people in countries under sanctions, like Iran.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/technology/bitmex-bitcoin-criminal-charges.html"}
