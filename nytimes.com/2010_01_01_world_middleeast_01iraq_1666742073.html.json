The bodies of three of the guards were recovered this year; the fourth is believed to be dead.\nMr. Moore was released Wednesday. The American military and the Iraqi government believe he was held by a militia called Asa’ib al-Haq, or the League of the Righteous.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html"}
