Doug Ducey of Arizona on Tuesday vetoed legislation that would have imposed some of the country’s most restrictive rules regarding L.G.B.T.Q. education, calling the bill “overly broad and vague.”\nThe bill, which was sponsored by eight Republicans and passed the Arizona Senate on a party-line vote, would prohibit schools from teaching about sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and L.G.B.T.Q. history unless a student received “signed, written consent” from a parent or guardian opting them in to the lessons.\nStudents would also be unable to receive lessons about H.I.V./AIDS unless they were opted in to them.\nParts of the bill “could lead to serious consequences,” Mr. Ducey, a Republican, said in a letter explaining his veto.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/doug-ducey-gender-sexual-orientation-aids-lgbtq.html"}
