They were set up to get money out the door fast. But one consequence of that strategy is that fiscal policy in the quarters ahead will subtract from economic growth.\nEconomists mostly project that the economy, with strong momentum in the labor market and huge pools of pent-up savings by households, will be strong enough to keep growing despite the fading of the fiscal boost. To avoid an economic downturn, a huge handoff must occur from government-driven demand to the private sector.\nThe mainstream view is that this will be successful. But there are aspects of this unusual economic moment that could make the road ahead bumpy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/upshot/pandemic-economy-stimulus.html"}
