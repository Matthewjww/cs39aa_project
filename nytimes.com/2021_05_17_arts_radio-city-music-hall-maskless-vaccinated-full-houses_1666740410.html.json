Andrew M. Cuomo announced Monday.\n“This beautiful hall will be filled once again,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference held inside the music hall. “Having Radio City back at 100 percent, without masks, with people enjoying New York, and the New York arts, is going to be not only symbolic and metaphoric; but I think it’s going to go a long way toward bringing back this state.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/arts/radio-city-music-hall-maskless-vaccinated-full-houses.html"}
