Jay Nixon of Missouri stepped to the lectern at a university here on Thursday afternoon, he confronted one of the toughest challenges of his political career: the police killing of an unarmed black teenager in suburban St. Louis and the violent unrest that followed.\nAs he announced that he had ordered the State Highway Patrol to take over command of the police in the troubled city of Ferguson, he was by turns defensive and resolute, sentimental and personal.\nHe pushed away broad questions about healing by saying, “We’re a little focused right now on operational specifics.” At another point, when asked about his relationship with the black community, he spoke of the relationships he had with “so many of my friends over so many years” and went on to say, “I don’t think this is a time to divide.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/15/us/politics/for-gov-jay-nixon-of-missouri-test-at-an-uneasy-time.html"}
