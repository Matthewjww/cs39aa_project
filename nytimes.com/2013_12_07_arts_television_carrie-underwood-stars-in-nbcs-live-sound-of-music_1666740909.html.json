Laura Benanti, who played Elsa Schrader, the wealthy Viennese socialite who sets her cap for Captain von Trapp (Stephen Moyer), had all the sparkle and mischief that Ms. Underwood, as Maria, lacked.\nTheir imbalance turned an ambitious television rendering of the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical into a Noël Coward triangle in which audiences root for the witty, wicked older woman: “The Sound of Money.”\nIt was a dissonance that reflected an underlying clash of two strains in pop culture.\nNBC tried to graft audiences’ abiding love for the 1965 movie starring Julie Andrews onto the current fascination with live reality contests like “The Voice” and “American Idol.” But those events feed on zippy glitz, Top 10 hits and the no-net suspense of ordinary unknowns, exceeding expectations or belly-flopping.\nThe show’s executive producers, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, are veterans with a knack for adapting Broadway shows for film (“Chicago,” “Annie”). Here, they didn’t want to duplicate the movie, but to pay homage to the original theatrical version, which has some different songs and different, more static stagings.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/arts/television/carrie-underwood-stars-in-nbcs-live-sound-of-music.html"}
