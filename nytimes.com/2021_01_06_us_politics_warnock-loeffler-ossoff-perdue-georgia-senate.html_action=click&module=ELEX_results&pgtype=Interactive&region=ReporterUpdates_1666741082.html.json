Though the Democrats will have the thinnest of advantages in the House and the Senate, where Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will break the 50-50 tie, they will control the committees as well as the legislation and nominations brought to the floor. That advantage will pave the way for at least some elements of Mr. Biden’s agenda.\n“For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate — and that will be very good for the American people,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who will become the new majority leader, said at a celebratory news conference in the Capitol before the violence erupted.\nThe Republicans’ losses in a state that Mr. Biden narrowly carried in November, but that still leans right, also amounted to a vivid illustration of the perils of embracing Mr. Trump. He put his diminished political capital on the line with an election-eve appearance in Northwest Georgia. And Mr. Perdue and Ms. Loeffler unwaveringly embraced the president throughout the runoff races even as he refused to acknowledge Mr. Biden’s victory, put forth baseless claims of voter fraud and brazenly demanded that Georgia state officials overturn his loss in the state.\nThe political fallout from Mr. Trump’s tenure is now clear: His single term in the White House will conclude with Republicans’ having lost the presidency, the House and the Senate on his watch.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/warnock-loeffler-ossoff-perdue-georgia-senate.html?action=click&module=ELEX_results&pgtype=Interactive&region=ReporterUpdates"}
