Saying that it wanted to send restaurants a lifeline, the City Council temporarily capped the fees that food delivery apps could charge, setting them at 15 percent for online orders and 5 percent per order for other fees such as marketing.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/business/food-delivery-lawsuit-ny-grubhub-uber-eats-door-dash.html"}
