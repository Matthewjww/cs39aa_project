Prosecutors on Thursday increased the top charge against him, and a judge said the case could proceed.\nState District Court Judge Robert H. Downer Jr. certified a first-degree murder charge and an array of lesser felony charges against James A. Fields Jr., who is accused of driving his car into a group of counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 35 others.\nMs. Heyer’s parents and many of the surviving victims sat in the courtroom, as a police detective, Steven Young, described finding “blood and flesh on the front of the vehicle” when he approached Mr. Fields’s 2010 Dodge Challenger, about a mile from the episode.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/us/charlottesville-fields-white-supremists.html"}
