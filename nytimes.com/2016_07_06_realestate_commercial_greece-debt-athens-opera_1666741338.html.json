In 14 years of tending his street kiosk, business had never been so bad.\nHe is holding out hope, though, that his prospects could soon change, thanks to a new cultural project nearby.\nA short walk away stands a complex housing the National Opera and National Library, three years in the making, at a cost of 566 million euros, or $623 million. It is aimed not only at revamping and reviving two of Greece’s most important cultural institutions, but also at providing a much needed jolt for the neighborhood that surrounds them.\n“Maybe things will improve,” said Mr. Niras, a tanned and graying 65-year-old. “They can’t get any worse.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/realestate/commercial/greece-debt-athens-opera.html"}
