It would be interesting to know that.”\nMs. Ernst’s comments seemed to repeat a false claim spread by President Trump on Twitter over the weekend, which the company removed for violating its rules against sharing disinformation because it is linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/joni-ernst-coronavirus.html"}
