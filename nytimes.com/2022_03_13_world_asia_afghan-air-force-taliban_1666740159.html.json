Trained by Americans to fight the Taliban from the air, they were some of the Afghan military’s most elite troops.\nNow they are on the run, hunted by the Taliban while moving their families from one safe house to the next. When the Taliban recently invited former air force members to join the new government’s fledgling air force, promising them amnesty, they never considered it.\n“No chance,” said one pilot, who said he flew attack helicopters on three dozen combat missions against the Taliban. “They would kill us, of course.”\nBut at least 4,300 former Afghan Air Force members have joined the nascent air force, according to the Taliban air force commander in Kabul and former government air force members. Among them are 33 pilots, the commander said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/world/asia/afghan-air-force-taliban.html"}
