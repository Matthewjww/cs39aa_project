It’s a low enough number to suggest he could still lose the nomination if the field ever narrowed to a one-on-one race.\nBut such a contest between Mr. Trump and anyone else now seems less likely to develop soon, particularly before the winner-take-all states on March 15. The results cement Mr. Trump as a very clear front-runner for the Republican nomination.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/upshot/results-show-why-trump-can-lose-and-why-he-probably-wont.html?ref=liveblog"}
