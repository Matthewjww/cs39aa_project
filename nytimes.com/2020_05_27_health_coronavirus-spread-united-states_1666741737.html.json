The revised timeline may clarify nagging ambiguities about the arrival of the pandemic.\nFor example, while President Trump has frequently claimed that a ban on travelers from China prevented the epidemic from becoming much worse, the new data suggest that the virus that started Washington Stateâ€™s epidemic arrived roughly two weeks after the ban was imposed on Feb. 2.\nAnd the authors argue that the relatively late emergence of the outbreak means that more lives could have been saved by early action, such as testing and contact tracing.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/health/coronavirus-spread-united-states.html"}
