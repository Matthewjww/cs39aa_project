Blige, DJ Khaled, T.I., Queen Latifah and Tracee Ellis Ross.\nThere was no charge at the door, no security, no drink minimum and you could attend in your pajamas from the comfort of your own home.\nThe party, named Homeschoolin’, was easy to find: It was on D.J. D-Nice’s Instagram live.\nSince Wednesday, Derrick Jones, 49, more popularly known as D-Nice, has held streams of hourslong jam sessions from his home in Los Angeles. He plays all of the hits, new and old, but you never hear the same song twice.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/arts/d-nice-instagram.html"}
