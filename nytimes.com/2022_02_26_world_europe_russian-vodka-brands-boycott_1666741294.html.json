Similar removals were underway in the provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland, Reuters reported.\nBoycotts of highly visible imports during times of conflict are nothing new.\nIn 2003, for example, France’s opposition to the United States-led military action in Iraq led some American politicians to boycott French wine and try to rename French fries as “freedom fries” (even though the dish probably originated in Belgium).\nAnd just as in earlier efforts, boycotting Russian vodka may be more symbolic than strategic.\nVodka has a long history in Russian culture, with The Times once describing it as “an inseparable part of Russian social life.” Colorless and odorless, it can be combined with countless types of mixers to make a wide array of concoctions. That versatility helped it take hold in the United States market, leading to a fierce competition among vodka makers from various countries.\nBut while 76.9 million nine-liter cases of vodka were sold in the United States in 2020 — generating nearly $7 billion in revenue for distillers, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade group — Russia’s share of the market isn’t as large as popular imagination may suggest.\nRussia accounted for a little more than 1 percent of the dollar amount of vodka imported into the U.S. in 2017, Thrillist reported, citing data from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/26/world/europe/russian-vodka-brands-boycott.html"}
