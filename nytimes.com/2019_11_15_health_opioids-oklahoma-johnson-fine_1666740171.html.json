The total is now $465 million, down from the $572 million he assessed in August.\nThe miscalculation came when he was assessing various costs to the state to deal with addiction and prevention issues stemming from opioids. In his August order, Judge Balkman listed the yearly price to train Oklahoma birthing hospitals to evaluate infants with opioids in their systems at $107,683,000.\nThe amount was actually $107,683.\nHe was alerted to the mistake by lawyers for Johnson & Johnson, whose accountants did what students have always been urged to do. They checked his math. They counted zeros.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/health/opioids-oklahoma-johnson-fine.html"}
