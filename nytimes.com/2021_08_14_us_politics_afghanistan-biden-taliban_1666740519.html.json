The president, in his statement, directed his secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, to support President Ashraf Ghani and other Afghan leaders as “they seek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a political settlement.” As part of the effort, Mr. Blinken will also contact top officials in the region, the White House said.\nAn administration official said that the administration would also reach out to the Taliban in the next day. It was unclear whether the outreach would go further than the warning Mr. Biden reiterated on Saturday, “that any action on their part on the ground in Afghanistan that puts U.S. personnel or our mission at risk there will be met with a swift and strong U.S. military response.”\nMr. Biden’s decision on Saturday to accelerate the deployment of an additional 1,000 troops to Afghanistan brings the number of American troops on the ground to 5,000. The Pentagon had announced this week that 3,000 forces would join the 1,000 already in the country as part of the effort to evacuate Americans and their allies. In addition, the Pentagon said on Friday that it would send an additional 3,000 from the Army’s 82nd Airborne to Kuwait as a sort of insurance policy, so they could be in the region if needed; the additional troops Mr. Biden ordered to Afghanistan on Saturday were among those bound for Kuwait.\nA senior U.S. official said Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief American negotiator with the Taliban in peace talks in Doha, Qatar, has asked the extremist group to not enter Kabul until the United States concludes evacuating what could be more than 10,000 American citizens, including Afghan-Americans, embassy staff and translators and other Afghans who have worked with the American government. It was unclear how quickly the evacuations could be completed or if that was even possible.\nTaliban officials have countered by asking that the United States cease airstrikes against its fighters as they take over cities across Afghanistan.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/14/us/politics/afghanistan-biden-taliban.html"}
