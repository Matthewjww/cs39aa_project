Among the unresolved issues is an Israeli proposal that its troops be allowed to remain in Gaza during the temporary truce.\nIt was not clear if the final plan would be endorsed by Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, or by the Israeli cabinet.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/25/world/middleeast/kerry-proposes-weeklong-halt-to-fighting-in-gaza-strip.html"}
