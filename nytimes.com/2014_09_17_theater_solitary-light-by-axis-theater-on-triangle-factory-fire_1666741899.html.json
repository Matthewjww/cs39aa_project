And there is a soupçon of philosophy about the camera and the nature of time.\nThe music (live with recorded augmentation, written by Ms. Sharp and Paul Carbonara) is fine — think of a briskly emotional and not unpleasing Disney soundtrack — and several performers are strong. Shira Averbuch, possessed of a winning voice and an enigmatically expressive smile, is a particular relief as the romantic lead.\nBut really there isn’t much the cast can do with this production. It’s maddeningly soupy: theatrical insult to historical injury.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/theater/solitary-light-by-axis-theater-on-triangle-factory-fire.html"}
