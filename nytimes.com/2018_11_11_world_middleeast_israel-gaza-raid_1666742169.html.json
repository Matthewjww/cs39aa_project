Reports in the Israeli news media generally described it as an intelligence mission that went awry.\nPalestinian militants responded with waves of rockets aimed at Israeli communities near Gaza, and Israeli aircraft pounded targets in Gaza for a time. With sirens going off repeatedly in the Gaza periphery, Israel ordered its citizens there to remain close to air-raid shelters and schools were closed on Monday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-raid.html"}
