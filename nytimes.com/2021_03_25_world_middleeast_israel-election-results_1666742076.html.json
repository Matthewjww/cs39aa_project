That will happen next Wednesday, a spokesman for the central elections committee said.\nBut the count confirms earlier projections that Mr. Netanyahu’s alliance of right-wing and religious parties won 52 seats, nine short of an overall majority. A heterogeneous collection of centrist, left-wing, right-wing and Arab opposition parties won 57.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/world/middleeast/israel-election-results.html"}
