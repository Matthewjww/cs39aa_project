But many senior American officials have said in private that evidence pointing to a lab accident is mainly circumstantial.\nMost scientists agree that the coronavirus most likely emerged in the natural world and spread from animals to humans. Peter Daszak, one of the experts on the W.H.O. team, described the conversation on Wednesday at the Wuhan institute as candid. “Key questions asked & answered,” he wrote on Twitter, without providing details.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/world/asia/who-wuhan-lab.html"}
