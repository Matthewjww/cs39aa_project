Navalny began his day with a rushed breakfast — just a cup of tea in a plastic cup — at the airport in the Siberian city of Tomsk. Soon after his flight took off Thursday, he rushed to the toilet feeling violently ill.\nJust a few hundred miles into its nearly 2,000-mile flight, the plane made an emergency landing, and Mr. Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition leader, groaning in agony before losing consciousness, was taken on a gurney to an ambulance waiting on the tarmac.\nMr. Navalny’s spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, who was traveling with him, announced on Twitter that he had been poisoned, probably by something put in his tea at the airport’s Vienna Café. Mr. Navalny, who has often described President Vladimir V. Putin as the leader of a “party of crooks and thieves,” had traveled to Siberia to help organize opposition candidates ahead of local elections next month.\nDoctors at the No. 1 Clinical Hospital in Omsk, the Siberian city where the plane made its emergency landing, initially said that Mr. Navalny was on a ventilator in serious condition. It later reported that his condition, though still grave, had stabilized.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/world/europe/navalny-poison-russia.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article"}
