The inn has closed temporarily and its owners have been fined after one such party there last month left 37 people infected with the coronavirus and forced over 270 into quarantine, officials said.\nMore than 80 people attended the Sept. 25 party, officials said, well above the 50-person limit imposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo as part of New York’s broader effort to keep the virus at bay.\nAs a result, Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday, what was planned as a celebration turned into a so-called super-spreading event.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/nyregion/virus-outbreak-sweet-sixteen.html"}
