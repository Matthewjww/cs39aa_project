The bill’s fate is uncertain in the Senate.\nThe White House called the demands “untenable” and said that the president would veto the bill if it reached his desk.\nThe sweeping majority of the House vote was a rejection of Mr. Obama’s moral appeal on the issue and the most vivid manifestation of the rapidly shifting politics within the United States, where Americans are at once war weary yet also frightened by the threats made by the Islamic State. More than two dozen governors, including one Democrat, have said they would try to block Syrian refugees from entering their state, and a recent Bloomberg poll shows that more than half of the nation agrees with them.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/us/politics/house-refugees-syria-iraq.html"}
