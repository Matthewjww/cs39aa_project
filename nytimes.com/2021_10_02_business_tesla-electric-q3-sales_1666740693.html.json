It was a 20 percent increase from the second quarter and 73 percent higher than the total in last year’s third quarter.\nTesla does not break out its deliveries by country. Much of its recent growth has been propelled by sales in Europe and China.\nOn Friday, major automakers including General Motors and Toyota said they had suffered recent U.S. sales declines because of a worldwide shortage of semiconductors as the pandemic’s disruptions have caused factory shutdowns and cargo bottlenecks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/02/business/tesla-electric-q3-sales.html"}
