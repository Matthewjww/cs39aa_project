Another bill, already approved by Parliament, would ultimately give the government control over who can even be considered for a judgeship.\nIn Brussels on Wednesday, a top European Union official said that if the changes were made, Poland might slip outside the bloc’s definition of a democracy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/europe/poland-courts-law-and-justice-party.html"}
