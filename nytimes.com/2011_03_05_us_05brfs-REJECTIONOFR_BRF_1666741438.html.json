Rick Scott’s decision to reject $2.4 billion in federal money to build a high-speed rail link between Tampa and Orlando, part of the Obama administration’s plan for a nationwide network. Mr. Scott, a Republican, has said he wants no part of the project, calling it a “boondoggle.” The ruling was in response to a suit filed by two state senators, who said Mr. Scott had exceeded his authority. The Transportation Department will evaluate options for making the funds available to other states.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/us/05brfs-REJECTIONOFR_BRF.html"}
