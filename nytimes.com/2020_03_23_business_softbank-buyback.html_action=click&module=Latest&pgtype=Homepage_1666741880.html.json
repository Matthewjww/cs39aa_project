The amount is on top of a ¥500 billion buyback announced earlier this month.\nTaken together, the company could retire as much as 45 percent of its outstanding stock, it said. The rest of the money will be used to pay down its debt and shore up its cash reserves.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/business/softbank-buyback.html?action=click&module=Latest&pgtype=Homepage"}
