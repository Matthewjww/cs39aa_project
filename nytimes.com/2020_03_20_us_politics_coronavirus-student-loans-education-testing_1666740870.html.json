Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act.\nThe department also announced that all borrowers with federally held student loans will automatically have their interest rates set to 0 percent for at least 60 days. Those borrowers can also ask their loan servicers to suspend their payments for at least two months without penalty, the department said.\nFor borrowers who may want to continue payments, such as those enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, the full amount of their payment will be applied to the principal if their interest payments are up-to-date.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/us/politics/coronavirus-student-loans-education-testing.html"}
