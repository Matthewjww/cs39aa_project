White Flint Mall, a once-upscale destination in the affluent Washington suburb of North Bethesda, Md., is now sealed and awaiting demolition. A half-hour’s drive to the east, in the economically and ethnically diverse Prince George’s County, the Landover Mall was torn down in 2006, leaving empty parking lots and one stand-alone Sears, which closed in early 2014.\nBoth properties belong to the Lerner family of Washington, who are also the majority owners of the Washington Nationals baseball team. Lerner Enterprises has said it wants to redevelop both sites, but there are few signs of it in evidence.\nOutside Akron, Ohio, the Rolling Acres mall has defied every attempt to redevelop it and now sits forlorn, with boarded-up windows and trees growing through cracks in the concrete. Before it was sealed, squatters occupied it and vandals pilfered copper wire for scrap.\nWhen it was thriving, “people would come from all over in busloads,” said Timothy A. Dimoff, a retired Akron detective who once advised on security at Rolling Acres. “Everybody in Akron still talks about the caramel popcorn in the food court.”\nOwings Mills may be on the verge of becoming a dead mall, but it is not in a dead-end market.\nThe original owner of Owings Mills, General Growth Properties, sold a 50 percent stake to Mr. Simmons’s company in 2011, and now Kimco is working to redevelop it into a hybrid of an open-air shopping center and enclosed mall.\nResurrecting a dead mall isn’t an easy process, however. Demolition of the old Owings Mills and construction of what is known in the industry as a “power center,” with big-box stores like Costco, Best Buy and Target, would cost $75 million to $100 million and take two to five years, Mr. Simmons said. He expects Owings Mills to persist in its current, zombielike state at least through the end of 2015.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/business/the-economics-and-nostalgia-of-dead-malls.html"}
