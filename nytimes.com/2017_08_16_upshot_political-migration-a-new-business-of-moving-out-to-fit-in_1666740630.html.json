San Bernardino County, which the Chabots left behind, leaned Democratic in the last three presidential elections. Collin County, Tex., where they landed, has gone Republican the last 13.\nIn the decade since Mr. Bishop’s book came out, researchers have intensely debated his thesis about how sorting happens, and the extent to which it happens at all. Do Americans really have politics in mind when they decide where to live? Is it possible that people who move for other reasons could bolster geographic polarization anyway? Or is today’s political map — Democrats in Los Angeles, Republicans in the Texas suburbs — more a product of voting patterns changing in place than of voters changing addresses? (Donald J. Trump’s win in Michigan, for example, wasn’t caused by lots of Republicans moving there.)\nMr. Chabot is saying out loud what is more often subtext in this debate. If there’s little evidence Americans think of moving as a political act — and even Mr. Bishop argued that sorting arises from behavior that’s not explicitly political — Mr. Chabot has declared that it is. Since arriving in Texas, he has even started a business on that premise.\nWhile others have mused about relocating liberals to red states to tip their elections, Mr. Chabot’s company, Conservative Move, wants to help conservatives migrate to solidly conservative places. He has turned the Big Sort into a real estate strategy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/upshot/political-migration-a-new-business-of-moving-out-to-fit-in.html"}
