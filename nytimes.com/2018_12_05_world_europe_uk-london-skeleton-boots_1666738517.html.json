They were not fancy, lacking heels or buckles, Ms. Richardson told The Guardian.\n“We never find high boots like this — they are always shoes or ankle boots,” she said. “High boots are just not very common throughout medieval times.”\nThe man is believed to have been at least 35 years old when he died, but his bones revealed that he probably led a painful life because of stiffness in his joints caused by osteoarthritis, experts said. His teeth show deep grooves caused by a repetitive action, possibly because of passing a material like rope between his teeth, as fishermen often did.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/world/europe/uk-london-skeleton-boots.html"}
