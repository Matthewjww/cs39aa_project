On Friday, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the stateâ€™s grid, said it would end emergency conditions as power is restored to households around the state.\nAbout 13 million Texans were told this week to boil their water for safety reasons, and cities across the state were opening water distribution sites.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/15/us/texas-winter-storm-photos.html"}
