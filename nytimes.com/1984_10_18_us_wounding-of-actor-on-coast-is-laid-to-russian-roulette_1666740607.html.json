The police closed their investigation of the shooting Monday, ruling it an accident.\nMr. Hexum, 27 years old, who shot himself on the ''Coverup'' television series set last Friday, underwent five hours of surgery at Beverly Hills Medical Center.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/18/us/wounding-of-actor-on-coast-is-laid-to-russian-roulette.html"}
