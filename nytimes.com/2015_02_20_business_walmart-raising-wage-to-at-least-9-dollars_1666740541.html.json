Some labor advocates, however, who are demanding $15 an hour for service workers, called the plan inadequate.\nThe pay raise also signals that a tightening job market â€” with the unemployment rate now at 5.7 percent, compared with 9.8 percent five years ago, is leading to higher wages. Walmart has had significant trouble retaining employees in a job market where its competitors like Costco Wholesale offer better wages.\nThe wage bump by Walmart, which has long been a pay laggard, could simply mean that wage increases are finally an inevitability for low-wage workers in America.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/20/business/walmart-raising-wage-to-at-least-9-dollars.html"}
