It ended with a triumphant jog around the bases.\nIn an endurance contest the night before the Boston Marathon, the Red Sox outlasted the Tampa Bay Rays in a 13-inning, chaotic affair in Game 3 of this American League division series. Vazquez, who had entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the sixth inning, won the game for Boston seven innings later with a walk-off, two-run home run over the Green Monster that gave the Red Sox a 6-4 victory and a two-games-to-one series lead.\n“It’s a big win,” Vazquez said. “No matter what inning, we need to do the job, and somebody needs to do it and take charge there, and I did it.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/10/sports/baseball/red-sox-rays.html"}
