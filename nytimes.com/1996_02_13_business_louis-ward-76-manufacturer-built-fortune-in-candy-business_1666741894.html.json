Ward, a businessman who built Russell Stover Candies Inc. into the nation's largest manufacturer and distributor of gift-packaged candy, died on Saturday at his home in Kansas City, Mo. He was 76.\nMr. Ward retired as president and chairman of Russell Stover Candies after a stroke three years ago. He died of complications from that illness, said his son Thomas S. Ward.\nThomas and his brother, Scott H. Ward, succeeded their father, becoming co-presidents of the family-owned business, which as a private company does not publish its financial results. Russell Stover Candies is based in Kansas City and has 50 retail stores, 5 factories and 6,000 employees.\nThe elder Mr. Ward guarded his privacy and objected to being put on lists of the richest Americans. \"I think that sort of thing is wrong in America,\" he said in 1983. \"I feel that lists such as this don't serve any worthwhile purpose.\"", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/business/louis-ward-76-manufacturer-built-fortune-in-candy-business.html"}
