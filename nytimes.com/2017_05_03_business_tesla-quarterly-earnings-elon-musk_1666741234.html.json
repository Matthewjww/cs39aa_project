(The figure includes revenue from SolarCity, the solar-panel maker that Tesla merged with last year; automotive revenue alone was $2.3 billion.)\nThe gains on the production side are being watched closely by investors and analysts who are seeking evidence that Tesla can meet its plans to begin manufacturing the Model 3, its first mass-market offering, this summer.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/business/tesla-quarterly-earnings-elon-musk.html"}
