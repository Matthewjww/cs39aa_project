Those games are scheduled to resume on Dec. 27.\nAnd the N.F.L. and N.F.L. Players Association on Saturday made a change to its testing protocols, the fourth such adjustment in a week.\nThey were the latest amendments to schedules and health rules pro leagues have made in lieu of stopping their seasons. With high vaccination rates among players and staff members, both the N.F.L. and N.B.A. have generally scaled back Covid-19 testing, which aligns with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the C.D.C., vaccinated individuals do not need to be tested unless they are exposed or show symptoms, advice that pro leagues seem to be embracing after previously testing with more frequency.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/sports/football/sports-covid-testing-postponed-games.html"}
