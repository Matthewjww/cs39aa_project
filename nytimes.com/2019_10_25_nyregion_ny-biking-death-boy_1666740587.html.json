He chose the model himself: It was bright orange, sprinkled with black and white dots .\n“He was so happy and excited to ride it,” said the boy’s father, Djahongir Djalolov .\nThe bike was big and heavy. His father or his older sister would usually carry it down the three flights of stairs from their Brooklyn apartment. On a recent Saturday, Dalerjon took it out for a ride with his friends.\nThe ride would be his last one.\nDalerjon, 10, was hit and killed on Oct. 5 by an unlicensed driver while biking steps from his home in the Kensington neighborhood. The boy’s 14-year-old sister knows her brother is gone, but his 5-year-old sister keeps wondering when he is coming back.\n“She is asking, where is he?” Mr. Djalolov said. “Is he coming already?” They tell her: “He is far away. When you grow old you will see him.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/nyregion/ny-biking-death-boy.html"}
