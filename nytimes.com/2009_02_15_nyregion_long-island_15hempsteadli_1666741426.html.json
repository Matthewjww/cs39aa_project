For more than a decade the property has been a financial sinkhole, costing taxpayers millions of dollars and diverting money from community programs, local officials say.\nAn audit this month found extensive mismanagement, and that report has stirred debate in the campaign for mayor in the March 18 village election.\n“The village has been screaming about this for years,” said the Nassau County comptroller, Howard S. Weitzman, who issued the audit. He said the managers “ran this thing into the ground.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/nyregion/long-island/15hempsteadli.html"}
