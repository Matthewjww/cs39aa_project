The final report is due to be handed to General Allen in the second half of March. Any legal action will be pursued under United States laws and regulations, not Afghan laws, a NATO legal official who asked for anonymity because the investigation was continuing said Wednesday.\nThe brigadier general in charge of the investigation has been at the Detention Facility in Parwan and the Bagram Air Base since Feb. 22, interviewing the people involved and inspecting the evidence, and was in the process of returning to the capital, Kabul.\nThe formal investigation overlaps with a joint inquiry that also includes three senior Afghan security officials from the Afghan Army, the National Directorate of Security and the Interior Ministry, who have been at Parwan and Bagram with the American brigadier general.\nThis joint inquiry will lead to a joint report that will be passed to General Allen for review, and that could then be released publicly as early as the next three or four days.\nIt is much more preliminary and its recommendations will not be binding, but it is likely to include much of the material in the formal investigation, and so could provide a snapshot of the issues involved.\nSimilar investigations were undertaken in the past when the American military defamed the Koran.\nThere have been at least two other serious instances, and at least one led to the punishment of military personnel. One group of incidents occurred at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, and the other in Iraq, when at least one soldier used a Koran for target practice.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/world/asia/koran-burning-in-afghanistan-prompts-3-parallel-inquiries.html?_r=1&ref=koran"}
