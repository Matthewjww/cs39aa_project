Donziger, as a brave David.\nBut on Tuesday, Chevron won a major victory. A federal judge in Manhattan ruled that a two-decade legal effort to punish the company was marred by fraud and corruption, making it increasingly likely that the oil company would be ultimately successful in beating back the legal and financial challenge.\nIn his nearly 500-page ruling, United States District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan did not dispute that pollution occurred in the Ecuadorean Amazon. But he did support Chevronâ€™s complaint that Mr. Donziger, a Manhattan lawyer, and his litigation team engaged in a conspiracy and criminal conduct.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/business/federal-judge-rules-for-chevron-in-ecuadorean-pollution-case.html"}
