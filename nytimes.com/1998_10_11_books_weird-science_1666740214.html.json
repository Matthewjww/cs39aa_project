Applying his knowledge of computer programming, Mullis mentally conjured up a technique of finding a specific sequence on DNA and replicating the hell out of it. ''Natural DNA is a tractless coil,'' he says, ''like an unwound and tangled audiotape on the floor of the car in the dark.'' The polymerase chain reaction makes sense of that tape. Now ''you could have all the DNA you wanted,'' he writes. And it's ''easy.'' P.C.R. finds and multiplies tiny fragments of DNA. After 30 doublings, for instance, you have a billion times as much as you started with.\nMullis explains: ''It was a chemical procedure that would make the structures of the molecules of our genes as easy to see as billboards in the desert and as easy to manipulate as Tinkertoys. . . . It would find infectious diseases by detecting the genes of pathogens that were difficult or impossible to culture. . . . The field of molecular paleobiology would blossom because of P.C.R. Its practitioners would inquire into the specifics of evolution from the DNA in ancient specimens. . . . And when DNA was finally found on other planets, it would be P.C.R. that would tell us whether we had been there before.''\nMullis submitted his paper to the two most prestigious science journals in the world, Science and Nature. Both rejected it. He had some consolation. On Oct. 13, 1993, a phone call from Stockholm offered him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. ''I'll take it!'' he said, displaying the decisiveness that has marked his career. He then called his mother to tell her she could stop sending him articles from Reader's Digest about advances in DNA chemistry.\nMullis grew up in Columbia, S.C., with a Gilbert chemistry set and a mom who gave good advice (''Now Kary B., don't you blow your eyes out!''). He has always loved chemicals: potassium nitrate, nitrosobenzene, phenacyl bromide, laughing gas, DNA, LSD. His mother sent him a Reader's Digest clip warning about the last item. LSD may also have kept him off the witness stand at the Simpson trial. By the time Mullis was scheduled to testify, the defense had destroyed the prosecution's DNA case, and Simpson's lawyer Barry Scheck felt that Mullis's personal life might distract the jurors. What would Mullis have told the jury?\nFirst, Mullis points out that the Los Angeles police lab conducts research in a manner that was abandoned by scientists 300 years ago. The lab took a sample of blood from the crime scene and matched it against blood taken from Simpson's arm. No real scientist would do this. There should have been several target samples, from other presumed-innocent people as well as Simpson, and the study should have been ''blind.'' That is, the technicians shouldn't have been told which was Simpson's blood; all the samples should have been cryptically labeled. Instead, the L.A. lab researchers were given one target sample of blood only. They knew in advance what the ''right answer'' was. ''The way they did it was like a one-man lineup,'' Mullis writes.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/books/weird-science.html"}
