While they continue to support the idea of Libra, the companies said, they will no longer be part of the coalition that is backing the effort.\n“EBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member,” a company spokesman said. Mastercard said it was focused on its own strategy “and our own significant efforts to enable financial inclusion around the world,” and Visa said its future participation would depend, in part, on Libra’s “ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations.”\nA spokesman for Stripe said, “We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/technology/facebook-libra-partners.html"}
