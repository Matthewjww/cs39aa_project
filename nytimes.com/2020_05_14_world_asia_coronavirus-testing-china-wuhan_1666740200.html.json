One hospital, Wuhan First, received so many calls from people asking if one member of each family could be tested, rather than the entire family, that state media published an interview with hospital officials explaining why some family members could be sick while others were healthy.\nAn official in one neighborhood told the magazine Caixin that he did not know whether to send all residents in his district to the hospital or invite doctors to come to the neighborhood.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/world/asia/coronavirus-testing-china-wuhan.html"}
