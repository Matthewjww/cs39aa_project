Stockholm, which was one of the six cities that made a formal application to the International Olympic Committee, withdrew in December largely because of cost concerns. This week, officials in Krakow, Poland, announced that the city would withdraw from the race after nearly 70 percent of voters rejected the plan.\nOf the remaining four bids, Oslo is also surprisingly on shaky ground because of faltering political support, and Lviv, Ukraine, is widely considered certain to fall away because of the crisis in the country.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/sports/olympics/bidders-for-2022-winter-games-are-melting-away.html"}
