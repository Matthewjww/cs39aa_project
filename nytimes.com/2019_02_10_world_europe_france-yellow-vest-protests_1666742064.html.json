Scuffles broke out near the Avenue des Champs-Élysées and by the National Assembly in central Paris.\nMotorcycles and trash cans burned as throngs moved in a wave through Paris, and protesters set fire to a car belonging to an antiterrorism unit in front of the Eiffel Tower.\nOne protester was severely wounded when he tried to pick up a “sting-ball grenade” used by the police to disperse crowds and it exploded in his hand.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/world/europe/france-yellow-vest-protests.html"}
