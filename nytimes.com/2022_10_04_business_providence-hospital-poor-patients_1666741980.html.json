The practice was the result of a program, known as Rev-Up, that was designed to maximize revenues by wringing as much money as possible from patients — even those whose incomes were so low they should never have been billed at all.\nRev-Up, which Providence created with the help of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, was the subject of a New York Times investigation last month.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/business/providence-hospital-poor-patients.html"}
