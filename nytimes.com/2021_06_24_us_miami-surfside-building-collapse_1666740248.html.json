On July 7, crews shifted from a rescue effort to a recovery operation, acknowledging that no more survivors would be found. The final toll came to 98 people killed in what was officially deemed one of the deadliest structural building failures in American history.\nHereâ€™s what we know.\nWhat happened?\nSurvivors said they were jolted awake around 1:30 a.m. by fire alarms, falling debris and the feeling of the ground trembling.\nPhotos from the scene show one side of the 13-story condo tower collapsed, with a giant pile of rubble below. An investigation into the cause has begun, but there are no conclusive answers yet.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/us/miami-surfside-building-collapse.html"}
