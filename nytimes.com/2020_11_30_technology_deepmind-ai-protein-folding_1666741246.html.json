They begin as strings of chemical compounds, before twisting and folding into three-dimensional shapes that define what they can do — and what they cannot.\nFor biologists, identifying the precise shape of a protein often requires months, years or even decades of experimentation. It requires skill, intelligence and more than a little elbow grease. Sometimes they never succeed.\nNow, an artificial intelligence lab in London has built a computer system that can do the job in a few hours — perhaps even a few minutes.\nDeepMind, a lab owned by the same parent company as Google, said on Monday that its system, called AlphaFold, had solved what is known as “the protein folding problem.” Given the string of amino acids that make up a protein, the system can rapidly and reliably predict its three-dimensional shape.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/deepmind-ai-protein-folding.html"}
