Mueller III.\nBut the prosecutors on Mr. Mueller’s team had a very specific goal in calling witnesses to testify about Mr. Manafort’s spending habits: to present the jury with detailed evidence that he wired millions of dollars from secret overseas bank accounts to buy and renovate homes in places like the Hamptons and suburban Washington, shop at the country’s most exclusive men’s boutiques and snap up one luxury vehicle after another with income he hid from the tax authorities.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/paul-manafort-fraud-trial.html"}
