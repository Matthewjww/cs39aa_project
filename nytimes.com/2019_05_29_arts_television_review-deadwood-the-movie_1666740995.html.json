Seeing him again, she says, her voice tremulous, is “as a dream might come alive to draw breath.”\nThere is indeed something dreamlike, otherworldly, about seeing “Deadwood” return, after 13 years, with the long-rumored, oft-doubted completion of a story that was cruelly interrupted after three seasons. You want to reach out and palpate its wounds, that you might believe.\nBut believe it. This briefly resurrected wonder, which airs on HBO Friday, looks like “Deadwood,” if grayer and touched by time. It sounds like “Deadwood,” the profane poetry and syntactic baroqueness of David Milch’s prose preserved as if in 100-proof whiskey.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/arts/television/review-deadwood-the-movie.html"}
