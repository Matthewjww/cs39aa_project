Lynch as attorney general on Monday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said she was uniquely qualified to bridge the divide between minority neighborhoods and police officers clashing over the use of deadly force.\nWithin hours, Baltimore was in flames, and Ms. Lynch was consumed by an issue that could define her time in office.\nMs. Lynch’s response to the tumult in Baltimore will be watched closely. Her predecessor, Eric H. Holder Jr., was the face of the Obama administration’s response to unrest in Ferguson, Mo., last year after a white police officer killed an unarmed black teenager there, and he relished the opportunity to talk about policing and race relations. It made him a hero of the civil rights movement but drew sharp criticism from police groups who said the attorney general did not do enough to support them.\nMs. Lynch, a career prosecutor, came into office promising to strike a new tone and planned to visit police groups this summer. But the riots in Baltimore after the death of a black man in police custody have overtaken that timeline.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/us/politics/turmoil-in-baltimore-provides-immediate-test-for-new-attorney-general.html"}
