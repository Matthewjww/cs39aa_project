Lieberman called the company and asked about the relationship.\nIn a statement, Amazon  which rents server space to companies in addition to its better-known business of selling books, music and other products online  said that it had canceled its relationship with WikiLeaks not because of “a government inquiry,” but because it decided that the organization was violating the terms of service for the program.\n“When companies or people go about securing and storing large quantities of data that isn’t rightfully theirs, and publishing this data without ensuring it won’t injure others, it’s a violation of our terms of service, and folks need to go operate elsewhere,” the company said.\nWikiLeaks, which began making public the first of a cache of more than 250,000 leaked State Department cables this week, apparently moved its Web site to Amazon’s servers in recent weeks after “denial of service” attacks had sought to shut it down.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/world/03amazon.html"}
