Amid an increase in athlete activism and rising political tensions worldwide, the organization has settled on strict — and specific — guidelines for the types of actions, gestures and statements competitors at this summer’s Tokyo Olympics will be permitted to make.\nNo kneeling. No politically motivated hand gestures. No political messages on signs or armbands. And absolutely no disruptions of medals ceremonies. The I.O.C. announced the guidelines Thursday after a meeting of its athlete commission, where the organization’s challenge was to balance growing demands from athletes to be able to speak out on issues with ensuring the Games pass without sparking diplomatic incidents.\nMany of the guidelines announced Thursday merely codify existing rules. Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter already bars athletes from staging political protests on the field of play or at medal ceremonies. But until now, the guidelines were ambiguous about what constituted a political display.\n“We needed clarity and they wanted clarity on the rules,” said Kirsty Coventry, the chairwoman of the I.O.C. Athletes’ Commission, which oversaw the creation of the three-page document explaining what is not permitted. “The majority of athletes feel it is very important that we respect each other as athletes.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/sports/olympics/olympics-protests-politics.html"}
