Two others who were pardoned declined to cooperate with prosecutors in connection with the special counselâ€™s Russia investigation: Paul Manafort, his 2016 campaign chairman, and Roger J. Stone Jr., his longtime informal adviser and friend.\nThey were the most prominent names in a batch of 26 pardons and three commutations disclosed by the White House after Mr. Trump left for his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., for the holiday.\nAlso on the list released on Wednesday was Margaret Hunter, the estranged wife of former Representative Duncan D. Hunter, Republican of California. Both of them had pleaded guilty to charges of misusing campaign funds for personal expenses.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/us/politics/trump-pardon-manafort-stone.html"}
