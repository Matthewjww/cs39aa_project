The returning homeowners now face more common problems that follow a flood: crumbling plasterboard, ruined furnishings and, above all, mold.\nStill, the accident at the plant has exposed large flaws in regulation of chemical safety, risk disclosure and emergency planning.\nBecause of a gap in federal environmental laws long criticized by chemical safety experts, Arkema was not even required to address, in the emergency plans it submits to federal regulators, the risk posed by the volatile chemicals that overheated and set off fires several times last week, sending dense black smoke billowing over this town near Houston.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/harvey-arkema-crosby-chemicals.html"}
