That was a sharp contrast with the 1970s, by far the most violent decade since the tracking began in 1970, the database shows.\nBut the toll of injuries in the double bombing in Boston, with 3 dead and 176 wounded, ranks among the highest casualty counts in recent American history, exceeded only by Sept. 11, the 1993 World Trade Center attack, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and the poisoning of restaurant salad bars with salmonella bacteria by religious cultists in Oregon in 1984.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/us/bombings-end-decade-without-terror-in-us.html?ref=nyregion"}
