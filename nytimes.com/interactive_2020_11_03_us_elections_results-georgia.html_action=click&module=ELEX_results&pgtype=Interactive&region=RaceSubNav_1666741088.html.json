Biden Jr. became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since 1992.

Raphael Warnock, who leads Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, beat Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican who was appointed to her seat in 2019 and was seeking to finish a term ending in 2022.\nBoth of races were forced into runoffs when no candidate won 50 percent of the vote in November.\nMr. Biden’s victory in Georgia was affirmed in three separate counts of the ballots: the initial election tally; a hand recount ordered by the state; and another recount that was requested by President Trump’s campaign and completed by machines.\nThat has not stopped Mr. Trump from making false conspiracy claims about his loss to Mr. Biden and seeking to overturn the election results, including by calling Georgia’s secretary of state and pressuring him to “find” votes that would reverse the outcome. But state election officials have repeatedly debunked Mr. Trump’s assertions of voter fraud.\nMr. Biden’s dominance in Atlanta, Savannah and the increasingly Democrat-friendly suburbs around both cities transformed what had once seemed to be a Republican stronghold into one of the most closely divided states in the nation.\n— Sydney Ember, Reid J.
