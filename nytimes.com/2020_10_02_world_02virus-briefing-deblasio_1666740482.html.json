Mr. de Blasio has said that if the seven-day average rose to 3 percent, the entire school system would again close.\nThe city’s health department wrote in an email that officials were focused on 12 neighborhoods where “cases continue to grow at an alarming rate.” The seven-day average positivity rate in those neighborhoods is 5.86 percent, compared with 1.17 percent for the rest of the city.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/world/02virus-briefing-deblasio.html"}
