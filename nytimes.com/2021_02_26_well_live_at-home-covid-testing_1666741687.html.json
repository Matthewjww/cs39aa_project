Unlike P.C.R., antigen tests do not amplify signals, which makes them faster but less accurate. These rapid antigen tests, Dr. Gronvall said, are good for measuring how contagious you are. “If you test positive on that, you really need to isolate,” she said, and get a clinical swab done to confirm the results.\nFalse negatives, however, are much more common with antigen tests, meaning infected people might think they are virus free, especially if they are not having symptoms.\n“The sensitivity of these tests tend to be pretty bad,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University School of Medicine. If users have symptoms, the BinaxNOW antigen test has a 64 percent chance of correctly spotting the virus (and about half that in those without symptoms). Accuracy for some antigen tests in asymptomatic individuals can be less than 50 percent — worse than flipping a coin, she said.\nThere is one exception to this among at-home tests: The Lucira test doesn’t rely on detecting antigens, but rather amplifies the message using a technique similar to PCR. That means they are more sensitive, with fewer false negatives, but the test is currently only available through a health care provider.\nRemember, any test’s ability to detect coronavirus depends on how much virus is in the location of your body where you are taking a sample. Tests taken early, say, hours after a potential virus exposure, have a higher chance of resulting in a false negative.\nWhat home test should you use?\nIf you’re asymptomatic, you may have a smaller amount of virus in your body. In this case, experts said that your best bet for an accurate test is to use a test-by-mail kit because P.C.R. will be able to amplify lower levels of virus.\nIf you have symptoms, either a P.C.R.-based test or an antigen test will likely be able to confirm you have it. When choosing an antigen test, Dr. Jha said to look for whichever option at your disposal has the highest sensitivity, which refers to a test’s ability to detect the virus. Look for a sensitivity rating from 95 to 99 percent, he said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/well/live/at-home-covid-testing.html"}
