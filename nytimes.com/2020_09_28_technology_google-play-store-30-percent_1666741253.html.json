Google said companies had until Sept. 30, 2021, to integrate its billing systems.\nThe way the Google and Apple app stores collect fees has become an especially contentious issue in recent months after Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules with the commissions they charge.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/technology/google-play-store-30-percent.html"}
