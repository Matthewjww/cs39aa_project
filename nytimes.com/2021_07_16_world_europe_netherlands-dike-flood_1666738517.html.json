Hours before, thousands had been told to evacuate after the dike was breached along the canal, a 22-mile waterway that regulates the Meuse River.\nThe riverâ€™s water level is at heights not witnessed since 1911, the Dutch national broadcaster NOS reported.\nThat is no small thing in a water-logged country where taming water has been a matter of survival for centuries and the imperative to keep levels under control is inextricably bound up with Dutch identity. Much of the country sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Climate change has also exacerbated the twin threats of storms and rising tides.\nResidents of the villages of Brommelen, Bunde, Geulle and Voulwames were ordered to evacuate immediately, after initially being told to move to higher floors in their homes. About 10,000 people live in the area.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/world/europe/netherlands-dike-flood.html"}
