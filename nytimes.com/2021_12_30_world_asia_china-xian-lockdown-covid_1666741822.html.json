In response, officials locked down the city of 13 million on Dec. 22, closing schools and most businesses and largely barring people from leaving home.\nThey ordered daily testing for residents of several districts, setting up nearly 12,000 sampling stations and deploying more than 160,000 workers. Other workers were ordered to spray the city with clouds of disinfectant for a “full-scale” deep cleaning.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/world/asia/china-xian-lockdown-covid.html"}
