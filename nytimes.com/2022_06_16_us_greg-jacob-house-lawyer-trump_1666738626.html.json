Trump to use the vice president to nullify the 2020 outcome, admitted to him that the strategy was illegal.\nMr. Jacob played a pivotal role in the days before the Jan. 6 attack, advising Mr. Pence not to go along with the pressure campaign by Mr. Trump to throw out legitimate electoral votes for Joseph R. Biden Jr. A memo written by Mr. Jacob warned the vice president that he would most likely lose in court if he delayed the vote certification.\nMr. Jacob is planning to testify on Thursday that it was abundantly clear that the vice president had no lawful power to throw out legitimate election results.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/us/greg-jacob-house-lawyer-trump.html"}
