He was 84.\nHis daughter, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, announced his death in a post on Medium. His family declined to cite the cause.\nStarting in the 1960s, Mr. Arrillaga developed Silicon Valley’s bucolic farmland into a sprawling network of corporate campuses. At the time, the semiconductor industry was taking off in the Santa Clara Valley, with companies like Intel growing as quickly as they could find buildings to expand into.\nTo meet that demand, Mr. Arrillaga and his business partner, Richard Peery, bought up thousands of acres of farmland around California towns including Mountain View, Sunnyvale and San Jose. Even before they secured tenants, they created developments of low-slung concrete buildings that were cheap and easy to build.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/technology/john-arrillaga-sr-dead.html"}
