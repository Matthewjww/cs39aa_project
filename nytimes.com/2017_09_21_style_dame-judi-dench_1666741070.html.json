At 82, she is just as elegant as you would imagine, with silver hair, ice-blue eyes and crisp diction. She’s 5-foot-1, but her reputation is towering.\nMs. Dench is one of the greatest British actresses — a star alum of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Sally Bowles in the London production of “Cabaret” and an Oscar winner for her eight-minute turn as Queen Elizabeth I in “Shakespeare in Love.”\nShe died in James Bond’s arms, as the murdered spymaster M. And she has portrayed so many queens on stage and screen that when she plays a duchess, it seems like a demotion.\nSo what to talk about with this regal creature?\nWell, what else? Lingerie, tattoos, rap music, younger men, sex and her hobby of embroidering cushions with raunchy sayings.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/style/dame-judi-dench.html"}
