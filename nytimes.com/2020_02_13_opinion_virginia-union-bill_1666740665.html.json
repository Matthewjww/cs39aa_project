You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.\nVirginia is notably hostile to labor unions. It’s one of only three states to ban government workers from bargaining collectively, and it also puts legal obstacles in the way of private sector unions.\nNot surprisingly, after Democrats took control of Virginia’s state legislature this year, they began considering a bill to make it easier for unions to enroll workers. Economic research has found that unionized workers earn roughly 15 percent more on average than otherwise similar workers who aren’t in a union.\nBut, even as the Virginia legislature was passing a raft of other progressive legislation, the union bill died. One big factor appears to have been an economic analysis by a local business development group predicting that the bill would hurt the state’s economy.
