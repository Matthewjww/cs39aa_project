It is the first time that has happened since 1968.\nThose games will be played on March 29, the earliest start for domestic games in history. Games have been played on March 30 several times, most recently in 2014.\nThe early date was motivated by new collective bargaining rules that mandate more rest time for teams. The 2018 schedule will have three or four extra days off per team.\nWhether intentional or not, there are few games in outdoor stadiums in colder climes the first few days, with only Baltimore, Detroit, Cincinnati and the Mets hosting games.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/sports/baseball/mlb-opening-day-schedule.html"}
