It was one of the first major retailers to install an elevator in its store and was one of the first to hire a woman as president.\nNow, Lord & Taylor has unveiled another milestone, although one that speaks less to the retailer’s glory days and more to the challenges of modern retailing.\nLord & Taylor is teaming up with Walmart to create an online store on Walmart.com that will offer about 125 fashion brands, including Tommy Bahama, La La Anthony, H Halston and Effy.\nBilled by both companies as a “premium” shopping destination, the new online store reflects Lord & Taylor’s desire to reach a wider audience and Walmart’s hope to attract a different type of customer.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/business/walmart-lord-and-taylor-website.html"}
