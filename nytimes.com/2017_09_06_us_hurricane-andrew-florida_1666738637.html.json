Rick Scott of Florida said on Wednesday that Hurricane Irma, projected to make landfall in the state on Sunday, would be stronger than Hurricane Andrew, those who lived through that August 1992 storm would have had little doubt about the seriousness of the warning.\nIf invoking the name of Andrew didn’t bring back unpleasant memories, here’s a refresher on one of the biggest natural disasters in American history.\nThe storm was blamed for 61 deaths and an estimated $27 billion in damage, or $47.8 billion in 2017 dollars, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the time it was the costliest hurricane in United States history; it has since been passed by Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012.\nAndrew hit especially hard in Dade County, home to Miami, where more than 125,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and 160,000 people were left homeless. The storm displaced 250,000 people in all.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/us/hurricane-andrew-florida.html"}
