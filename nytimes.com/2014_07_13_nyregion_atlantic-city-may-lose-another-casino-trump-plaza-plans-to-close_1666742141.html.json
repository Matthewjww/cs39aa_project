But the company said it expected the casino to close its doors on Sept. 16.\nNotices warning employees of the expected closing will go out to the casino’s 1,000-plus employees on Monday.\nIf Trump Plaza closes, Atlantic City could lose a third of its casinos and a quarter of its casino work force in less than nine months. The Atlantic Club closed in January, the Showboat is closing next month and Revel might do likewise if a buyer cannot be found in bankruptcy court.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/nyregion/atlantic-city-may-lose-another-casino-trump-plaza-plans-to-close.html"}
