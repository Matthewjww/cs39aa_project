To a nation battered by Vietnam, damaged by Watergate and humiliated by the taking of hostages in Iran, Ronald Reagan held out the promise of a return to greatness, the promise that America would ''stand tall'' again.\nHe managed to project the optimism of Franklin D.

Gorbachev.\nRead full obituary", "filename": "topic_person_ronald-reagan_1666741645.html", "image_url": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "language": "en", "localpath": "/Users/matthewwhite/news-please-repo//data/2022/10/25/nytimes.com/topic_person_ronald-reagan_1666741645.html", "title": "Ronald Reagan", "title_page": "Ronald Reagan - The New York Times", "title_rss": "NULL", "source_domain": "nytimes.com", "maintext": "White House memo\nHow Reagan and Bush Overcame Skepticism to Collaborate With Gorbachev\nMr. Gorbachev was charming and presented himself as a modernizer, but neither Ronald Reagan nor George Bush was convinced he was for real.
