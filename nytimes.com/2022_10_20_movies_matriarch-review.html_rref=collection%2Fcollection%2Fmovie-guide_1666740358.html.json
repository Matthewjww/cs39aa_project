The director, Ben Steiner, spends nearly a quarter of the running time cataloging ways she is troubled. Laura struggles with drug and alcohol abuse, with apparent bulimia and with staying out of others’ parenting. She chastises a stranger for not feeding a baby quickly enough and tells off her concerned boss (Franc Ashman) by invoking the boss’s dead daughter.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/20/movies/matriarch-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Fmovie-guide"}
