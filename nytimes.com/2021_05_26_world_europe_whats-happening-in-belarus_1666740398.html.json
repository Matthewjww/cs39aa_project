Lukashenko, in a new global spotlight.\nIt came less than a year after Belarusians were met with a violent police crackdown when they protested the results of an election that many Western governments derided as a sham.\nThe Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, was diverted to Minsk using the ruse of a bomb threat, according to Western governments, with the goal of detaining Roman Protasevich, a 26-year-old dissident journalist. In a video released by the government, he confessed to taking part in organizing “mass unrest” last year, but friends say the confession was made under duress.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/world/europe/whats-happening-in-belarus.html"}
