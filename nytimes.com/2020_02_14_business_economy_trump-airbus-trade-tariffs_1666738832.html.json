It also removed prune juice for the list of taxed items, and added a 25 percent tax on French and German butcher and kitchen knives.\nThe annual value of the goods subject to tariffs would remain at $7.5 billion, as before, the trade representative said.\nThe tariffs are part of a 15-year-old complaint over subsidies European governments gave plane maker Airbus, which put its American competitor, Boeing, at a disadvantage. In October, the World Trade Organization granted the United States permission to try to recoup its losses by taxing as much as $7.5 billion of European exports annually. Those tariffs are expected to continue until Europe removes its subsidies or the two governments come to a negotiated resolution.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/business/economy/trump-airbus-trade-tariffs.html"}
