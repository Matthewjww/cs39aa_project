But in Parliament on Wednesday, faced with a corruption scandal and bad news on other fronts, his Houdini-like skills deserted him.\nMr. Johnson spluttered as the leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, demanded he apologize for his role in the furor over Conservative Party lawmakers taking lucrative outside work. It was part of a pattern of reversals and broken promises, the Labour leader said, that included the government’s likely retreat on a high-speed rail link between northern cities.\n“Everybody else has apologized for him, but he won’t apologize for himself,” Mr. Starmer thundered. “A coward, not a leader.”\nIt has been a brutal stretch for a prime minister who only two weeks ago was hosting world leaders at a climate conference in Glasgow.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/world/europe/boris-johnson-britain.html"}
