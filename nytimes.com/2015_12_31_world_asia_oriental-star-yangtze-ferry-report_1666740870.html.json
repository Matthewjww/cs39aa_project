Of the 454 people onboard, 442 died, and the accident became one of several in China in 2015 that ignited accusations that lax regulations, bungled decisions by officials and even corruption had created the conditions for such calamities.\nBut the investigation, overseen by the Chinese central government, concluded that the disaster was primarily the result of extraordinarily destructive weather, according to the report issued on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/world/asia/oriental-star-yangtze-ferry-report.html"}
