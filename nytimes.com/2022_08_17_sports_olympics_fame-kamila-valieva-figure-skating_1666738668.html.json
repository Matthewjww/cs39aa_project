It was the perfect Olympic story. Until it wasn’t.\nShe was a figure skater of just 15 out of Moscow, but seemingly out of nowhere, when she broke world scoring records again and again. A long-limbed balletic beauty, she knocked out quadruple jumps as if she were skipping rope on a sidewalk. The lovely soft shapes she formed with her arms during difficult routines were enough to mesmerize an audience.\nWhen the Beijing Games began in February with Valieva as the heavy favorite, who knew that this star was more like a supernova, and ready to explode?\nShe kicked off her Winter Games by leading Russia to the gold medal in the team figure skating event. That competition pits each country’s best skaters and ice dancers against each other, and she rose above them all, achieving instant worldwide fame and affirmation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/sports/olympics/fame-kamila-valieva-figure-skating.html"}
