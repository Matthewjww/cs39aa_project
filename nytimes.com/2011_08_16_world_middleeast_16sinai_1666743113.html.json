In that attack, in the provincial capital of El Arish, gunmen launched rocket-propelled grenades and fought a nine-hour firefight with the police before escaping unharmed.\nThe North Sinai region is dominated by Bedouin tribes and is a perennial hotbed of illegal weapons sales, smuggling and other activities. The Egyptian police have never been very welcome there, and in the six months since the Egyptian revolution they have all but vanished, leaving local Bedouin tribes to provide the only law and order.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/16/world/middleeast/16sinai.html"}
