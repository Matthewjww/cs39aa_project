That distinction was previously held by another copy of the same game, which sold for $114,000 in July.\nThe game that sold on Friday was purchased as a Christmas gift in 1986 but it had been placed in a desk drawer, where it remained undisturbed for 35 years, the statement said.\n“It stayed in the bottom of my office desk this whole time since the day I bought it,” the seller, who asked not to be identified, told Heritage Auctions. “I never thought anything about it.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/business/super-mario-bros-nintendo-auction.html"}
