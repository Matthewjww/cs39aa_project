I am a woman, I am an artist, and I know where my voice belongs.”\nRalph won an Emmy for best supporting actress in a comedy for her role as Barbara Howard, a no-nonsense kindergarten teacher, in “Abbott Elementary.” Ralph, 65, who has been a screen actress since the 1970s and has performed on Broadway since the 1980s, was full of emotion as she accepted her award — which followed her first-ever nomination.\n“To anyone who has ever, ever had a dream and thought your dream wasn’t, wouldn’t, couldn’t come true,” Ralph said, “I am here to tell you that this is what believing looks like. This is what striving looks like. And don’t you ever, ever give up on you.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/12/arts/television/sheryl-lee-ralph-emmy.html"}
