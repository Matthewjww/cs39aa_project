But the question of what the ethnic cores of their political bases might do — largely Pashtun for Mr. Ghani, and largely Tajik for Mr. Abdullah — has loomed over the deepening political deadlock in recent weeks.\nThat crisis had seemed to ebb in recent days, as the campaigns of Mr. Abdullah, a former foreign minister who ran for president against Hamid Karzai in 2009, and Mr. Ghani, a former finance minister and World Bank official, began meeting to thrash out an agreement on how much of the vote would be subjected to an audit. At the same time, United Nations and American officials separately pressed cases for a widespread audit.\nThe talks continued into Monday, and it remained unclear throughout much of the day whether the country’s Independent Election Commission would announce the preliminary results, which had already been delayed for days. The American ambassador, James B. Cunningham, and Jan Kubis, the United Nations special envoy for Afghanistan, took part in at least some of the meetings, officials said.\nThe announcement finally came just as Afghans were breaking their daily Ramadan fasts, and it appeared to catch the Abdullah camp off guard, fulfilling what many campaign officials had described as one of their worst fears in the weeks since the June 14 runoff.\nThe ballot total reported by the commission was around a million votes higher than the seven million votes it estimated in June — a figure that itself had immediately led to protests from Mr. Abdullah’s campaign, saying the total had been vastly inflated by ballot box stuffing and highly improbable turnout numbers in areas that had supported Mr. Ghani in the first round. In the weeks since, the process has been fraught with tension over Mr. Abdullah’s boycott and accusations of systemic vote-rigging.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/world/asia/afghan-preliminary-results-put-ashraf-ghani-ahead-of-abdullah-abdullah.html"}
