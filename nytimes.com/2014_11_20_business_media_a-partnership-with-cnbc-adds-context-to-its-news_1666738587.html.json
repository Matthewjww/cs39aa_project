The analytics will tell viewers and visitors to the CNBC website, for example, how energy stocks have historically responded after a huge snowstorm, or how stocks of Apple suppliers have typically performed after an iPhone release.\nThe analysis will show up in formats that the network is calling a Kensho Stats Box, after the start-up behind the software that makes the information available nearly instantly. (NBC likened it to the sports ticker that automatically updates player stats on ESPN.)\nNBCUniversal News Group is announcing a strategic investment in Kensho that includes a larger agreement specifically with CNBC. Kensho’s software will be used to conduct the analysis. Additionally, CNBC will provide Kensho with content — including breaking news — for integration into Kensho’s platform.\nIn a news release, the companies said that they would also collaborate on digital products that bring “actionable insights and analytics to ordinary investors.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/business/media/a-partnership-with-cnbc-adds-context-to-its-news.html"}
