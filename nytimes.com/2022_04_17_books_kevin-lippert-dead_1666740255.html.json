But these books were old, fragile, oversized and cumbersome, and access to them was limited.\nIt occurred to him that if they could be reprinted in smaller formats and made available at a reasonable price, students would happily pay for them.\nAnd so he gave his idea a whirl. He persuaded the school’s librarians to let him take out rare books and copy them; if students had their own copies, he argued, they would not be damaging the originals.\nIn a pilot project, he experimented first with “Recueil et Parallèle des Edifices de Tout Genre” (“Survey and Comparison of Buildings of All Types”), a book published in 1800 by the French architect Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand. He made elaborate copies in large sheets measuring 20 by 26 inches and placed them in wooden boxes, the better to preserve them. At $300 apiece, they were beautiful but not very practical.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/17/books/kevin-lippert-dead.html"}
