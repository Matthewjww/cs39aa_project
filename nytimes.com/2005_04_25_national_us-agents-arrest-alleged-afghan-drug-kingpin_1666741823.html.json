Kelley, the United States attorney in Manhattan.\nMr. Kelley declined to provide many details about how and where Mr. Noorzai was arrested, saying that he had been \"traveling to New York\" and had been caught \"somewhere along the way.\" He faces a minimum 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a maximum of life. The government is also seeking to recover $50 million in illegal narcotics gains.\nIn a brief first court appearance this afternoon before a magistrate judge in federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Noorzai, looking slightly dazed, spoke only to acknowledge that he understood the judge's statements as they were translated to him by an interpreter of the Pashto language. Boyd Johnson, the federal prosecutor in charge of the case, said Mr. Noorzai, 44, had been arrested Saturday afternoon in New York by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration. He did not say how or why Mr. Noorzai had come to New York.\nMagistrate Judge Douglas F. Eaton appointed a lawyer to represent Mr. Noorzai free of charge. The lawyer, David Greenfield, said Mr. Noorzai was \"new to the country\" and had no assets here. Mr. Noorzai is to remain in detention until a bail hearing on Wednesday. Mr. Noorzai, wearing dark blue polo shirt and blue pants, told the court that he had a history of asthma but would not require special medical treatment.\nMr. Noorzai gave no sign in the subdued hearing, which lasted less than 10 minutes, of being the mighty reputed warlord said to dominate a heroin trade that brought more than $2 billion to Afghanistan last year, according to the D.E.A.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/25/national/us-agents-arrest-alleged-afghan-drug-kingpin.html"}
