That doesn’t mean we are going to agree to it, but all they have to do is make a deal.”\nThe Postal Service has said regularly that it can handle any surge in volume from mail balloting this fall. More than three-quarters of voters will be able to cast their ballots by mail this year.\nMr. Trump has assailed the money-losing Postal Service in recent months, at the same time warning that voting by mail will lead to fraud, lost or stolen ballots and long delays in determining a winner. (On Wednesday, both the president and the first lady, Melania Trump, were mailed ballots, Palm Beach County, Fla., election records show. It was first reported by The Palm Beach Post. Late Thursday, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said, “The president supports absentee voting, not universal mail-in voting, which contain several safeguards that prevent fraud and abuse.”)\nThe appointment as postmaster general in May of Louis DeJoy, a Trump campaign contributor with significant financial interests in the Postal Service’s competitors and contractors, has prompted further concerns about the politicization of the agency, particularly after Mr. DeJoy put in place policy changes that have slowed mail delivery in some areas.\nHow Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause.

However, he sold his stake in United Parcel Service, a major rival for the post office, in June, according to financial disclosures.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/trump-postal-service-mail-voting.html"}
