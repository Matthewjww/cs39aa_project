Saudi Arabia has now provided each of the four with a house in the family’s home city of Jidda worth about $4 million in addition to a steady stream of cash payments of $10,000 to $15,000 a month, according to the people familiar with the arrangement. All spoke on condition of anonymity because the arrangement is confidential.\nThe former official said that the crown prince’s father, King Salman, had ordered the payments shortly after he had first learned that Saudi agents had ambushed and killed Mr. Khashoggi, and that the payments were intended as a form of financial support, without conditions, that would continue indefinitely.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-khashoggi-children-payments.html"}
