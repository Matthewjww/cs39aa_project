But she said she qualified for an exemption because she was caring for her infirm mother and produced a form to make her case. Without a signature from her mother, the form was invalid and the officials turned her away. But she returned quickly, a little too quickly, with the document signed.\nThis time she claimed to have a sister who was vaccinated for the same reason, but a spot check of inoculation records showed that to be false as well.\n“She could not get out of here fast enough,” said Martin Helfrich, a spokesman for the city who witnessed the scene.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/world/europe/germany-vaccinated-line-jumpers.html"}
