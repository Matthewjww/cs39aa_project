But unlike those two rivals, Ms. Harris has not benefited from running in a campaign that soaked up national attention, which suggests she has barely begun to tap into her fund-raising potential, digital experts said.\nBullet Train to Nowhere : Construction of the California high-speed rail system, America’s most ambitious infrastructure project, Construction of the California high-speed rail system, America’s most ambitious infrastructure project, has become a multi-billion-dollar nightmare\nA Piece of Black History Destroyed: Lincoln Heights — a historically Black community in a predominantly white, rural county in Northern California — endured for decades. Lincoln Heights — a historically Black community in a predominantly white, rural county in Northern California — endured for decades. Then came the Mill fire\nWarehouse Moratorium: As warehouse construction balloons nationwide, residents in communities both rural and urban have pushed back. In California’s Inland Empire, As warehouse construction balloons nationwide, residents in communities both rural and urban have pushed back. In California’s Inland Empire, the anger has turned to widespread action\nMs. Harris’s first-day fund-raising figures were almost identical to what Mr. Sanders raised on his first day in 2015, when he made a splash as a favorite of grass-roots givers. Her campaign has said that her email list grew by 20 percent on that day alone. People close to the Sanders and O’Rourke campaigns view Ms. Harris as the candidate most likely to eventually compete with them for small donations.\nSome rivals have already witnessed her list’s force and reach.\nThe day of Ms. Klobuchar’s windfall, Ms. Harris had written an email seeking contributions for several female Democratic senators, including Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who is also running for president. The number of online donations Ms. Gillibrand received that day ranks as her fourth-most — one spot behind the day President Trump attacked her on Twitter — according to an analysis of election data from ActBlue, which processes Democratic donations online.\nFor Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also a 2020 candidate, her top two days in the last six years, in terms of number of online donations, coincided with days that Ms. Harris had asked her email list to support Ms. Warren financially. (One was after the now-infamous attempt to silence Ms. Warren on the Senate floor, when the Republican leader declared, “Nevertheless, she persisted.”)\n[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]\n“We couldn’t run a campaign of this magnitude without the consistent support of our incredible online supporters,” said Shelby Cole, who runs Ms. Harris’s email program and previously worked on Mr. O’Rourke’s Senate race. “Our supporters aren’t an ATM. This is a deep, lasting relationship we constantly seek to strengthen because their voices are central to our grass-roots campaign.”\nUnlike Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who have sworn off big-money fund-raisers, Ms. Harris has raced across the country to appear at events where donors give as much as $2,800 to attend; last week she held fund-raisers in Texas and California.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/us/politics/kamala-harris-fundraising.html"}
