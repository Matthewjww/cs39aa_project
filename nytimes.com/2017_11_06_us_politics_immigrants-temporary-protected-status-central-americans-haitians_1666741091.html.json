The department had until Monday to extend or terminate the program for Nicaragua and Honduras. Ms. Duke, saying she did not have enough information, said she would continue to review protections for Hondurans. The temporary protective status covering immigrants from Honduras will be extended for at least six months, through July 5.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/us/politics/immigrants-temporary-protected-status-central-americans-haitians.html"}
