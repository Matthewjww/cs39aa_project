Snapchat, based in Los Angeles, said in the filing that it began raising the latest round on Feb. 17, 2015.\nOver the last year, new investors, including General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and the hedge fund Lone Pine, have bought stakes in Snapchat, according to people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. Not long after Snapchat began to collect money, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba also agreed to invest $200 million at a valuation of $15 billion. Snapchat’s final valuation could not be learned.\nAs a private company, Snapchat is not required to disclose the identities of investors or its valuation. A representative for Snapchat declined to comment on the funding. The start-up’s previous investors include Fidelity Investments and Coatue. TechCrunch earlier reported some of the new investors.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/technology/snapchat-raises-1-8-billion-from-private-investors.html"}
