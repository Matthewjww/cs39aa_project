Mr. Grant, who was strapped to a gurney, convulsed and vomited as the first chemical, a sedative, was administered. After several minutes of this, members of the execution team wiped vomit from his face and neck.\nThe Oklahoma Department of Corrections said the execution was carried out in accordance with protocols and “without complication.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/us/politics/supreme-court-oklahoma-executions.html"}
