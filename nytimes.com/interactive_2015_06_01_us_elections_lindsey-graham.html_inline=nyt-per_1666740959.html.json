So there is a measure of why-not-me? to Mr. Graham’s candidacy that owes to his rising profile in Congress and success in navigating his own state’s conservative politics. Mr. Graham also sees an opportunity to put his mark on a party that is trying to find a way to win presidential elections when demography seems to be working against them. Success for Mr. Graham may ultimately be helping a Republican win the nomination and the presidency who can create a new coalition for the party and strike the sort of deals he has been pursuing during his 12 years in the Senate.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/01/us/elections/lindsey-graham.html?inline=nyt-per"}
