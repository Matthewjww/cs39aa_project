Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times\nPresident Trump, eager to prove he is healthy and energetic despite his recent hospitalization for Covid-19, returned to the campaign trail on Monday night in Florida, speaking for just over an hour in a state his advisers think he must win in November, but where voters were overwhelmingly repelled by his performance at the first general election debate.\nOnstage at a hangar at the Orlando Sanford International Airport, Mr. Trump, whose voice sounded hoarse and strained as he began, claimed he was fully recovered and therefore immune to the coronavirus — a claim for which there is no conclusive scientific backing.\n“I feel so powerful,” said Mr. Trump, who did not wear a mask while boarding Air Force One. “I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women. Just give you a big fat kiss.”\nMr. Trump, whose response to a pandemic that has killed more than 214,000 Americans remains the biggest threat to his re-election, claimed without any evidence that his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., would delay the vaccine and “prolong the pandemic.” He made fun of the small and socially distanced campaign events that Mr. Biden has been hosting, and commended his own campaign for the massive crowds it has been turning out at rallies, calling them “the real polls.”\nMr. Trump’s arrival in Florida took place only hours after the White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley, said the president had tested negative “on consecutive days” using a rapid antigen coronavirus test not intended for that purpose. Experts cautioned that the test’s accuracy has not yet been investigated enough to be sure that the president is virus-free or, as his doctor claimed, “not infectious to others.”\nMany supporters in the crowd did not wear masks, including some of those chosen to stand behind the president’s podium, and within the television camera shot.\nOnstage, Mr. Trump also made fun of questions about whether he would agree to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses. He claimed, falsely, that President Barack Obama spied on his 2016 campaign and noted, “We’ll take care of it after the election,” adding, “gives you another reason to go out and vote.”\nFor the most part, however, the president was back to delivering his regular, factually challenged campaign stump speech, in which he brags about killing terrorists and building a wall along the southern border, and accuses the news media of being “frauds.” On Monday night, he boasted about being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, even though the prize this year went to the U.N. World Food Program, and blamed the media for not giving him enough credit for a nomination when news outlets had covered Mr. Obama being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009.\n“I turned on the fake news, story after story, they talk about your weather in the panhandle,” he said, referring to hurricane coverage.\nSupporters and critics of the president were likely to focus as much on how the president looked and sounded at the rally as on anything he said. The question of whether he will be healthy enough to regularly make it through a full Trumpian performance — usually at least 90 minutes — without flagging is one that will hover over him until the election on Nov. 3. On Monday night, he appeared virtually back to himself despite a scratchy sounding voice, clocking in at 65 minutes.\nOn Saturday at the White House, in his first public appearance since returning from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Mr. Trump spoke for only 18 minutes, uncharacteristically cutting an appearance short. His aides had said he would speak for 30 minutes. But top campaign officials said on Monday that they had no concerns about his energy or overall health, only enthusiasm that the candidate was ready to return to the campaign trail.\n“This morning, in our morning conversation, he was getting on my case for not having enough rallies,” said Jason Miller, the Trump campaign’s senior strategist. Mr. Miller said the president’s schedule would include “two to three events a day, and that will grow as we get closer to Election Day.”\nThe frenetic pace serves as a reminder that with three weeks left in the race, Mr. Trump is running behind Mr. Biden. His polling numbers with seniors, a crucial constituency that has been disproportionately harmed by the coronavirus, have been flagging.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/12/us/trump-vs-biden"}
