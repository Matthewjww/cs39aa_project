Andrew M. Cuomo gave districts permission to do so.\nMr. Cuomo announced Friday that public school districts across the state could hold in-person classes this fall, even as districts in many parts of the country where cases are still rising have abandoned the idea and will continue with remote learning.\nIn interviews, doctors, epidemiologists and other public health experts said that conditions were favorable throughout the state, including New York City, to bring children back â€” as long as safety precautions are in place. Some expressed concern that the effects of keeping students home were more worrisome.\nAs of Wednesday, fewer than 1 percent of coronavirus tests statewide were positive, well below the 5 percent positivity threshold that both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have targeted as a safe standard for reopening schools.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/health/coronavirus-ny-schools-reopen.html"}
