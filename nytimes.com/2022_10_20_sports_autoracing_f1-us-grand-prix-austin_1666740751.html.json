Next year, there will be a race in Las Vegas along the Strip on a Saturday night.\nBoth cities have the kind of global appeal that Formula 1 hopes will cement its place as a fixture in the American sporting calendar, cracking a market where the sport had long struggled.\nYet without the United States Grand Prix, which has been held at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, since 2012, the additional American races may not have happened. Helped by the success of the “Drive to Survive” series on Netflix, strong Austin attendance proved there were enough fans in the United States to justify more than one race there.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/20/sports/autoracing/f1-us-grand-prix-austin.html"}
