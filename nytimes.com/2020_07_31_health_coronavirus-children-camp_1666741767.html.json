The virus blazed through the community of about 600 campers and counselors, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday.\nThe staff and counselors gathered at the overnight camp in late June. Within a week of the camp orientation, a teenage counselor developed chills and went home.\nThe camp, which the C.D.C. did not name, started sending campers home the next day, and shut down a few days later. By then, 76 percent of the 344 campers and staffers whose test results were available to C.D.C. researchers had been infected with the virus â€” nearly half the camp.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/coronavirus-children-camp.html"}
