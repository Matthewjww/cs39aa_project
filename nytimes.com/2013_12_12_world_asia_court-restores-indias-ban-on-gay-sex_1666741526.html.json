But the Supreme Court held that only Parliament had the power to change that law.\nThere is almost no chance that Parliament will act where the Supreme Court did not, advocates and opponents of the law agreed. With the Bharatiya Janata Party, a conservative Hindu nationalist group, appearing in ascendancy before national elections in the spring, the prospect of any legislative change in the next few years is highly unlikely, analysts said.\nAnjali Gopalan, founder of a charity that sued to overturn the 1861 law, said she was shocked by the ruling.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/world/asia/court-restores-indias-ban-on-gay-sex.html"}
