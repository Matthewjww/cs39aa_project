His sentencing came a month and a half after North Korea sentenced an American college student, Otto F. Warmbier, to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal a political banner from his hotel in Pyongyang.\nMr. Kim’s sentence was handed down by North Korea’s Supreme Court, meaning that it is final and cannot be appealed. The verdict was reported by China’s state-run Xinhua news agency and the Japanese news service Kyodo.\nThe State Department has not explicitly confirmed Mr. Kim’s detention in North Korea, saying that discussing such cases publicly does not help its efforts to free Americans held in the North. But the North has released a copy of Mr. Kim’s American passport, and officials in South Korea said Mr. Kim was a Korean-born American citizen.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/world/asia/north-korea-kim-dong-chul-sentence.html"}
