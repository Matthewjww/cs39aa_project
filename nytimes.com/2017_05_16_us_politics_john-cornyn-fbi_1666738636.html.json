I’ve informed the administration that I’m committed to helping them find such an individual, and that the best way I can serve is continuing to fight for a conservative agenda in the U.S. Senate.”\nAnother congressional Republican, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, has also said he does not want to be considered for the job, which became open when President Trump fired James B.
