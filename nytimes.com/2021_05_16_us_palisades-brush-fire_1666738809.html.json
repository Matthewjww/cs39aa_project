It had burned 750 acres in western Los Angeles County and was at zero percent containment on Saturday evening, the Fire Department said. By Sunday, the fire had spread to 1,325 acres and was still at zero percent containment, the department said.\nEvacuation orders in three areas remained in place early Monday.\nThe cause of the fire was “deemed to be a ‘suspicious start’ and it remains an open, active investigation,” the department said.
