The payment, for “consulting,’’ apparently was intended to bring Mr. Mastriano a broader following on Gab, which is known as a haven for white nationalists and users banned from other platforms.\nIn defending Mr. Mastriano’s ties to Gab in recent days, its founder, Andrew Torba, repeatedly made antisemitic remarks and said in one video that neither he nor Mr. Mastriano would give interviews to non-Christian journalists.\nMr. Mastriano on Thursday did not condemn Mr. Torba. He blamed Democrats and “the media” for the controversy.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/28/us/politics/doug-mastriano-gab.html"}
