He was not even in the field until another horse was scratched the day before the race.\nBut after initially pointing the colt toward the Preakness Stakes on Saturday, Rich Strike’s owner said last week the horse would skip the Preakness and run in the Belmont Stakes on June 11 instead. There won’t be a Triple Crown on the line, but there is sure to be plenty of drama, with the filly Secret Oath, winner of the Kentucky Oaks, taking on the boys, including the Derby runner-up, Epicenter.\nBelow, the Preakness horses are listed in order of post position, with comments by Joe Drape and Melissa Hoppert of The New York Times. The morning-line odds were set by Keith Feustle of Pimlico Race Course.\nHow to watch: Coverage on Saturday begins on CNBC at 2 p.m. Eastern time and moves to NBC at 4 p.m. Coverage will also be streamed on NBCSports.com.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/19/sports/horse-racing/preakness-stakes-picks-odds-predictions.html"}
