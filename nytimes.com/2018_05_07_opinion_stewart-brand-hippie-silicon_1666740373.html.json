I want to focus less on the impact of his work, which is all around us, and more on how he did it, because he’s a model of how you do social change.\nStewart Brand was born in Rockford, Ill., in 1938, the son of an advertising executive. By the early 1960s, he felt alienated from boring, bourgeois suburbia and concluded that Native Americans had a lot to teach the rest of us about how to lead a more authentic way of life.\nIn 1965, he created a multimedia presentation called “America Needs Indians,” which he performed at the LSD-laced, proto-hippie gatherings he helped organize in California.\nBrand then had two epiphanies. First, there were no public photos of the entire earth. Second, if people like him were going to return to the land and lead natural lives, they would need tools.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/opinion/stewart-brand-hippie-silicon.html"}
