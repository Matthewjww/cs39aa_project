Officials in South Korea and Japan said that while the situation was tense, it had not reached a crisis point.\nSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson played down any imminent threat from North Korea, saying Wednesday, “I think Americans should sleep well at night, have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/world/asia/north-korea-trump-threat-fire-and-fury.html"}
