Terrified for his three daughters, he crammed his family into a car the next morning and barreled down winding dirt roads into Pakistan.\nThat was more than 20 years ago. They returned to Kabul, the capital, nearly a decade later after the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban regime. But now, with the Taliban sweeping across parts of the country as American forces withdraw, Mr. Sakhi, 68, fears a return of the violence he witnessed that night. This time, he says, his family is not waiting so long to leave.\n“I’m not scared of leaving belongings behind, I’m not scared of starting everything from scratch,” said Mr. Sakhi, who recently applied for Turkish visas for himself, his wife, their three daughters and one son. “What I’m scared of is the Taliban.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/world/asia/afghanistan-migration-taliban.html"}
