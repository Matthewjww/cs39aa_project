As the film progresses, though, it becomes clear that these particular humans might not be worth saving.\nAs written by Jeunet and Guillaume Laurant, “Bigbug,” filmed on a single stage set, delivers artificial-intelligence comedy with a doomy vibe. When a militaristic breed of androids, the Yonyx, attempts a political takeover, the bickering, blended family — chiefly a ditsy wife (Elsa Zylberstein), her randy suitor (Stéphane De Groodt), her boorish ex-husband (Youssef Hadji) and his younger-model fiancée (Claire Chust) — finds itself trapped in unwilling lockdown by its mechanical servants.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/movies/big-bug-review.html"}
