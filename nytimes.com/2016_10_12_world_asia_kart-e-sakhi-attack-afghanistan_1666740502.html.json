Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry who announced that the operation was over, said one assailant had been killed. Earlier in the evening, Mr. Sediqqi had said that three attackers were involved, one of them shot by police officers and the other two holed up inside the shrine.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/asia/kart-e-sakhi-attack-afghanistan.html"}
