Winners receive a diploma and a medal, and each prize is also awarded 10 million Swedish krona, or about $900,000, which is divided if there are multiple winners.\nDuring the pandemic, the Nobels made adjustments. In 2020 and 2021, some events were canceled in favor of a digital ceremony for the winners, and the Oslo ceremony for the peace prize was smaller than in most years, with a limited audience. This year, laureates will receive their Nobel Prize medals and diplomas in Stockholm in December, the organization said, and winners from the previous two years will also be invited.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/article/nobel-prizes-2022.html"}
