State and federal officials said the need was high in places all around the country and there is only a limited pot of funds overall.\nBut without more aid, tens of thousands of renters who lost their jobs in the pandemic will not be able to cover their debts and could be at greater risk of eviction when a moratorium expires in less than two weeks. Landlords also will not be able to make up the lost rental income.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/nyregion/new-york-rent-relief-pandemic.html"}
