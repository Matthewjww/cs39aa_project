Chris Christie of New Jersey put a final stop on Wednesday to the most expensive public-works project in the country: a proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River that could have doubled commuter-train service to Manhattan.\nMr. Christie, who had already withdrawn his support for the project once a few weeks ago, said his decision to scrap it would not be reconsidered.\nHe said that the state’s share of the costs of building the tunnel had risen to at least $3.5 billion and that, after weeks of proposing other financing methods, federal officials had not relieved New Jersey of the burden of future overruns.\n“What proponents are asking me to do is hand over a blank check,” Mr. Christie, a Republican, said in Trenton. “I simply will not do that.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/nyregion/28tunnel.html"}
