Mr. Biden predicted that the national death toll from Covid-19 would top 500,000 next month, refusing to play down the carnage that his predecessor was loath to acknowledge.\nThe mask requirement for public transportation, coupled with the order Mr. Biden issued on Wednesday requiring mask-wearing in all federal facilities, edges the country toward the kind of comprehensive mask mandate that has dominated debate at the state and local level between public health advocates and those defending what they called individual liberty.\nMr. Biden described his approach as a “full-scale wartime effort,” but his chief medical adviser for the coronavirus, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, made it clear how difficult the task would be. Appearing in the White House briefing room for the first time since November, Dr. Fauci said powerful treatments using manufactured antibodies, which were used on President Donald J. Trump, were not effective against more infectious variants of the virus circulating in South Africa and Brazil, which have not yet emerged in the United States.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/us/politics/biden-coronavirus-response.html"}
