She expected an answer in 24 to 48 hours. The test was not only swift, it was free.\n“I think it is super,” Ms. Kirstein said. “It was so easy to find, and best of all, it didn’t cost me a thing.”\nAs of Saturday, Germany will require that same simple test for all citizens or residents, like Ms. Kirstein, and other travelers who enter the country from coronavirus “hot spots,” again making it a leader in using testing as a firewall against the spread of the virus.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-test-travelers.html"}
