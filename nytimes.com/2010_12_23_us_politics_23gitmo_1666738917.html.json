It is considered highly unlikely that Mr. Obama will veto the bill because it also authorizes billions in spending for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nRobert M. Chesney, a University of Texas law professor who specializes in national security matters, said the legislation would make it even harder to close the prison, at the American military base in Cuba. He said the next Congress, in which Republicans will have more power, was likely to keep or even intensify the restrictions.\n“A Democratic Congress has done its level best to prevent prosecutions in civilian court,” Professor Chesney said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/us/politics/23gitmo.html"}
