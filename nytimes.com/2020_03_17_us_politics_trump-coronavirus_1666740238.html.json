On Tuesday he took to the White House lectern and made a remarkable assertion: He knew it was a pandemic all along.\n“This is a pandemic,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.”\nThis is what Mr. Trump has actually said over the past two months:\nOn Jan. 22, asked by a CNBC reporter whether there were “worries about a pandemic,” the president replied: “No, not at all. We have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.”\nOn Feb. 26, at a White House news conference, commenting on the country’s first reported cases: “We’re going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we’ve had very good luck.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html"}
