A random sample is taken from a pool of all possible telephone numbers, whether listed or not. But if a person has two phone numbers, he or she has a higher chance of being contacted for a survey, so their responses are weighted to adjust for that.\nPollsters are confident they can interview about 1,000 people to measure the views of a nation of over 300 million. With a larger sample, the accuracy of the poll, as measured by the margin of sampling error, increases. With 1,000 people, that margin is plus or minus 3 percentage points.\nBut doubling the number polled, which considerably increases the cost, shrinks the sampling error to only plus or minus 2 percentage points. A larger sample allows for better analysis of subgroups, but otherwise pollsters donâ€™t get that much more bang for the buck by increasing the sample over 1,000.\nAsk a Pollster addresses questions about the hows and whys of polling.
