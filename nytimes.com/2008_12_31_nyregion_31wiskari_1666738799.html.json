He was 90.\nMr. Wiskari’s death was confirmed by his wife, Millie Wiskari.\nThe son of a Finnish-born Lutheran pastor in upper Michigan, he served with the Navy in the Pacific in World War II and joined The Times as a radio news scriptwriter in 1948, soon after graduating from Columbia and doing a year of postgraduate study there.\nFrom 1958 to 1964 he was based in Stockholm as the northern European correspondent for The Times, its last. His articles covered the annual Nobel Prize awards, there and in Oslo, the difficulties Sweden and Finland had with staying politically neutral in the shadow of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and oddities of Nordic life.\nHe became an assistant to the foreign news editor of The Times in 1968 but kept up with developments in Scandinavia and Finland. In 1971, he was part of the small team of editors that prepared the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department’s secret history of the Vietnam War, for publication.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/nyregion/31wiskari.html"}
