The site, which started three years ago, was never supposed to exist. Today, thousands of players are broadcasting, or streaming, their games on the site at any given moment, with many amassing a loyal audience.\nTwitch’s peak viewership now rivals the average prime-time viewers of some cable networks, as seen in the chart above. But compared with online video giants, Twitch is small. In hours of video viewed each month, Netflix is roughly eight times larger than Twitch, and YouTube is roughly 24 times larger, according to statistics from each company.\nStill, top Twitch streamers build large audiences, and hold the attention of tens of thousands of people for hours, as seen in the charts below.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/26/technology/charting-the-rise-of-twitch.html"}
