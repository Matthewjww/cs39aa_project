Because otherwise they’ll be disenfranchised.” Republicans filed a lawsuit late Tuesday objecting to any attempts to correct naked ballots. “It is my understanding that it is not permitted, based on a ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and I’ll leave that up to the lawyers who are in court fighting about that to determine what to do about it.” But this is just one of the many legal battles over mail ballots. “As the election starts moving over to the mail system, new things start becoming issues and all these things become cause for really hard-fought court cases.” Ballots are still being counted the day after the election in Lancaster. “So what you’re seeing right now are racks of mail ballots that had been received Monday and Tuesday and are going to be opened here today and then scanned in.” More are expected between now and Friday: ballots postmarked by Election Day but delivered late by the United States Postal Service. What isn’t clear yet is whether they’ll be counted. “The law says that they basically won’t be counted, if they came in by 8 o’clock. But the PA Supreme Court says as long as they’re postmarked or even if there’s not a postmark, then they should be counted. That was challenged to the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court said that it’s a little late right now, we’re not going to expedite that decision on that, but we will make a decision after the election. So we’re just sticking those mail ballots aside. And so either the U.S. Supreme Court makes a decision, or we can actually then go ahead and scan them.” “That sounds very confusing.” “Yes. Hello.” Not all of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties are handling the uncertainty the same way. In Lehigh County, they’re taking the time to scan the ballots and keeping a separate tally until the lawsuits are resolved. “We will be receiving ballots all week long. And we time-stamp them when we receive them to make sure we know exactly when they were received by our office.” The confusion has put Pennsylvania in the spotlight in a way that has some officials feeling déjà vu. “You can see the potential for Pennsylvania to be like Florida in 2000, where the eyes of the nation are on us. We don’t have the hanging chad issue. But we have the issue of ballots coming in for three days after the election. We have the issue of naked ballots. I was worried about what would happen. And maybe some of that is coming true. We’ll see as we get further into this.” “I just want to get you to kind of clarify your explanation to the prior question.” “I could use all the help I can get.” “Did anybody ask questions about the segregation of ballots in the small conference room yet?” “They’re just ones that came in after after Saturday.” “Are you waiting for any further instructions to begin counting any ballots received after Tuesday, or are you going to count, scan them, tabulate them until you receive an order that tells you that you can’t?” “Yes. Yes.” “OK, and then any ballots you receive —” “Those ballots are actually down in the office.” “So we should have a final certified result from Lehigh County, absent any court order messing that up, by the 23rd? Gotcha. Thank you very much.” “Court cases after Election Day, I can’t remember anything that would have an effect on the outcome. It’s very different than other years.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/us/politics/pennsylvania-results-trump-biden.html"}
