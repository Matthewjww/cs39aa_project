But attempts to repeal it failed, as did two earlier Supreme Court challenges, in 2012 and 2015. With the passing years, the law has gained in popularity and been woven into the fabric of the health care system in ways big and small.\nPresident-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. vowed Tuesday to preserve and expand the law when he takes office on Jan. 20, and he assailed the arguments made in court by lawyers for Republican officials and the Trump administration.\nMr. Biden lashed out at what he called “far-right ideologues” in the administration who had asked the court to strike down the law, saying the impact of such a move for millions of Americans would be severe.\nCampaigning for president, Mr. Biden said he wanted to strengthen the law by offering a public option that allows people to receive coverage the way Medicare enrollees do, through a system of government-run insurance. People who would prefer to stay on private insurance would be able to do so.\nThe new case, California v. Texas, No. 19-840, was brought by Republican officials who said the mandate requiring insurance became unconstitutional after Congress in 2017 eliminated the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance because it could no longer be justified as a tax.\nThey went on to argue that the mandate was a crucial feature of the law, and so the entire law should be thrown out.\nThe challenge has largely succeeded in the lower courts. A federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was invalid, but he postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but declined to rule on the fate of the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/supreme-court-obamacare-aca.html"}
