But their team cannot be known as “Russia,” the Russian flag is banned and so is its anthem. Instead, the team was introduced as “Russian Olympic Committee.”\nA good number of Russian athletes emerged 77th in the parade of nations, looking like any other country. Their flag included the Olympic rings, but also red, white and blue waves, not coincidentally the colors in Russia’s flag.\nWithout any fans present, there was no way to gauge the response of Olympic lovers to the team from any cheers or boos.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/23/sports/olympics/roc-russia-olympics.html"}
