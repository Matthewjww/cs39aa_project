Milan — JPMorgan had come under intense criticism from fans and others merely for participating in the plan.\nDesigned as a 20-team league with 15 permanent members, the Super League would have severely cut in to the revenues of dozens of national leagues, imperiled the finances and values of the hundreds of European clubs who were left out, and upended the structures that have underpinned European soccer for a century — all while funneling billions to a few elite teams.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/sports/soccer/jpmorgan-super-league.html"}
