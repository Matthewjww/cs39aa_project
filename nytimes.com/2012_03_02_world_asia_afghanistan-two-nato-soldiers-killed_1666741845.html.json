Four other Americans were wounded in the attack, which began around 2:30 a.m. local time.\nThe two men who mounted the assault fled afterward, but American forces called helicopters to pursue them. Masoom Khan, the district chief of police, said that the two were killed by helicopter gunfire more than a mile from the scene of the attack.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/world/asia/afghanistan-two-nato-soldiers-killed.html"}
