But natural gas — which is a crucial power source when electricity usage peaks — was hit hardest.\n“All sources underperformed expectations,” said Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston. “But far, far more than everything else combined were the shortfalls from natural gas.”\nDuring the blackouts, the grid lost roughly five times as much power from natural gas as it did from wind. Natural gas production froze, and so did the pipelines that transport the gas. Once power plants went offline, they were not prepared to restart in the below-freezing conditions.\nDemand for natural gas to heat homes and businesses also spiked, contributing to shortages. And high gas prices further disrupted generation, as operators who could not turn a profit took their plants offline.\nSeveral coal plants and one of Texas’ four nuclear facilities were also knocked offline by cold temperatures.\nThe usually-balmy state does not require power plants to be winterized — “as we've painfully come to find out,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at The University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute.\nJust as generation was dropping from the grid, demand for electricity in Texas hit a record high for winter, rivaling demand seen during some of the hottest summer days. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the majority of the state’s power grid, reported that demand peaked at 69,000 megawatts on Sunday, surpassing its planned worst-case scenario.\nShortly after, the grid operator instructed utilities to begin controlled power outages to avoid longer-term damage.\nHow Power Generation Compared to Worst-Case Plans This was ERCOT’s worst-case plan for peak demand and extreme outages. 61,388 MW Natural gas, coal, nuclear and hydroelectric power Wind On the evening of Feb. 14, power generation briefly surpassed ERCOT’s worst-case estimate. 67,970 MW But power generation dipped much lower from Feb. 14 through 17. 46,059 MW Solar power This was ERCOT’s worst-case plan for peak demand and extreme outages. Wind Natural gas, coal, nuclear and hydro On the evening of Feb. 14, power generation briefly surpassed ERCOT’s worst-case estimate. But power generation dipped much lower from Feb. 14 through 17.

It does not include auxiliary and backup power supplies used during peak demand.\nIn its seasonal risk assessment, ERCOT anticipated that “extreme” winter demand could spike as high as 67,000 megawatts statewide if conditions matched the 2011 ice storm that led to blackouts in parts of the state. Researchers estimate that had the grid been able to deliver it, power needed for heating would have pushed demand around 5,000 megawatts higher earlier this week.\nGovernor Greg Abbott blamed the blackouts on solar and wind energy, but those power sources were not major players in the state’s emergency plans.\nDr. Cohan said the state's emergency scenario wasn't so far off in some of its predictions, but it failed to anticipate the scale of outages caused by this winter storm, particularly among natural gas power plants.\n“None of their scenarios envisioned that we could possibly have over 30,000 megawatts of outages at the same time,” he said. “That’s more than double their worst-case.”\nExperts are still assembling a full picture of what contributed to the power failures and lawmakers have called for an investigation into ERCOT’s preparedness and handling of the situation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/19/climate/texas-storm-power-generation-charts.html"}
