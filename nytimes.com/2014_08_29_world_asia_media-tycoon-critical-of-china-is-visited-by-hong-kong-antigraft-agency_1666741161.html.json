The office and the apartment of Lee Cheuk-yan, a legislator who received donations from Mr. Lai, were also searched Thursday morning.\nA person who identified himself as a shareholder of Mr. Lai’s media group, Next Media, sent a trove of leaked documents to Hong Kong newspapers last month, including images of banking receipts. They indicated that several pro-democracy groups and individuals received more than $1.3 million in donations last year through Mr. Simon. Lawmakers from a pro-Beijing party later filed reports to the legislature and the anticorruption agency calling for a formal investigation of the matter.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/29/world/asia/media-tycoon-critical-of-china-is-visited-by-hong-kong-antigraft-agency.html"}
