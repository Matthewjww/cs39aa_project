The president also ignored a question from another reporter who asked how a better economy would have protected Mr. Floyd.\nInstead, Mr. Trump trained his focus on the need to reopen the country and on the jobs report as evidence of what moving past the coronavirus and reopening would do. It would be like a hurricane that “goes away, and within two hours, everyone is rebuilding and fixing and cleaning and cutting their grass.”\nThe president said Americans should “do social distancing, and you wear masks if you want,” but he made clear he was happy to leave the pandemic behind. Health experts, including those in the Trump administration, have warned that the United States is not in the clear. Officials are still confirming more than 20,000 new cases a day as testing expands and new hot spots appear.\n“Even you,” Mr. Trump said to reporters assembled there, “I notice you’re starting to get much closer together, looks much better, not all the way there yet but you’ll be there soon.”\nThe White House Correspondents’ Association said later that White House officials violated federal social distancing guidelines by moving chairs in the Rose Garden closer together before the event.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/us/politics/trump-jobs-report-george-floyd.html"}
