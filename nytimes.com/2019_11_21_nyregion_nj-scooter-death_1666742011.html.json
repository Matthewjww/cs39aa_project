Christian Bollwage.\nThe mayor said a large tow truck was making a right turn from Elizabeth Avenue onto Spring Street at about 8:05 p.m. when it struck the boy, a local resident, who died shortly after the collision. The driver, who stayed at the scene and called for help, has not been charged, a city official said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/nyregion/nj-scooter-death.html"}
