Trump’s Cessna flew to Montreal on May 4, it certainly was not for a campaign event. Instead, the quick Montreal trip was a bureaucratic barrel roll, evading a monthlong wait — effectively cutting a line of other airplane owners — to be allowed to fly the plane again.\nThe plane had been grounded in April by the Federal Aviation Administration for having an expired registration, forcing Mr. Trump to use his much larger Boeing 757 during one of the final weeks of the Republican nominating fight.\nMr. Trump’s Cessna Citation X landed a little after 11 a.m. at Trudeau airport in Montreal on May 4. Less than 20 minutes later, according to air traffic control communications, the plane was preparing to take off again. And less than 20 minutes after that, it was in the air, headed back to Connecticut.\nThe trip to Montreal followed a slew of paperwork that was filed April 22. That day, the plane was sold by a Trump-controlled company to another, DT Endeavor I LLC, which promptly registered its newly acquired airplane with the government.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/21/us/politics/trump-plane-license-montreal.html"}
