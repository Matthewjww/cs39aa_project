He also said that the numbers allowed at social gatherings were to be cut and that the penalties for breaking the limits or for not wearing masks were to be doubled. Mr. Johnson said that the restrictions could last for six months.\nMr. Starmer said that forcing the country into a second national lockdown would be a reflection of Mr. Johnson’s failure to lead.\n“The prime minister has had months to prepare for this, but instead of getting a grip, the government has lost control,” he said.\nMr. Johnson’s Conservative Party won a landslide victory in the December vote, a result that paved the way for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/world/europe/uk-labour-keir-starmer.html"}
