On Election Day evening, the differences seemed even more potent.\nAt the Union Rescue Mission, a five-story building that houses close to 1,100 people struggling to stay off the streets and out of the tent encampments, the cafeteria was turned into a polling place.\nVoters — firefighters from the nearby station, homeless outreach workers, residents of the Mission, the homeless themselves — trickled in, but there was never much of a line.\nClose by, a line of people snaked far down the street and around the corner, as voters waited, some for more than two hours, to vote at the Ace Hotel. At the bar, happy hour customers were eating oysters.\nJennifer Van Leigh, 36, first went to the Ace, saw the line, and was one of the few to realize that there were other options. “I figured this place would have no line,” she said, at the Mission. “Because no one wants to come to Skid Row.”\nAt the Mission, voting was the last thing on the mind of Eduardo Duran, who was waving a flyer with a photo of his nephew Miguel, a crystal meth addict who has been missing since mid-February.\nNo one had seen him, and he was told to stick the flyer on the wall, next to several other notices of missing people. “He’s not homeless, but he chooses to be on the streets,” said Mr. Duran. “We went to all the hospitals, police, the parks.”\nAndy Bales, the chief executive officer of the Mission, had just sent an email to his staff, asking them “to spread the word to all of our guests to vote.”\n“Share your voice, be part of it,” is what he likes to say to the people living at the Mission.\nThe homeless crisis here disproportionately affects black men, and many of the voters at the Mission said they were voting for Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose candidacy has focused on African-Americans. “I’m most familiar with Joe Biden,” said Patrick Wright, 50, who is African-American and recently got out of prison. He is living at the Mission while he tries to get his life back on track.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/super-tuesday-03-03?action=click&module=ELEX_results&pgtype=Interactive&region=ReporterUpdates"}
