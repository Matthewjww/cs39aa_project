He has repeatedly described the Senate hearings as a kangaroo court.\n\"This is not a good day for Brazil,\" said Ney Maranhao, a Senator from Mr. Collor's National Reconstruction Party. \"It is a coup d'etat.\"\nMaria Teresa Teixeira, a spokeswoman for Mr. Collor, told reporters outside his lavish home in Brasilia that he had received 800 telegrams of support on Monday but had resigned because \"he did not have a chance to defend himself and would lose eight years of his political rights if he did not resign.\"\nShe added, \"He is emotional, as you would expect.\" 'He Is Suffering,' Aide Says\nAnother Collor aide, Etevaldo Dias, said Mr. Collor made the decision to resign at 7:45 this morning. \"He has been hit and he is suffering,\" Mr. Dias said.\nThere was speculation that Mr. Collor would soon leave for Paris, where he has an apartment valued at $1.7 million.\n\"This is a landmark event,\" said Loise Retzek, a Government worker who was standing with her small son outside the Congress building today. She said that until now corrupt Government officials had always enjoyed impunity. \"Now we have hope that people can express their voices and be heard,\" she said.\nShe added that the resignation was a victory for the young people who clamored against Mr. Collor. \"They went to the streets, they called for the impeachment and they won,\" she said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/30/world/brazilian-leader-quits-as-his-trial-starts-in-senate.html"}
