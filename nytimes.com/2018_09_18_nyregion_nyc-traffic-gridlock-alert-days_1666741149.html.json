It took an average of 19 minutes to drive just one mile in Midtown Manhattan on a Monday during the United Nations session last year, up from an average of 10 minutes the rest of the year, according to city data. The only time it took longer — 20 minutes — was in a blizzard in March. By comparison, the mile-long drive took 14 minutes the day of the Rockefeller Center tree lighting.\n“U.N. week is the most challenging traffic time in New York City and I’m not even sure people know that,” said Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner. “If you are in the traffic, you are the traffic.”\nBeginning this week, the city will spend $500,000 on a new campaign to warn of gridlock days on the radio and in internet ads to try to get more drivers off the road on the six weekdays from Sept. 24 through Oct. 1, the busiest stretch of the United Nations session, and at the end-of-the-year holidays.\nThe message to drivers? “Your trip through Midtown will take three times as long.”\nIn the past, when gridlock days started in November on the Friday before Thanksgiving and ran to Christmas, the city publicized them with news releases, social media and articles that often appeared on the gridlock day itself. City transportation officials said that after surveying drivers online, they learned that some drivers did not have enough time to change their plans.\nSo this year, the paid ads will begin a week in advance of the gridlock days.\nIf these gridlock warnings are not scary enough, they will be accompanied by new incentives to try other ways of getting around: a half-priced, three-day pass for Citi Bike; discounts on shared car pool rides with Via; and $5 flat-rate parking at Citi Field before noon in lots that are adjacent to the No. 7 subway line.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/nyregion/nyc-traffic-gridlock-alert-days.html"}
