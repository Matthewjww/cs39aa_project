A few were willing to openly contradict him.\nGov. Mike DeWine of Ohio said that it was time to call Joseph R. Biden Jr. the “president-elect.” The Republican attorney general of Arizona said that Mr. Trump would not end up winning his state, despite the president’s protestations. And on Capitol Hill, several Republican senators have begun, in measured tones, to say that Mr. Biden should be entitled to classified intelligence briefings as the incoming commander in chief or that it is time to recognize he will soon be certified as president-elect.\nAsked when he believed Mr. Trump should accept the result, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, even set a deadline for the president to acknowledge reality: Dec. 13 — the day before the Electoral College delegations cast their votes for president.\nInfluential party financiers and strategists have begun to weigh in, as well.\n“The president does a disservice to his more rabid supporters by insisting that he would have won the Nov. 3 election absent voter fraud,” said an editorial in The Las Vegas Review-Journal, a newspaper owned by the family of the Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson. “That’s simply false.” Mr. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, have given more than $75 million to super PACs supporting Mr. Trump.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/us/politics/trump-republican-party-election.html"}
