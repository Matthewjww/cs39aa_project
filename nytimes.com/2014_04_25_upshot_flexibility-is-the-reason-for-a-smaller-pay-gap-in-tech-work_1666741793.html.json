So it is surprising that in the tech sector, the pay gap between women and men is one of the smallest.\nFemale computer scientists make 89 percent of what men in the same occupation make, controlling for age, race, hours and education, according to data from Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University labor economist and expert on women and the economy. For engineering managers, pay is just about equal for men and women.\nThose numbers are significantly better than in other professions, including finance (66 percent), medicine (71 percent) and law (82 percent).", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/upshot/flexibility-is-the-reason-for-a-smaller-pay-gap-in-tech-work.html"}
