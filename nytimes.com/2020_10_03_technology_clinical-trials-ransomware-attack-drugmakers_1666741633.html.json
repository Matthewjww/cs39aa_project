ERT said clinical trial patients were never at risk, but customers said the attack forced trial researchers to track their patients with pen and paper.\nAmong those hit were IQVIA, the contract research organization helping manage AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine trial, and Bristol Myers Squibb, the drugmaker leading a consortium of companies to develop a quick test for the virus.\nERT has not said how many clinical trials were affected, but its software is used in drug trials across Europe, Asia and North America. It was used in three-quarters of trials that led to drug approvals by the Food and Drug Administration last year, according to its website.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/technology/clinical-trials-ransomware-attack-drugmakers.html"}
