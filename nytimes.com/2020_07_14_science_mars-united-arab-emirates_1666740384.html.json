But now, the U.A.E. is aiming to inspire its youth to pursue science and technology careers, and Ms. al-Amiri has forged a career pursuing the heavens.\nJust 33 years old, she is the head of science operations and the deputy project manager for a space probe that the U.A.E. is about to send to Mars.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/science/mars-united-arab-emirates.html"}
