That year a physicist and historian of science, Thomas S. Kuhn, did for conceptions of science what Copernicus and Einstein did for astronomy and physics. He led a revolution, at least if one accepts the analysis in his book, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,'' which has sold over a million copies in 20 languages.\nKuhn introduced the now common notion of paradigm as an accepted set of principles by which the world is viewed. When a paradigm shifts, when, for example, the earth is no longer seen as the center of the universe, old notions of truth are discarded and new ones take their place.\nBut that wasn't all Kuhn said. He argued that new paradigms are no more valid than the old; they just turn out to be more useful. Kuhn dismissed the idea of scientific progress, portraying scientists as a self-regulated guild that excommunicates dissenters and is preoccupied with what he dismissively referred to as puzzle-solving.\nThe implications of these ideas turned out to be far more controversial than Kuhn initially imagined, and five years after his death the debate over his intellectual revolution continues.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/21/books/coming-to-blows-over-how-valid-science-really-is.html"}
