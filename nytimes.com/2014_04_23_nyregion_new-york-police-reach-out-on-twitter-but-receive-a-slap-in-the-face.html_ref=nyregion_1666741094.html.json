And judging by the output on Tuesday, there are quite a few.\nOfficers holding down a photographer on the pavement and a white-shirted supervisor twisting an arm, among scores taken during Occupy Wall Street protests. An officer knocking a bicyclist to the ground during a Critical Mass protest ride, and another dancing provocatively with a barely clad paradegoer.\nA dog being shot. Officers on trial, or sleeping in uniform on a subway train.\nIt was an embarrassing stumble for what has, in recent weeks, been an aggressive effort by the Police Department to engage with New Yorkers on social media, particularly on the short messaging service.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/nyregion/new-york-police-reach-out-on-twitter-but-receive-a-slap-in-the-face.html?ref=nyregion"}
