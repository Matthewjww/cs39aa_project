Timoney, approved the policy last week, before a Miami-Dade police officer was killed on Thursday in a shootout with a man wielding an assault rifle.\n“This is something we do not do with any relish,” Chief Timoney said. “We do this reluctantly.”\nThe policy had been under review for about a year after officers began seeing an increase in the weapons in the hands of criminals, the chief said.\nOfficers interested in the guns will have to undergo two days of training and be certified in their use. The Police Department does not yet have money to buy the assault rifles, and if officers want to use them immediately they will have to pay for them, Chief Timoney said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/17/us/17miami.html"}
