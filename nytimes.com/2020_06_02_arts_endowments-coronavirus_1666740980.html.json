The board of this museum, the endowment, the assets in its warehouses that never see the light of day — all capable of making this shortfall and keeping those people employed,” was one reaction on Twitter, by Jonathan T.D. Neil, the director of Claremont Graduate University’s Center for Business & Management of the Arts, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s decision to lay off some museum staff.\nBut even those who are accessing endowment funds in ways they have never done before consider these funds to be critical bulwarks to their organizations and plan to only increase their spending temporarily.\n“This is unprecedented, like so many things during this crisis,” said David Gordon, a former director of the Milwaukee Art Museum who consults with cultural institutions. “There has been for quite a while an emphasis on building up the endowments so there will be a great reluctance to dip into them.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/arts/endowments-coronavirus.html"}
