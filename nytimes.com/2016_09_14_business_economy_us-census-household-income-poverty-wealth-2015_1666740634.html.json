The share of Americans living in poverty also posted the sharpest decline in decades.\nThe gains were an important milestone for the economic expansion that began in 2009. For the first time in recent years, the benefits of renewed prosperity are spreading broadly.\nThe data was released into a heated presidential race, where Democrats seized on the statistics to promote Hillary Clinton’s candidacy and undercut Donald J. Trump’s dark assessment of the nation’s well-being.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/business/economy/us-census-household-income-poverty-wealth-2015.html"}
