Trump, a Republican, to work on behalf of all Americans.\nIt was a deeply felt and altogether rare appeal from the stage of a Broadway show — and it drew a surprisingly sharp rebuke from Mr. Trump on Saturday morning. The president-elect wrote in a post on Twitter that the “Hamilton” cast had “harassed” Mr. Pence by making the statement and had been “very rude.”\n“Apologize!” Mr. Trump wrote at the end of one of two posts on the matter.\nAs the play ended, the actor who played Vice President Aaron Burr, Brandon Victor Dixon, acknowledged that Mr. Pence was in the audience, thanked him for attending and added, “We hope you will hear us out.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/us/mike-pence-hamilton.html"}
