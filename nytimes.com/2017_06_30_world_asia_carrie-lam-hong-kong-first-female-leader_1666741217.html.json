Mr. Xi said the “one country, two systems” model, under which the city maintains autonomy in local government and its legal, economic and financial systems, was facing “new situations” and “new problems.” He pledged the central government’s continuing support to Hong Kong.\nThe ceremony, in a large convention center along Victoria Harbor, came hours before thousands of demonstrators planned to gather for an annual march to protest the lack of full democracy in Hong Kong.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/world/asia/carrie-lam-hong-kong-first-female-leader.html"}
