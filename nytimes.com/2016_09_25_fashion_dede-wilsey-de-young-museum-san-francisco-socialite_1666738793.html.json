No one was going to run her out, she added. She would remain, overseeing politics and fund-raising. And to her detractors she would like to say: “You will look like a bunch of idiots. And I am going to laugh myself silly.”\nDeep Connections\nSan Francisco has long had its share of society scandals to titillate everyone from the bohos of Haight-Ashbury to the swells on Nob Hill. People here still recall when the oil scion Gordon Getty revealed in 1999 that he had a second family in Los Angeles while married to his wife, Ann. But nothing in the recent past has captivated the city’s gossips more than the travails of Diane Wilsey, known as Dede, a daughter of privilege who moved to San Francisco in 1965 and made a name for herself as one of the city’s most prominent fund-raisers.\nHer name is on the Diane B. Wilsey Center for the Opera. She raised funds to restore Grace Cathedral, one of the city’s fabled landmarks, and a Catholic girls school in the Mission District. But Ms. Wilsey is best known for her patronage of the de Young in Golden Gate Park. Many people credit her with saving it after the original 1919 structure was damaged in the 1989 earthquake. She led the campaign to raise $208 million to build a new one, donating $10 million herself and sweet-talking or strong-arming the balance through her deep connections to Northern California’s aristocrats.\nBut friends and others who acknowledge her charitable works say she can be dismissive of less prominent peers, especially those who clash with her. Her stepson, Sean Wilsey, cast her as a ruthless gold digger in his acclaimed 2005 memoir, “Oh, the Glory of It All.”\n“She can laugh and joke with anyone, even a truck driver,” said Harry Parker, the Fine Arts Museums’ director from 1987 to 2005. “Her failing is that she has not always listened to what people told her if they didn’t have social standing.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/fashion/dede-wilsey-de-young-museum-san-francisco-socialite.html"}
