In “The Hand That First Held Mine” and “The Distance Between Us,” characters separated by many miles or many years turn out to be joined in ways they never anticipated. In other books, like “The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox” and “After You’d Gone,” women confined to hospital wards slowly reveal secrets that both bind and unbind their families.\nO’Farrell appears to be fascinated by the idea that the visible connections of kinship or marriage are often not the entire story — and not even the actual story — of what holds us close to one another. Secrets and lies pervade her fictional worlds, and they always tumble out to satisfying effect. She has made her mark by combining the elements of good old-­fashioned drama — love affairs in the shadows, the reappearance of long-lost relatives, hidden wives — with a modern lightness of touch in language and a deft freedom in moving her narratives forward through juxtaposition rather than linear plotting. For the reader, this can feel like having one’s cake and eating it too. O’Farrell’s novels appeal to a broad audience, but they’re also smart and provocative. Over and over, they try to work out who people really are, how ordinary lives can conceal extraordinary stories.\nOf course, a secret is no good if it doesn’t need to be a secret. It can be difficult to get traction on something truly, explosively clandestine in our highly disclosing world, which may be one reason O’Farrell has set her latest novel, “Instructions for a Heatwave,” in 1976 London, a time and place more conducive to the keeping of secrets.\nThe Riordan family is thrown into crisis by the inexplicable and sudden disappearance of its patriarch, Robert, a retired bank employee, husband to Gretta and father to three adult children, Michael Francis, Monica and Aoife. Robert, apparently, walks away one hot morning. As Gretta reaches out to her children for help in finding him, it becomes clear that they may need as much help finding themselves. Much of the book centers on the troubles and troubled interconnections of the Riordan siblings, all of whom are holding certain cards close to their chests.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/maggie-ofarrells-instructions-for-a-heatwave.html"}
