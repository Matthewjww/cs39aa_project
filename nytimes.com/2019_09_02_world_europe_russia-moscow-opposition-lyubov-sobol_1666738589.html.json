Navalny, another anti-corruption campaigner; Nikolai Lyaskin; and Ilya Azar, a journalist with Novaya Gazeta, an independent daily newspaper, and a local councilor.\nMs. Sobol, the most prominent of the activists known to have been picked up on Monday, has been one of the main public faces of a recent wave of protests, including a peaceful march attended by several thousand people that she led on Saturday through the center of Moscow.\nReleased from provisional arrest after midnight pending a court hearing, Ms. Sobol said on her Twitter account after her release that she had been picked up by police officers as she was leaving a store and accused of taking part in an illegal gathering.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/world/europe/russia-moscow-opposition-lyubov-sobol.html"}
