He said the Trump administration was “almost done” preparing its peace plan and would roll it out soon.\nHe appeared to be attempting to goad Mr. Abbas into talks the leader has vowed to boycott, while doing considerable pre-emptive damage control in the event that Mr. Abbas does not relent.\n[Read the White House’s transcript of Jared Kushner’s interview.]\nBut Mr. Kushner offered little in the way of enticements to Mr. Abbas. Asked what the leaders of other Arab nations wanted to see in an Israel-Palestinian settlement, the White House aide mentioned nothing about a sovereign Palestinian state or of Palestinian refugees.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/world/middleeast/kushner-abbas-peace-deal-israel.html"}
