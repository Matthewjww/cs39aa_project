Police officers in China generally do not carry firearms. China plans to introduce the armed police patrols in several major cities and started last Thursday in Xiâ€™an and over the weekend in Shanghai and Qingdao. The state Public Security Ministry said the campaign for armed police patrols also would extend to the southern cities of Changsha and Kunming, as well the main cities in the restive ethnic regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, although those areas already have experienced tight security crackdowns that include armed paramilitary police.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/world/asia/china-some-police-officers-begin-to-carry-guns-in-several-cities.html"}
