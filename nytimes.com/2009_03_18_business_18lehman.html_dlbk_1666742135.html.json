Fuld Jr., caused the firm to misstate its financial position when the state bought $182 million of Lehman shares in April and June 2008.\nThe purchases were made when Lehman was having trouble raising capital and attracting investors in the months leading up to its September bankruptcy filing.\nThis is the second lawsuit from a governmental entity that names former Lehman executives as defendants. Because direct claims against the firm are stayed by bankruptcy proceedings, former Lehman executives have been named instead. Last November, San Mateo County, Calif., accused Mr. Fuld and other Lehman executives of making false statements that had led to a $150 million loss in the county’s investment pool.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/business/18lehman.html?dlbk"}
