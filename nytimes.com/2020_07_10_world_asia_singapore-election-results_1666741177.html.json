Their temperatures had been checked. Before receiving their ballots, they spritzed their hands with sanitizer, and many put on disposable gloves.\nIf any country could successfully carry out a general election during a global pandemic, it was surely Singapore, a rich, manicured city-state with a population that has largely been conditioned to follow the rules.\nThe winner was never in doubt, either, even though balloting was extended by two hours to accommodate the long lines.\nBut while victory went to the center-right People’s Action Party, which has held power longer than any other elected political party in the world, results released early Saturday showed a surprising slip in its support. Its share of the popular vote fell to 61 percent, a nearly nine-point swing from elections five years ago. The leading opposition party took a record 10 of Parliament’s 93 seats.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/world/asia/singapore-election-results.html"}
