I was at the Museum of American History.” “Before DACA I always felt like I was in between two worlds. I was born in Honduras. But if I were to go back to Honduras, it’s like I’m foreign to them.” “It’s a tug of war. When you’re undocumented, you’re always just aware of the situations, of the locations, who you were talking to, how you are interacting with folks, ensuring that you don’t do anything that will bring attention to you because you live a life of shadows.” “You know, I have been able to accomplish a lot more than when I was undocumented. To get a social security number, loans from the bank, a better job.” “Every time my parents call me after 11 p.m., it’s like my heart is racing. When you are an immigrant in this country, you wake up every day with the fear that you could be taken away, right, that your family could be broken up.” “I have been preparing my kids of, for, you know, These are the risk[s]. This could happen to your dad and to me.” “I just can’t imagine, you know, my nieces and nephews being separated from their parents or them going back to a country that they don’t know because this is their home. They shouldn’t live with that fear that I had to grow up with. That’s not a normal life. That’s not normal. And I know that like my friends that are U.S. citizens don’t go through that. And nobody should go through that.” “I’m not leaving my home, and I think if Trump ever wanted to talk to us, if he wanted to talk to these Dreamers he would realize that we love this country. We want to stay here, and ... ” “ ... if it’s taken away, I’m losing my job, I’m losing the opportunity to work and school. People don’t understand but it’s a big thing, it’s a huge thing, it’s privileges that some people here take for granted.” “Taking DACA away is like taking a family member away from me. That wall that Donald Trump wants to build, you know, it’s putting a wall in front of me where I won’t be able to move forward. You are not just taking something away from us, but you’re taking something away from this country.” “This land is not a white America. It’s not. This is a land of immigrants.” “I mean, I was already a person before DACA. A lot of people say, ‘Oh, you know, what’s going to happen after DACA?’ I’m not going down without a fight.” “You know, whatever happens next, I love this country and I belong here.” “I’m fighting for my family, “I’m fighting for the friends of mine that can’t even stand up because they’re scared.” “We just want to stay here and contribute to this country, to the economy ... We are good people. We’re not criminals.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/trump-daca-improper.html?_r=0"}
