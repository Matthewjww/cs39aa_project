Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called the plot “totally unacceptable,” Denmark recalled its ambassador to Iran, and potential joint European action is on the agenda for a meeting of European Union foreign ministers on Nov. 19.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated the Danish government on Twitter on “its arrest of an Iranian regime assassin.”\n“There is sufficient basis to conclude that an Iranian intelligence service has been planning the assassination,” the Danish Security and Intelligence Service said in a statement released on Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/world/europe/denmark-assassination-iran.html"}
