But now many analysts say they fear that the offensive could backfire, drawing Saudi Arabia into a quagmire in a mountainous tribal area and possibly even luring foreign fighters to join the rebels.\nWorst of all, some say, the border skirmish could lead to the realization of Saudi Arabia’s worst fear: a proxy conflict with its archrival, Iran, on its doorstep.\nThe rebels, known as Houthis, after their leader’s clan, have long been accused of receiving support from Iran for their struggle against the Yemeni government, though little evidence has been produced.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/world/middleeast/13saudi.html"}
