Or an automatic double, as many people on social media referred to it?\nThe answer is closer to the latter, by the definition of the term “ground rule.” But in colloquial usage, the terms have become somewhat interchangeable.\nUnlike sports with uniform specifications for their fields, baseball has always allowed for at least some variance. As a result, parks have developed sets of ground rules, separate from the standard rules of the game, to account for quirks caused by the park’s design and location.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/sports/baseball/ground-rule-double.html"}
