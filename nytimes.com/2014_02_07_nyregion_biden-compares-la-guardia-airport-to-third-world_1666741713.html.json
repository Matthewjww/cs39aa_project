Biden says La Guardia Airport in New York could use some major improvements — and that is putting it mildly.\nMr. Biden said that if he blindfolded someone and took him to La Guardia, the person would think he was in “some third world country.”\nMr. Biden made the comment in Philadelphia on Thursday night in a comparison with Hong Kong International Airport. He said Hong Kong had the kind of modern facilities travelers expect to see in the United States.\nIn his talk, he stressed the need for infrastructure improvement.\nMr. Biden focused on Amtrak, which just unveiled a new electric locomotive. But he said the nation’s ports and airports also needed upgrading.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/nyregion/biden-compares-la-guardia-airport-to-third-world.html"}
