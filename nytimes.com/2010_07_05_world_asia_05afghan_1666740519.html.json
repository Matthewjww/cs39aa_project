David H. Petraeus took command of the troubled Afghan war on Sunday, warning of hard days to come but promising to persevere until the government and army here are strong enough to stand on their own.\n“We are engaged in a tough fight,” he told a gathering of Afghan leaders and American and NATO officers at a ceremony here. “After years of war, we have arrived at a critical moment.”\n“We must demonstrate to the people and to the Taliban that Afghan and I.S.A.F. forces are here to safeguard the Afghan people, and that we are in this to win,” he said, referring to the American-led coalition. “That is our clear objective.”\nThe ceremony, at NATO headquarters in central Kabul, had a subdued air, coming only days after the previous commander, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, was fired by President Obama for remarks he made to a magazine reporter. General Petraeus paid tribute to his predecessor, and many of General McChrystal’s senior officers attended, still in their jobs.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/world/asia/05afghan.html"}
