Within the NATO alliance, which has closely monitored the ebb and flow of Moscow’s forces, many officials doubt that President Vladimir V. Putin’s military, battered and demoralized by nearly eight months of war, has the will or the means to open a new front.\nOn Friday there was heavy fighting in Luhansk Province in the east, and there have been signs that the Kremlin may abandon parts of Kherson Province in the south, which would mean the surrender of territory seized at the start of the war and which Mr. Putin last week declared part of the Russian Federation.\nAlso on Friday, the U.S. defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei K. Shoigu, spoke with each other by phone for the first time since May and only the second time since the war began. Their respective offices confirmed in statements that the call took place and dealt with Ukraine, but did not offer any specifics or say whether Belarus was discussed.\nMr. Lukashenko, Belarus’s increasingly Moscow-dependent president, announced last week that his country and Russia were forming a new joint military force, with 70,000 Belarusian troops and up to 15,000 Russians, putatively to guard against NATO.\nA Ukrainian general, Oleksiy Gromov, said on Thursday that the threat of a possible invasion from Belarus was growing. But Ukraine’s military intelligence agency does not see an immediate danger, a spokesman, Vadym Skibitsky, said in an interview on Friday.\nSeveral thousand newly mobilized Russian soldiers are deployed in Belarus at training sites, Mr. Skibitsky said, but they are not accompanied by the tanks, artillery or fuel trucks and other logistical support they would need to invade and face Ukraine’s battle-hardened troops.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/world/europe/ukraine-belarus-russian-troops.html"}
