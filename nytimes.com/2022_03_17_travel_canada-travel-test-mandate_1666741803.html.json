All air travelers may still be selected at random to take PCR tests upon arrival at airports, and unvaccinated or partially vaccinated travelers will still be required to take a test one day before flying.\nCanada will also continue to require all travelers to submit a health information form before entering Canada. Those who arrive without having submitted a completed form may be required to take a test and to quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status.\n“Adjustments to Canada’s border measures are made possible by a number of factors, including Canada’s high vaccination rate, the increasing availability and use of rapid tests to detect infection, decreasing hospitalizations and growing domestic availability of treatments for Covid-19,” Jean-Yves Duclos, the country’s health minister, said at a news conference on Thursday.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/travel/canada-travel-test-mandate.html"}
