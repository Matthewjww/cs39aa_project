The results in each setting, while still preliminary, all suggested that the variant was less likely to send people in hospitals.\n“Given that this is everywhere and given that it’s going to be so transmissible, anything that would lower severity is going to be better,” said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta.\nSince the discovery of the Omicron variant in southern Africa in November, scientists have struggled to learn whether it causes more severe illness compared with other variants — and if so, in whom.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html"}
