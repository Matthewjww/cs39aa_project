Top officials at the agency, including political appointees, have been frustrated in recent weeks by comments Mr. Trump has made about his contact with pharmaceutical companies and his efforts to speed progress on vaccines, giving the impression the White House is playing a regulatory role.\nThe statement in USA Today was written in large part because of fears over political influence on the F.D.A., including from the White House, according to senior administration officials familiar with the effort.\nDr. Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, praised the statement on Thursday, writing on Twitter that members of the group “took the initiative to independently express their steadfast trust in the expertise and commitment of our organization.”\n“I wholeheartedly agree with them,” he said.\nThe specter of political arm-twisting with vaccine approvals has grown as several drugmakers entered large late-stage trials this summer. Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday that “we’re going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I’m talking about.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/us/politics/fda-coronavirus-vaccine.html"}
