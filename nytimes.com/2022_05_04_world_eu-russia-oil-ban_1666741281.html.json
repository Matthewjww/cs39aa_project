But we simply have to work on it.”\nHer announcement was greeted with applause by the members of Parliament, reflecting the broad consensus that the measure, while difficult to take and potentially economically painful for Europeans, has been long anticipated as necessary to start depriving President Vladimir V. Putin of cash needed to fund the war.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/04/world/eu-russia-oil-ban.html"}
