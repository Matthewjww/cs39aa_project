It added that it would create a $1.5 billion investment fund to train American engineers.\n“This will ensure America’s lead in future wireless technology,” Broadcom said.\nThe response came after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions’ national security implications, ordered a delay of Qualcomm’s shareholder meeting as Broadcom sought to win a majority of the company’s board seats.\nThat proactive move, all but unprecedented in the history of the panel, highlighted both how much the White House values the wireless technology known as 5G as a matter of national security and its fears of falling behind China in the race to develop the standard. The decision put a spotlight on efforts to expand the reach of the panel, known as Cfius, as a way to bolster the White House’s nationalist economic agenda.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/business/dealbook/broadcom-qualcomm-5g-cfius.html"}
