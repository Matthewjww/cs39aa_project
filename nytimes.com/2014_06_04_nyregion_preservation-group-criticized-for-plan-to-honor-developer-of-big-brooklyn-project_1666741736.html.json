Ratner its highest honor, one named for the very person who led some of those fights.\nNext week, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal — a recognition of “individuals who, by their work and deeds, have made an outstanding contribution to New York City” — is to be given to Mr. Ratner and his successor as chief executive of Forest City Ratner, MaryAnne Gilmartin.\nTheir contributions are such skyline-defining and neighborhood-altering projects as the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, a downtown apartment tower by Frank Gehry and the headquarters of The New York Times.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/nyregion/preservation-group-criticized-for-plan-to-honor-developer-of-big-brooklyn-project.html"}
