To qualify, a candidate must either reach 1 percent in three approved polls or raise money from at least 65,000 donors in 20 states, with at least 200 unique donors in each state. Each candidateâ€™s slot will be selected by a random drawing.\nThe criteria will apply only to the first two debates, scheduled for back-to-back weeknights in June and July, allowing the committee to update its requirements as the field shifts. NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo are sponsoring the first debate, and CNN will host the second, with specific dates and locations to be announced in the coming weeks.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/democratic-debates-2020.html"}
