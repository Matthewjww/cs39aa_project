On Tuesday he said that the social, psychological and educational costs of keeping children at home would be worse than the virus itself. Education policy is largely controlled by state and local officials, so Mr. Trump does not have authority over whether systems reopen.\nThe details of reopening will vary widely between districts depending on the virus’ spread, which is why a return to school may look very different in New York, where transmission is currently low, than in Phoenix, where cases are increasing.\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has authority over when schools across the state, including in New York City, can reopen. Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have long feuded over schools, and Mr. Cuomo could still halt the mayor’s timeline for reopening.\nThe governor did not contradict Mr. de Blasio on Wednesday. Instead, he reiterated that he has the ultimate decision about whether to reopen schools at all, and that his office will make those decisions in the first week of August. The governor said he expected some parents to decide whether to send their children back to school in person the night before reopening.\nUnder Mr. de Blasio’s plan, school principals will spend July determining which of three staggered schedule options to adopt. That decision will depend on how many students and staff can fit into school buildings while social distancing, and on how many families want their children to return to school in the first place.\nSchool leaders will let parents know in August which days children can report to school, and which days they will learn remotely.\nThe city’s models are based on current federal guidelines that recommend six feet of distance between students.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/nyc-schools-reopening-plan.html"}
