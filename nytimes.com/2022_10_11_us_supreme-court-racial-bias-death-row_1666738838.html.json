The court’s three liberal members dissented, saying that the jurors’ racial prejudice deprived the inmate, Andre Lee Thomas, of a fair trial.\nMr. Thomas was convicted of murdering his wife, who was white, their son and his wife’s daughter from an earlier relationship. Prosecutors agreed that he was psychotic at the time, though they said he had voluntarily induced the psychosis by drinking cough medicine.\nMr. Thomas tried to remove his victim’s hearts to, he said, “set them free from evil.” While awaiting trial, he removed one of his eyes. Years later, he removed the other one.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/11/us/supreme-court-racial-bias-death-row.html"}
