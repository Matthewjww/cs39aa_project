I would ask for their cooperation and understanding and remember what we are trying to balance. We are trying to balance aid to West Africa and protection and the public health of New Yorkers and addressing the fear and concern of New Yorkers. We have spoken many times about the reality of Ebola. It is not an especially new disease. It was discovered in 1976. It is not like the flu. It is not easily caught. All the evidence says that it is transmitted through bodily fluids once the person is infected and highly contagious. So, there is no cause for general alarm but again we want the people of New York to know we are staying one step ahead. We are doing everything possible. Some people will say we are being too cautious. I will take that criticism because that is better than the alternative. As Governor of New York, my number one job is to protect the people of New York and this does that.” WHITE FLASH 3. (SOUNDBITE) (English) NEW YORK STATE GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO SAYING: “From an operational, efficiency point of view and from a safety point of view, the preferred option is to ask them to stay home. The health care worker will come to their house twice a day, they can have their family, whoever is normally there, it is not that they are stopping their life. They have their full life. But, if they become symptomatic, you will have limited the number of people they will have been in contact with.” WHITE FLASH 4. (SOUNDBITE) (English) NEW YORK STATE GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO SAYING: “Well, the White House first of all and CDC will establish a protocol. They are yet to establish their protocol for this situation and we have to operate now. Right, we live in the here and now. Number two, whatever the CDC comes up with, they will be the first to say, I believe, that they understand states have different needs and what New York needs, is different than what Nebraska may need, is different than what Kansas may need, is different than what Florida may need. So, CDC will come up with general operating protocols, but the states are free to design their own protocols. If there is a region in the country that has more differences than New York, New Jersey, I don’t know of one. But, this will be consistent. It will probably be somewhat safer than what CDC comes up with once they come up with their definitive protocol. But, I will take that criticism if you want to call it a criticism that I want to be safer than CDC says, fine.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/nyregion/ebola-quarantine.html"}
