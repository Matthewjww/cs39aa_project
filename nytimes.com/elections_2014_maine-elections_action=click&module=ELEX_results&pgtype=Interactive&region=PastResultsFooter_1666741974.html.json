Paul R. LePage, a Republican running for a second term, defeated his Democratic opponent, Representative Michael H. Michaud, who conceded the race shortly after midnight.\nVoters rebuffed appeals from nationally prominent Democrats, including President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who appeared on stage at campaign rallies for Mr. Michaud in the last few weeks.\nMr. LePage, the blunt-spoken, tough-talking former mayor of Waterville, had often been listed as one of the nationâ€™s most endangered governors. Maine Democrats called him a national embarrassment. But his conservative agenda, including a promise to trim state budgets and reduce welfare rolls, evidently resonated with voters.\nWhite House officials had assumed that if Mr. Michaud won, Maine would quickly agree to expand Medicaid, as Mr. Obama wants. Mr. LePage has vetoed several efforts to do just that.\nGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, visited Maine several times to help Mr. LePage, and the association poured money into the state to support that effort.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/maine-elections?action=click&module=ELEX_results&pgtype=Interactive&region=PastResultsFooter"}
