He has not announced his timetable for carrying through on that pledge as president.\nMr. Trump’s pick for secretary of the Treasury, Stephen T. Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager, also has promised to “kill” parts of the law, including the so-called Volcker rule restricting banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments of the kind that led to the 2008-9 global economic crisis.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/politics/trump-dodd-frank-regulations.html"}
