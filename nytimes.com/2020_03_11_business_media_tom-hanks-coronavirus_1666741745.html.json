Slight fevers, too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.”\nHe added that he and Ms. Wilson “will be tested, observed and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.”\n“Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?” Mr. Hanks said in his statement, which he also posted on Instagram accompanied by a photograph of a lone medical glove in a hazardous waste container. “We’ll keep the world posted and updated.”", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/business/media/tom-hanks-coronavirus.html"}
