I know he loves me. I feel it all the time. I don’t need to ask for his love. I don’t need to wonder. I tell him I love him for a simple reason: Nothing could be more true.\nBut he doesn’t say it back. Mostly I’ve said it when we’re leaving each other, a couple of times over the phone, once when I was drunk, another time when he was hurt and I was trying to be supportive. There’s always silence for a moment, and then he says something like, “Yeah, bro, I’ll catch you soon.”\nI don’t need him to say those exact words to me. I wonder, though, about what keeps him from saying them. What keeps nearly all young men from being able to tell their male friends that they love them?\nThis is the first time, in this piece, that I zoom out. In personal essays we are usually inspecting one life, with the quiet hope that what we say will somehow feel true about many other lives. I think a writer’s instinct should always be toward the individual, the small. But here, and in a couple other places in the essay, I did want to gaze up from my life a bit and draw a line to other lives, to other boys who maybe experienced something similar to what I experienced.\nWhen I was 8, I made my first best friend. Pedro was twig-thin, messy-haired and jittery, brimming with the kind of untamed tenderness found only in children. When I moved to Philadelphia, he took me — a nervous new boy at school — in his arms and under his wings.\nJumps in time are inevitable in essay writing. My feeling about time-jumps is that they should feel natural, which to me means they should mimic the movements of the human mind — how we remember the past and imagine the future — since I think essays are, at their best, the experience of someone’s mind. While there is no exact formula for how to move between time periods in your writing, what’s most critical is that these movements never feel arbitrary. Here, the time-jump I employ is a common one, found often in both literature and life: We are presented with a problem in the present, then we must look back to experience and examine its origins.\nPedro and I spent our weekends on walks with his mother through the forest trails near their house. He and I walked slowly, holding hands while we stepped, interlocking our fingers. To this day, whenever I participate in the sacred human practice of hand holding, I think of Pedro.\nOn one of our walks, Pedro and I were interrupted by another boy, Pedro’s neighbor, who chopped his hand between ours, startling us.\n“You two hold hands?” he said. “That’s gay.”\nI remember not knowing exactly what “gay” meant, but sensing in the way other boys wielded the word that it meant something you didn’t want to be. I had a terrible feeling that the outside world had broken into our quiet green place. Pedro and I never held hands again.\nI think every essay has a couple fundamental questions, and those questions need to lurk and linger throughout the writing in unexpected ways. In this piece, one question of mine was: What can words mean to us? I’m thinking about this mostly in terms of the word “love,” but I did want to visit it briefly, here, with the word “gay.” It was a word I knew as a boy only by its implications and consequences, and not by its meaning. So this paragraph ties to an earlier one about how people mean many things when they say “I love you”; the connective tissue is that we are almost never saying exactly what we mean, and, in further truth, that words never mean absolutely one thing.\nHe and I still cared for each other, but that day we learned our care was something we needed to regulate, subdue, place in a chokehold and never let loose. We learned this at the hands of another boy our age, who probably had learned it at the hands of another boy of whatever age.\nPedro and I learned what men in America have learned repeatedly: that tenderness must be tamed in accordance with a set of codes we must become fluent in, as if our survival depends on it. This lesson is learned over many years, passed between generations, and like the best-taught lessons, it claws into you until you can hardly distinguish where the lesson ends and you begin.\nMost paragraphs in a narrative can be divided into two categories: scene and idea. Scenes are the moments and actions we depict, and ideas are our thinking around those moments and actions. In this paragraph, I am moving from scene — this moment between Pedro and I — into idea — my thinking about what my experience with Pedro indicates or represents about the larger world. There’s no perfect ratio of scenes to ideas — every essay requires something different! — but there should be a balance. You want your scenes to be the shadow of your ideas, and your ideas to be the shadow of your scenes; it should feel like each has been leading you right to the other. Sometimes, I print out an essay and highlight the scene sections in one color and the idea sections in another, and look to see if I need to do any suturing or rearranging. Also, ideas have always come more naturally to me, so — like sports players who intentionally practice their weakest shots — I always make an effort to practice scene in my writing.\nSomewhere inside each man is a list of all the other men he’s loved without ever finding the words to tell them so.\nThis is one of the first lines I wrote in this piece, and when I first wrote it down, it meant a lot to me. Reading the whole piece over now, I actually think it would have been the right decision to cut it, to let readers arrive at this idea for themselves, in their own words, instead of handing it to them. I point this out because it’s demonstrative of one of my most firmly held beliefs about writing: that sometimes we write things that lead us to other, better things, and then we no longer need those original things. But often, we get too attached to our original words and keep them out of some strange sense of loyalty, thereby not giving space for the new, better things to come. I always think about how rockets have pieces of themselves that fall off mid-flight. Those pieces help rockets get up to a certain point, and then, when they become more of a weight than they are useful, the rocket is designed to let them fall away. Sometimes we need to thank a line or section of writing for its service to us, for having gotten us to where we’ve arrived with our piece, and then: let it fall away.\nI met Kichi in the middle of my freshman year, when I was once again a nervous new kid, this time throwing a party. I have gone through life with a rotating set of anxious tics. That year, I had become fond of swinging my university lanyard with my key in circles, wrapping and unwrapping it around my finger.\nWhen people started flowing into my dorm room, I began my nervous swinging, not noticing what I was doing until I heard a crack and saw that my key had struck a stranger’s iPhone screen, leaving a minor scratch. That stranger was Kichi.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/learning/annotated-by-the-author-why-cant-men-say-i-love-you-to-each-other.html"}
