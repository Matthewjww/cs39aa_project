As they came to a stop, five workers picked through the small items, placing each one in a cardboard box.\nAt Obeta, an electrical parts company that opened in 1901, it is the kind of monotonous task workers have performed for years.\nBut several months ago, a new worker joined the team. Stationed behind protective glass, a robot using three suction cups at the end of its long arm does the same job, sifting through parts with surprising speed and accuracy.\nWhile it may not seem like much, this component-sorting robot is a major advance in artificial intelligence and the ability of machines to perform human labor.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/technology/warehouse-robot.html"}
