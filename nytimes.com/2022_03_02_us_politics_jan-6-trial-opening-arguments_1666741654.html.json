Nestler, a federal prosecutor, said in an opening statement. “He wanted to stop Congress from doing its job.”\nAs the trial unfolds over the next several days, the government intends to offer evidence that Mr. Reffitt, 41, had a standoff with the police outside the Capitol after traveling to Washington from his home in Wylie, Texas. Prosecutors say Mr. Reffitt came to Washington with a fellow member of the Texas Three Percenters, a loosely organized militia movement that takes its name from the supposed 3 percent of the U.S. colonial population that fought against the British.\nMr. Nestler said that prosecutors would introduce messages that Mr. Reffitt had sent to other members of the group in advance of the attack, saying that “the fuel is set” and that he planned to “strike the match in DC on Jan. 6.” The Three Percenter who traveled with him to Washington, Rocky Hardy, is set to testify under an immunity deal with the government.\nProsecutors also plan to elicit testimony from two of Mr. Reffitt’s children, Jackson and Peyton, who were teenagers at the time of the attack. The children plan to say their father threatened them after he returned to Texas in order to keep them from turning him in to the authorities.\nA large man with a barrel chest and a pigtail, Mr. Reffitt sat without showing much emotion as Mr. Nestler told the jury how he had led a large group of rioters up a staircase at the Capitol, just outside the Senate chamber, brushing off attempts by the police to stop him with pepper balls and heavier projectiles. Even after he was finally subdued with a canister of pepper spray, Mr. Reffitt urged the crowd around him to push on, Mr. Nestler said.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/us/politics/jan-6-trial-opening-arguments.html"}
