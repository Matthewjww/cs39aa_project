The law makes an exemption for religious organizations.\nTwenty-one other states and the District of Columbia have similar laws. Greg Johnson, a law professor at Vermont Law School, said the suit could set a precedent as more states legalize same-sex marriage. Currently, same-sex marriage is legal in six states and the District of Columbia, all of which protect gay men and lesbians in their public-accommodations laws.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/20/us/20vermont.html"}
