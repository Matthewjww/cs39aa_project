His face was emblazoned on banners, T-shirts and even on Germany’s pre-1918 imperial flag, popular with neo-Nazis in the crowd of 50,000 who had come to protest Germany’s pandemic restrictions. His name was invoked by many with messianic zeal.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/world/europe/germany-trump-far-right.html"}
