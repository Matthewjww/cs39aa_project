Here are my picks for outstanding apps of 2016:\nNUZZEL Though Nuzzel was released in 2015, it gained more popularity this year as people realized how clever it was. The app is a news aggregator with a trick: It curates news items users may be interested in because their friends or followers on Facebook and Twitter have already read and shared them. This social angle works well and I find Nuzzel’s home page is always worth scanning.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/personaltech/best-apps.html"}
