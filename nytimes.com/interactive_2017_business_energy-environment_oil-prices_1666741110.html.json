That confidence was shaken by a price dip in early March, but most experts say they think oil and gasoline prices will recover during the heavy driving season in the summer.\nNonetheless, the oil markets could be poised for another wild ride, with Wall Street and academic analysts predicting a price of anywhere between $40 and $70 by the end of the year. Wide swings are possible, if not probable. Political and economic upheaval in a major oil-producing country like Venezuela could cause a price spike.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/business/energy-environment/oil-prices.html"}
