In bold capital letters, the ad asks, “Why There?”\nIn the suit, the ad’s sponsor, the American Freedom Defense Initiative, which is run by Pamela Geller, a prominent right-wing blogger, claimed that the firm that handles advertising for the transit agency had infringed on its right to free speech by repeatedly requesting changes to the ad, like removing the image of the plane.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/nyregion/10mta.html"}
