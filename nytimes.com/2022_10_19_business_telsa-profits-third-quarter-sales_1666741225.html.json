It reported revenue of $21.5 billion, up from $13.8 billion.\nTesla said this month that it had produced more than 365,000 cars in the third quarter, a 50 percent increase from a year earlier. Sales also surged but investors have grown increasingly concerned about signs that suggest that demand for the companyâ€™s luxury cars might be weakening.\nTesla sold about 20,000 fewer cars than it made in the third quarter and wait times for its vehicles have been falling. Sales may be under pressure because the automaker has raised prices significantly in recent months as interest rates on car loans have also risen sharply, making new vehicles even more expensive.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/business/telsa-profits-third-quarter-sales.html"}
