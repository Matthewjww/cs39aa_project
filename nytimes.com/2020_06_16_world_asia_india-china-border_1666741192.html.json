The violence is a continuation of a decades-old dispute between the two nuclear powers over the precise location of their Himalayan border.\nWhat is the ‘Line of Actual Control’ and why does it matter?\nSix decades ago, India and China went to war over a border dispute that ended with an uneasy truce in 1962.\nWhile no border has ever officially been negotiated along the forbidding stretch of land high in the Himalayas that divides the two nations, the truce established a 2,100-mile-long Line of Actual Control.\nSince then, an uneasy peace has held. But every time there is a flare-up of violence, the world watches anxiously.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/world/asia/india-china-border.html"}
