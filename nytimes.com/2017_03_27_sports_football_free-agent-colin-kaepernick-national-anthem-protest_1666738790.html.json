So did Josh McCown and E. J. Manuel.\nBut Colin Kaepernick, who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl just four years ago, remains unemployed.\nIs Kaepernick not qualified to play quarterback in the N.F.L. anymore? Or is it something else?\nSome skeptical fans are wondering if the quarterbacks who have landed jobs with teams have one significant asset that Kaepernick does not have: They all stood for the national anthem last season. Kaepernick knelt in protest against racism and police brutality. That decision was unpopular with a segment of N.F.L. fans, and perhaps a larger segment of traditionally conservative N.F.L. owners. It even drew a rebuke from Donald J. Trump when he was a presidential candidate and later as president.\nSimilar vexing questions were raised a few years ago when Michael Sam, an all-American linebacker in college, was all but ignored by N.F.L. teams after he publicly came out as gay. He was never regarded as a potential star, but many fans found it curious that such a successful college player could not play a down in the N.F.L.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/sports/football/free-agent-colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest.html"}
