The increase from the fourth quarter was smaller, however. In the final quarter of 2016, Tesla delivered 22,252 cars and S.U.V.s.\nThe first-quarter total is a preliminary figure that could change when the company reports its first-quarter earnings next month. Tesla also said it produced a record 25,418 vehicles in the quarter, up from 15,510 a year ago, although again the rise was much smaller when compared with the fourth quarter, when it built 24,882 cars.\nThe company currently offers the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X S.U.V., both of which can sell for $90,000 or more once options are included. In July, it plans to begin production of the Model 3 â€” a compact car the company hopes to sell for $35,000 and produce in significantly higher volume.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/02/business/tesla-reports-jump-in-vehicle-production.html"}
