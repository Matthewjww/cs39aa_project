If enacted, it would essentially stop countries from slashing their tax rates to lure businesses, a move that the United States and other high-tax jurisdictions say has deprived them of funding for crucial investments like infrastructure and education. Critical details still need to be worked out, including how to execute the plan, which is expected to be finalized in October, the economic cooperation organization said. Those details could also determine which American multinationals are subject to the new rules on digital taxation, which exclude financial services companies and those in extractive industries like oil and gas. And after that, new digital taxes and global corporate minimum taxes would still need to be approved by Congress and national legislatures. The organization estimates that over $100 billion of corporate profits would be reallocated from companies’ home countries to other markets where they operate. Large emerging markets like India are expected to reap a tax windfall, though a big chunk would also go to wealthy countries like France and Germany, which say they have been deprived of funding by countries that use lower taxes to attract an inordinate amount of tax revenue. The agreement is a victory for the Biden administration, which reinvigorated the negotiations this year with a new proposal for a global minimum tax. But it also builds on groundwork laid by Treasury Department negotiators under President Donald J. Trump. Still, not everyone has signed on. Smaller nations that have long benefited from being tax havens are holding out for better terms, raising the prospect of a clash with bigger countries. Conspicuously absent from the accord is Ireland, which has resisted a 15 percent minimum tax as it is reluctant to lose its status as a major tax haven in Europe. Its low corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent helped fuel the so-called Celtic Tiger economy for years, attracting Apple, Google, Pfizer and a who’s who of U.S. multinationals that have been able to avoid paying taxes in other jurisdictions and brought billions in tax income to Ireland’s coffers. The Irish government has said that a deal would need to allow small countries to continue to compete with large ones to make up for the loss of any tax advantage. Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said in a statement that Ireland would remain engaged in the negotiations and would seek a “comprehensive, sustainable and equitable agreement.”'\n\n'>> Title: Expelling Diplomats, a Furious Kremlin Escalates a Crisis'\n'>> Article: MOSCOW — Russia on Thursday escalated a confrontation with Europe and the United States over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, saying it would expel 60 American diplomats and an unspecified number of envoys from other countries to retaliate for a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats working in the West and beyond that was ordered this week. Furious at what it described as an anti-Russian campaign orchestrated by Washington and London, the Kremlin exceeded an equivalent response to the United States and ordered the closing of the American Consulate in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city. The consulate is bigger and far more important to relations than the Russian Consulate in Seattle, which the Trump administration ordered closed on Monday as part of its expulsion decree. The crisis over the March 4 poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter has driven tensions between the Kremlin and the West to their highest pitch in decades and forced European countries like Germany that are usually wary of clashing with Moscow to choose sides. Britain contends that the poison used was a signature Russian nerve agent created by Soviet-era scientists. Voicing alarm that the East-West confrontation was spinning out of control, the secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, said that the crisis recalled the Cold War, only without the controls and channels of communication established before the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union “to make sure things would not get out of control when tensions rise.”'\n\n'>> Title: James Corden and the Dangers of Likability'\n'>> Article: It was all just another day on the internet-driven media, where the demands of algorithms lead to celebrity justice meted out on a regular basis. Yet as with many such brouhahas, it provides clues to soft spots in the culture, to the fragilities that were already there. The backdrop is that Corden, who plans on stepping down from his show next year, is part of a late-night landscape that is going through a transition if not a crisis. Not long after he announced he would be leaving, Trevor Noah somewhat abruptly declared he was ending his run on “The Daily Show.” (The latest rumor is he’ll be replaced by a committee of hosts.) Ratings for late-night talk shows have been declining for years. There is a growing sense that such invariably topical programs are a poor fit on streaming services. With the networks fading in relevance, there are also whispers of more dramatic shifts to lineups, including the storied NBC institutions of “The Tonight Show” and “Late Night With Seth Meyers.” We are in a moment when viewers are questioning what we want these shows to be and what makes for a successful host. For some network executives in the past decade, the answer is clearly likability. They have emphasized performers the audience can relate to, a star who, to use the phrase that used to be a political litmus test in the pre-Trump era, you would want to have a beer with. James Corden was that bloke. Often described as seeming to come out of nowhere (otherwise known as England), he presented himself as an ordinary guy, self-deprecating, quick to laugh, eager to please. His signature bit, “Carpool Karaoke,” pulled off the feat of making pop superstars also seem down to earth and relatable, making for charming television and great promotion. Talk-show perfection. Corden is not actually ordinary at all. He is a famous actor and gifted Broadway star. As it happens, he earned the late-night job in no small part because of his Tony-winning performance in the hit play “One Man, Two Guvnors,” and his latest drama could be seen as a callback to that show’s comic high point, where his down-on-his-luck character desperately tries to help an inept waiter. But his talk-show persona, like that of the forever boyish Jimmy Fallon, did not rest on his comic and musical talents, but on how he exploits them to seem like a garden-variety sweetheart.'\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel_checkpoint = \"t5-small\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_checkpoint, model_max_length=512)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-06T11:46:05.283432Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-06T11:46:05.284148Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-06T11:46:10.643980Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-06T11:46:05.284107Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-06T11:46:10.642957Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.17k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"3486258b62c24eff96ab145029586bc3"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/773k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"dc9646c161e94a60bd60d90db03569f1"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Downloading:   0%|          | 0.00/1.32M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"420846d7f9ff4410b3b0eac6720e733d"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#test tokenizer\ninputs = tokenizer(\"MOSCOW — Russia on Thursday escalated a confrontation with Europe and the United States over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, saying it would expel 60 American diplomats and an unspecified number of envoys from other countries to retaliate for a mass expulsion of Russian diplomats working in the West and beyond that was ordered this week.

But he appeared to be referring to a phone call he had days earlier with King Salman. In his remarks here in Bahrain, home to the Navy’s Fifth Fleet, Mr. Mattis sought to tamp down increasing concerns that if Washington reduces its security role in the Middle East, Russia would move quickly to fill the vacuum. The United States has not had an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf since March, and the Pentagon is pulling Patriot missile-defense systems out of Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain as part of a strategic realignment of firepower away from the Middle East and toward Russia and China. “Russia’s presence in the region cannot replace the longstanding, enduring and transparent U.S. commitment to the Middle East,” Mr. Mattis said. Indeed, the bulk of Mr. Mattis’s speech focused on what he said was Iran’s destabilizing actions in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon — “spreading mischief and murder across the region,” as the secretary put it. The speech was likely to be well received in some quarters. “It was what Saudi Arabia and its allies wanted, and are delighted to hear: a reaffirmation of America’s commitment to the region, to its partners and of course to a blanket hostility toward Iran and all Iran does,” said Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf during the Obama administration. When Mr. Mattis served as the four-star general and leader of the military’s Central Command during the Obama administration, he blamed Iran for deadly attacks by Shiite militias in Iraq. He advocated confronting Iran, a position that put him at odds with President Barack Obama, who was trying to engage Iran diplomatically.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def
