0~Metro Briefing | New York: Bronx: Teenager Charged In Murder~A Bronx teenager who the police say stabbed his mother three times in the chest was charged with murder yesterday. The man, Brandon Elliott, 19, was charged in the attack, which occurred Tuesday on East 224th Street in the Williamsbridge section. He lived with his mother, Bridget Johnson, 42. She was taken to Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center, where she died last night, the police said. Tina Kelley (NYT)
0~Texas Blackouts Hit Minority Neighborhoods Especially Hard~SAN ANTONIO, Texas — When the lights went out Monday night in the Alazán-Apache housing project in San Antonio — which stands in one of the city’s poorest ZIP codes — the traffic signals in the neighborhood flickered off and storekeepers pulled down their shutters. For residents, there was little left to do but huddle under blankets and hope that their children wouldn’t fall ill. “I need to take my kids somewhere to keep them warm. I don’t know where,” said Ricardo Cruz, 42, who lives at the Alazán-Apache Courts with his wife and five children, between 5 and 13 years old, and who has been without electricity since 7 p.m. Monday. While the rolling blackouts in Texas have left some 4 million residents without power in brutally cold weather, experts and community groups say that many marginalized communities were the first to be hit with power outages, and if history serves as a guide, could be among the last to be reconnected. This is particularly perilous, they say, given that low-income households can lack the financial resources to flee to safety or to rebound after the disruption.
0~Italy, Mired in Politics Over Virus, Asks How Much Testing Is Too Much~That means that 187 of those who tested positive for the virus exhibited only mild symptoms or none at all. In addition, at least 37 of those who did are now healthy and have been discharged. But other top Italian medical officials warned that while it was possible that asymptomatic people might be less contagious, because, for instance, they cough less, very little is known about the new virus and how it behaves. “Evidence is lacking,” said Giovanni Rezza, the head of epidemiology at the leading scientific organization of Italy’s National Health Service. Lombardy officials said they preferred to know who had the virus. “Either you hide problems under a carpet, or you lift the carpet and you clean the floor,” Attilio Fontana, the region’s president, said in an interview in his office, with views over a foggy and eerily quiet Milan, 29 floors above the virus hunters. Mr. Fontana is a leading member of the League party, led by the nationalist Matteo Salvini, who has not been shy about leveraging the crisis to pursue his aim of bringing down Mr. Conte’s government. Mr. Salvini has argued in recent days that Mr. Conte had fumbled the response to the crisis and needed to be replaced. Mr. Fontana said he disagreed with Mr. Conte’s “way of dealing with the crisis.” The region’s tests were necessary, he argued, suggesting that if other places tested as rigorously, they would find more cases, too. “I don’t exclude that even in your country if they did a serious and attentive epidemiologic analysis they would find more than what the actual infected are,” he said, referring to the United States. Numbers were high in Italy, he added, “because we do a lot of checks.”
0~Where Wearable Technology Ends Up (Hint: Not Your Wrist)~The junk drawer in my home used to look just like yours, filled with loose change, batteries and birthday candles. But over the last year, a new category of junk has started to accumulate there: wearable devices. There’s my old Fitbit, a fitness tracker I used for a couple of weeks, forgot to charge and never wore again. It sits next to a dusty Jawbone UP, another tracker that once told me I had walked three miles while I sat on my couch eating popcorn and watching a movie. And then there’s the Apple Watch, the much-hyped device that was supposed to usher in a new era of mobile computing. Instead, these gadgets are ending up in drawers and closets as expensive reminders of how wearable gadgets are not ready for prime time — at least for the foreseeable future. Like others, I once believed that wearables were going to change the way we live. In much the way that smartphones put the Internet into our pockets, wearable devices were going to place information that much closer to our fingertips, and make us healthier and less dependent on our smartphones.
0~Hezbollah Hits Back at Israeli Army but Without Casualties~JERUSALEM — The Lebanese militia Hezbollah fired missiles at an Israeli military border post on Sunday in what it called payback for an Israeli airstrike a week earlier that killed two Lebanese operatives in Syria and a drone strike that damaged Hezbollah infrastructure in the Beirut suburbs. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel experienced no casualties — “not an injury, not even a scratch.” And while Israel returned fire with attack helicopters and about 100 artillery shells, both sides appeared eager to let the hostilities subside just as quickly as they had begun. Sunday’s abbreviated fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iran-backed military force that dominates politics in Lebanon, comes as Israel is pushing back more assertively, and often openly, against what it sees as Iranian aggression throughout the Middle East. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah has shown much appetite for sustained conflict, but each skirmish contains the potential for escalation.
0~He Abused Her for Years. She Shot Him. France Asks: Is It Self-Defense?~LA SELLE-SUR-LE-BIED, France — Jacqueline Sauvage and Norbert Marot married as teenagers and built their dream house of wood and stone with a big garden and terrace in this village 70 miles south of Paris. On the terrace of that home 47 years later, Ms. Sauvage shot her husband in the back three times with a hunting rifle, killing him, and putting an end to what she said was decades of physical abuse by him. She was found guilty of murder late last year and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Her case has drawn national attention to domestic violence against women in France, and to the inadequacy of France’s institutions in dealing with the problem. But it has also raised an uncomfortable question for France: If your husband abuses you for years and one day you shoot and kill him, is it self-defense?

0~El gobierno de México llama a la calma y adopta medidas mesuradas frente al virus~Sin embargo, para el viernes 13 de marzo en la noche, la cifra de casos confirmados se había disparado. El gobierno federal se vio obligado a tomar acciones más contundentes y los funcionarios de salud instaron a la suspensión de “servicios no esenciales”, incluidos seminarios, clases, foros y otros eventos a pequeña escala que tienen poco impacto económico. El sábado se anunciaron más medidas. El juego entre Pumas y Cruz Azul —uno de varios partidos de futbol profesional que se llevaron a cabo la noche del viernes y el sábado en estadios abarrotados en todo México— también fue uno de los últimos. El sábado por la tarde, mientras los equipos femeniles jugaban ante un público de más de 22.000 aficionados, las autoridades anunciaron que el resto de los partidos de liga a celebrarse el fin de semana se iban a jugar con estadios vacíos. Entre ellos había un partido muy esperado entre rivales de Ciudad de México, el Club América y el Cruz Azul, el cual se iba a disputar en el cavernoso Estadio Azteca. El domingo, la liga anunció que iba a suspender la temporada después del partido entre el América y el Cruz Azul del domingo por la noche.
0~North Korea Dropped Out of Meeting With Pence at Last Minute, U.S. Says~WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence had planned to secretly meet with a high-level delegation of North Korean leaders while he was at the Winter Olympics in South Korea this month, but the North Koreans canceled at the last minute, according to the State Department. “We regret the failure to seize this opportunity,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said Tuesday. The canceled meeting is the latest twist in the evolving American strategy to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programs, which Western intelligence agencies say will soon be able to threaten the continental United States. It also adds a remarkable coda to the strange tableau during the opening ceremony of Mr. Pence sitting in a reviewing stand less than 10 feet away from Kim Yo-jong, the sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as the two stared fixedly ahead without acknowledging each other.
0~Climate-Bill Advocates Back Off Cap-and-Trade Effort~WASHINGTON  As they watch President Obama’s ambitious health care plan crumble, the advocates of a comprehensive bill to combat global warming are turning their sights to a more modest package of climate and energy measures that they believe has a better chance of clearing Congress this year. Their preferred approach, a cap-and-trade system to curb emissions of climate-changing gases, already faced a difficult road in a bruised and divided Senate. Its prospects grew dimmer after the special election in Massachusetts last week was won by Scott Brown, a Republican who repudiated the federal cap-and-trade proposal in his campaign. Republicans, industry executives and some Democrats have already written cap and trade’s obituary, at least for this year. And even some of the system’s most ardent supporters now say they must scale back their ambitions and focus on job-creating energy projects and energy efficiency measures if they are to have any hope of dealing with climate change in this Congress. “Realistically, the cap-and-trade bills in the House and the Senate are going nowhere,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is trying to fashion a bipartisan package of climate and energy measures. “They’re not business-friendly enough, and they don’t lead to meaningful energy independence.”
0~Businesses are whipsawed again as the Supreme Court blocks OSHA’s vaccine mandate.~Some companies have been concerned about losing employees when workers are already scarce, and although firms with mandates have said those concerns have largely not come to fruition, a national requirement could have further eased those concerns. The National Retail Federation, which was one of several trade groups to sue the administration over the mandate, called the Supreme Court’s action a “significant victory for employers.” The organization said it “urges the Biden administration to discard this unlawful mandate and instead work with employers, employees and public health experts on practical ways to increase vaccination rates and mitigate the spread of the virus in 2022.” Companies have been preparing for months for the mandate, and many may still go forward with their policies, said Douglas Brayley, an employment lawyer at Ropes & Gray. He noted that the Supreme Court did not say anything against employer vaccination mandates. Some local and state laws still require employers to mandate vaccines or weekly testing. New York City, for example, has a more stringent rule than the federal government’s, requiring all on-site workers to be vaccinated. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld state vaccine mandates, and it did not limit the ability of employers to create their own requirements. But other states have laws blocking mask and vaccine mandates, which the federal rule would have pre-empted. With the Biden administration’s rule blocked, many employers in those states will be unable to require vaccines, said David Michaels, an epidemiologist and a professor at George Washington University and a former OSHA administrator. “This decision will be an excuse for those employers who care less about their employees to return to business as usual,” Dr. Michaels said. He added that the decision could exacerbate the divide between white-collar workers who can remain at home and workers who have to conduct business in person as Covid cases surge. The Supreme Court’s decision, which described OSHA’s rule as “a blunt instrument,” left open the possibility that the agency could issue a revised rule that is targeted at certain types of workplaces or is more clearly within its purview, such as requiring improved ventilation and personal protective equipment, Dr. Michaels said. It could also follow a more traditional rule-making process rather than the emergency one it used, though that could take years.
0~Trump Administration Threatens to Cut U.S. Highway Funds From California~Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter. WASHINGTON — The political war between California and the Trump administration escalated Monday with a letter from Andrew Wheeler, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, warning that Washington would withhold federal highway funds from the state if it did not rapidly address a decades-long backlog of state-level pollution control plans. The letter is the latest parry between President Trump and the liberal West Coast state that he appears to relish antagonizing. California’s recent actions on clean air and climate change policy have blindsided and enraged him, according to two people familiar with the matter. While California has angered Mr. Trump with its efforts to adhere to stricter state standards on climate change pollution from vehicles even as Mr. Trump has sought to roll back such standards nationally, Mr. Wheeler’s new letter to the state offers a twist on the narrative. It states that California “has the worst air quality in the United States,” including 82 areas within the state with air quality that does not meet federal law. It says that by law, the state is required to submit plans for reducing that pollution, but that California has a backlog of about 130 incomplete or inactive plans, “many dating back decades.”
0~‘They Cannot Remove Me by Force’: A Strongman on Afghan Infighting~Here are excerpts from the interview, translated from Dari: On rumors of a deal to leave the governorship: I have not received any messages about that. I spoke with the president twice in detail. We talked about bringing changes, but I also told him this: that I did not inherit this province so that I should be its governor forever. I gave an example that if still water is left in one place too long, it will start to stink. But I also told him, “I don’t want to be a victim of your campaign slogans.” On the government’s legitimacy and stability: A legitimate government is one that is formed as a result of free and fair elections, as the result of the blue-inked fingers of the people. You know that this presidential election was the worst, the longest and the most fraudulent election in the world. Instead, the government was created on a political agreement. It only has legitimacy because of that political agreement and by the signature of our team. That agreement is just for two years alone, until four months from now. Meanwhile, they have just made a mockery of the government and the people’s vote and will. ... Although our team is in government, unfortunately they don’t listen to us. The political agreement of the N.U.G. is not being implemented, unfortunately. Except for the formation of the cabinet, nothing else mentioned in the N.U.G. agreement is in effect yet. Dr. Abdullah is not involved in the big, strategic, national decision making. ... I would never wish for the collapse of this government. No matter how weak it may be, it is still better than not having a government at all. That would be very dangerous. Our people would experience the past decades again. No one wants a repeat of those chaotic decades. On the violence between Mr. Atta’s and General Dostum’s men: It was a conspiracy to disrupt peace in this city. I don’t want to boast about my achievements, but this is the only province in the country that is doing great in terms of security, development, reconstruction and so on. They could not accept this and want to ruin it. ... Supporters of General Dostum tried to come here from his strongholds. They were trying to come into this province with tanks, Humvees, and guns and ammunition from other provinces, but I turned them around at the border gates. It was my order to stop them. They repeatedly said that was undemocratic, but I told them it is not democratic to bring people from other provinces to cause violence. What has democracy to do with mortars or tanks? They got all these tanks from General Dostum’s palace in Sheberghan — that is where they got them from. Obviously, some of the Afghan national security force units obey the vice president’s orders. But we prevented this agitation from reaching Mazar-i-Sharif.
0~Turning Away From Nursing Homes, to What?~Covid-19 had taken the lives of 181,000 people in U.S. nursing homes, assisted living and other long-term care facilities through last weekend, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation — 33 percent of the national toll. All types of nursing homes, no matter their quality, have been hit, according to an investigation of Medicare’s rating system by The New York Times. The troubles have intensified a spotlight on long-running questions about how communities can do a better job supporting people who need care but want to live outside an institutional setting. Becoming more age-friendly Demand for such care has declined sharply during the pandemic. The occupancy rate in nursing homes in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 75 percent, down 11 percentage points from the first quarter, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, a research group. The reduced demand was tied to Covid-19, deaths from the virus and a steep decline in elective surgery that requires follow-up care in a skilled nursing facility, according to the group’s research. “We’ve been seeing increasing levels of calls to our member agencies and other community aging providers from people who have Mom or Dad in a nursing home or an assisted living facility, and now they want to get them out and bring them home,” said Sandy Markwood, chief executive officer of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. The shift may not be permanent, but this much is clear: As the aging of the nation accelerates, most communities need to do much more to become age-friendly, said Jennifer Molinsky, senior research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard.
0~Breeze, Avelo: Two New U.S. Airlines Launching in 2021~A year after the pandemic’s arrival, U.S. passenger air travel remains at roughly half its pre-Covid levels and may not fully bounce back anytime soon. Is this really the time to launch a new domestic airline? How about two new airlines? A couple of industry veterans-turned-entrepreneurs think so. Look for flights from the low-fare carriers Avelo Airlines and Breeze Airways soon. Andrew Levy, the former president of the budget carrier Allegiant Airlines, purchased the charter airline XTRA Airways in 2018. He renamed the company Avelo and planned to turn it into a low-fare, customer-focused airline with scheduled service from smaller airports that serve large metro areas. The official start of the Houston-based airline will happen in early April, and in the meantime, the company is keeping flight destinations under wraps as they get finalized. Mr. Levy had hoped for the company’s first flights to take off in November 2020 but the pandemic forced the airline to slow things down. Now though, Mr. Levy feels there are a number of factors coming together to make this spring the right time to launch. The major airlines have reduced their numbers of flights, so there is airplane gate and office capacity at airports that had previously been constrained, he said. It’s also a good time to hire flight crews and other experienced airline staff, he added, because many of the big airlines have laid off employees or offered early retirement packages.
0~One Candidate, 2 or 3 Ballot Lines: Bid to Alter Practice Stirs Debate~ALBANY — Among the thicket of proposals being floated to combat Albany’s chronic corruption problem, there is one that seems fairly straightforward: to repeal the Wilson-Pakula Act of 1947, which gives the leaders of political parties the power to anoint nonparty members who want to run on their ballot lines. It is a practice that dovetails with New York State’s unique and antique “fusion voting” system, a vestige of 19th-century elections which has been banned by many other states, which allows candidates to run — and collect votes — on multiple party lines. Over the years, it has been used by some of the state’s smallest political parties to endorse major-party candidates in exchange for consideration of their political goals. Or, as critics allege, sometimes just for money. But several small parties argue that the proposed changes could marginalize their groups — and their political views, a position held by Mike Long, the chairman of the state’s Conservative Party. “Wilson-Pakula didn’t commit the crime, and the fusion system didn’t promote the crime,” Mr. Long said. “You can put us out of business and do away with fusion voting and you’re still going to have to deal with individuals who want to game the system.”
0~Israeli Law Declares the Country the ‘Nation-State of the Jewish People’~JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has long demanded that the Palestinians acknowledge his country’s existence as the “nation-state of the Jewish people.” On Thursday, his governing coalition stopped waiting around and pushed through a law that made it a fact. In an incendiary move hailed as historic by Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition but denounced by centrists and leftists as racist and anti-democratic, Israel’s Parliament enacted a law that enshrines the right of national self-determination as “unique to the Jewish people” — not all citizens. The legislation, a “basic law” — giving it the weight of a constitutional amendment — omits any mention of democracy or the principle of equality, in what critics called a betrayal of Israel’s 1948 Declaration of Independence, which ensured “complete equality of social and political rights” for “all its inhabitants” no matter their religion, race or sex. The new law promotes the development of Jewish communities, possibly aiding those who would seek to advance discriminatory land-allocation policies. And it downgrades Arabic from an official language to one with a “special status.”
0~Brian May’s Flooded Basement Foretells a Climate Under Pressure~The problem, Professor Travers said, is that London’s weather is usually so moderate and predictable that no single weather episode, however damaging, is likely to galvanize politicians into taking major action to climate-proof the city. Alarmist reactions to bad weather are a well-worn London tradition: Heat waves bring warnings of buckled railroad tracks; a light coating of snow paralyzes the streets. But they tend to wash away with the return of clouds and drizzle. Even if there was a climate reckoning, the most obvious remedy — rebuilding London’s Victorian-era sewage system, which was built to serve a city less than half the size it is today — would be prohibitively expensive. The city is currently digging a giant tunnel system, the Thames Tideway, to carry sewage that flows into the river when it rains. The cost of that alone is nearly $7 billion. “There’s no question that this Victorian infrastructure is not capable of handling that much water,” said Roger Burrows, a professor of cities at Newcastle University. “Poor Brian May’s basement is merely an example of that.” Professor Burrows, who has written about the proliferation of megabasements in London, said it was a stretch to blame them for overflowing sewers. After all, the city already sits on a vast amount of excavated underground space, most recently the Elizabeth line, a new 60-mile railway that currently connects Paddington Station and Liverpool Street Station and will ultimately link Heathrow Airport in the west with Essex in the east.
0~Asia Welcomes Travelers, but Japan Says, Not Yet~The fact is Japan has had much more success fighting the pandemic than virtually all other wealthy nations, managing to keep infection numbers and overall death rates comparatively low without resorting to the hard lockdowns seen in some other countries. Even at the height of the pandemic this past February, daily case counts only once exceeded 100,000. Even as the United States and much of Europe battled the Delta and Omicron waves with more restrictions, life in Japan — with the exception of near ubiquitous masking — was proceeding more or less as normal, with people dining out, shopping, attending live music and sporting events and traveling to many of the country’s popular destination spots, including those featured in the Tourism Organization’s new website. It’s unclear what accounts for Japan’s success in fighting the virus. Most experts credit the public’s embrace of public health recommendations along with high vaccination rates — nearly 80 percent of the population has received at least two shots and more than 40 percent have three. But other, sometimes eccentric, theories have also been tossed around, ranging from Japan’s preference for bowing over handshakes to hardier genetics. Whatever the real reason, the public perception is that the restrictions on foreigners have been highly effective. (Most people ignore the inconvenient fact that Japanese nationals have been able to leave and enter the country as they please.) Of course, not everyone supports keeping the country closed to tourists. The restrictions have crushed some local economies that have come to rely on guests from China, South Korea and more distant locales. Ski resorts in the Japanese Alps, spa towns in Kyushu and tropical islands far-off the beaten path have all found themselves in dire financial straits. Shutting down the country’s tourism industry likely cost Japan at least $90 billion in 2020 alone, according to one study by a professor at Kansai University. But even in a city like Kyoto, which is highly dependent on tourists dollars, some locals have been happy to have a breather from the crush of bus tours that clogged the streets and most famous destinations in the years before the pandemic.
0~A Saudi Morals Enforcer Called for a More Liberal Islam. Then the Death Threats Began.~I even dropped by the Commission’s headquarters, a boxy, steel-and-glass building on a Riyadh highway between a gas station and a car dealership. Its website advertised open hours with the director, so I went to his office, through halls filled with bearded men milling about and slick banners proclaiming “A Policy of Excellence” and “Together Against Corruption.” “He didn’t come today,” the director’s secretary told me. “Maybe next week.” On my way out, two men invited me into an office and served me coffee. “How do you like working for the Commission?” I asked. “Everyone who chooses this job loves it,” one said. It was the work of “the entire Islamic nation,” and it felt good “to bring people from the darkness into the light.” The other man had been on the force for 15 years and said he preferred working in the office. “You rest more in the administration,” he said. “Out there we have problems with people. They call us the religious police. Criminals! Thieves! You never get to rest out in the field.” A scowling man appeared in the doorway and told me that I was not allowed to talk to anyone. The first man soon left. The second offered me more coffee, then tea, then forced me to take a bottle of water when I left. Reform, the Hard Way The first irony of Mr. Ghamdi’s situation is that many Saudis, including members of the royal family and even important clerics, agree with him, although mostly in private. And public mixing of the sexes in some places — hospitals, conferences and in Mecca during the pilgrimage — is common. In some Saudi cities it is not uncommon to see women’s faces, or even their hair. But there is a split in society between the conservatives who want to maintain what they consider the kingdom’s pure Islamic identity and the liberals (in the Saudi context) who want more personal freedoms. Liberals make cases like Mr. Ghamdi’s all the time. But sheikhs don’t, which is why he was branded a traitor.
0~Scotland Rejects Independence From United Kingdom~EDINBURGH — Voters in Scotland rejected independence from Britain in a referendum that had threatened to break up the 307-year union between them, according to projections by the BBC and Sky News early Friday. Before dawn after a night of counting that showed a steady trend in favor of maintaining the union, Nicola Sturgeon, the deputy head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, effectively conceded defeat for the “yes” campaign that had pressed for secession. “Like thousands of others across the country I’ve put my heart and soul into this campaign and there is a real sense of disappointment that we’ve fallen narrowly short of securing a yes vote,” Ms. Sturgeon told BBC television. With 26 of 32 voting districts reporting, there were 1,397,077 votes, or 54.2 percent, against independence, and 1,176,952, or 45.7 percent, in favor.
0~Carmakers’ Close Ties to Regulator Scrutinized~There was nothing unusual about a letter with Jacqueline S. Glassman’s name on it discussing life-threatening safety defects and requiring more information from a manufacturer; Ms. Glassman was once chief counsel of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, then deputy administrator, and, briefly, acting administrator. But the letter this month was not from her, it was to her. Ms. Glassman left the agency in 2006 to join a top law firm, and her clients include Graco Children’s Products, which is refusing to recall almost 1.8 million child restraints that the safety agency says pose a hazard to infants. The letter to Ms. Glassman was demanding information about that refusal. Ms. Glassman is now a partner at Hogan Lovells, where her expertise is described as including counseling on “responding to government investigations.” She is among many former top N.H.T.S.A. officials who now represent companies they were once responsible for regulating, part of a well-established migration from regulator to the regulated in Washington.

0~Long Treated as a Joke, Brazilian Neofascist May Have the Last Laugh~For years, he was written off as an eccentric fringe candidate, a neofascist oddity, a crackpot even. But Enéas Ferreira Carneiro got his revenge in the general election this month, when more than 1.5 million people here in Brazil's largest state voted for him, giving him more votes than any other congressional candidate in Brazilian history. That result has caused consternation and indignation among the country's political elite. A leading political columnist described his record as a ''barbarity,'' and elected officials are renewing calls for an overhaul of the voting system to prevent ''the Enéas phenomenon'' from ever happening again. But Dr. Carneiro, a 63-year-old cardiologist who founded the Party for the Rebuilding of the National Order in 1989, says his critics are missing the point. ''The electorate supported me as a clear, resounding and unmistakable repudiation of a political class that is rotten, dirty, repugnant and unpatriotic,'' he said in an interview at his party's headquarters here. With his dark ZZ Top beard, bald head, oversize owlish glasses, florid vocabulary and dramatic pronunciation, Dr. Carneiro is instantly recognizable to Brazilians and traditionally regarded with a certain perplexed amusement. An Enéas look-a-like was featured in commercials for a brand of steel wool until Dr. Carneiro sued to stop it, but he remains the constant butt of jokes on television variety and comedy programs.
0~Merck Says Its Covid Pill Is Less Effective in a Final Analysis~The pharmaceutical company Merck said on Friday that in a final analysis of a clinical trial, its antiviral pill reduced the risk of hospitalization and death among high-risk Covid patients by 30 percent, down from an earlier estimate of 50 percent. The lower efficacy is a disappointment for the drug, known as molnupiravir, which health officials around the world are counting on as a critical tool to save lives and reduce the burden on hospitals. It increases the importance of a similar, apparently more effective, offering from Pfizer that is also under review by the Food and Drug Administration. A panel of advisers to the F.D.A. is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss Merck’s treatment and vote on whether to recommend authorizing it to treat high-risk Covid patients. In briefing documents posted to the F.D.A.’s website on Friday, agency reviewers did not take a position on whether the drug should be authorized, though they found that the clinical trial data did not show any major safety concerns and that the drug was effective in preventing severe disease.
0~Saudis Face Mounting Pressure Over Civilian Deaths in Yemen Conflict~CAIRO — Saudi Arabia and its allies faced mounting international pressure on Tuesday to halt a bombing campaign in Yemen the day after airstrikes killed dozens of people at a village wedding on the Red Sea coast. The attack occurred Monday morning in the village of Wahija, south of the city of Mokha, and appeared to be one of the deadliest involving civilians since the military campaign began in March. Witnesses said Monday that at least 70 people had been killed in tents set up for the wedding. On Tuesday, two local medical officials said as many as 81 people had died. The attack on the wedding, along with a string of recent airstrikes that have led to large numbers of civilian deaths, has fueled accusations that the Saudi-led military coalition is conducting an increasingly reckless offensive as it tries to defeat the Houthis, a rebel movement from the north of Yemen. The strikes have prompted a series of unusually angry statements from normally cautious United Nations officials who have singled out the coalition for causing the majority of civilian deaths in Yemen’s six-month war. There have also been signs that the Obama administration could face more questions over its military support of the air campaign. On Tuesday, Representative Ted W. Lieu, Democrat of California, sent the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff a letter citing reports of civilian deaths and requesting that the United States “cease aiding coalition airstrikes in Yemen until the coalition demonstrates that they will institute proper safeguards to prevent civilian deaths.”
0~OPEC and Russia Aim to Raise Oil Prices With Supply Cut~At a news conference after the meeting, the Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said OPEC Plus was acting amid signs of a downturn in the world economy that might cause demand for oil to weaken and prices to fall. “We would rather be pre-emptive than be sorry,” he said. The move appeared to have the desired result: The price of Brent crude, the international benchmark, which had slumped during the summer, rose more than 1.5 percent after the meeting, extending the gains recorded in recent days and bringing prices back to levels last seen in mid-September. The average price of gasoline in the United States recently began to rise again, tracking the price of oil. In response to the OPEC Plus announcement, Biden administration officials said the president would order the Energy Department to release 10 million additional barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in November. Earlier this week, the administration said it had no plans to extend a six-month effort to release one million barrels a day, which was scheduled to finish at the end of this month. Hours before the OPEC Plus meeting, the European Union pushed ahead with an ambitious plan promoted by the Biden administration to cap the price of Russian oil, in coordination with Group of 7 nations and others. The European Union cap is intended to set the price of Russian oil lower than where it is today but still above the cost of producing it. The U.S. Treasury Department estimates that the program could deprive the Kremlin of tens of billions of dollars annually. But some analysts say the cap would make the logistics of the oil trade more difficult, driving prices higher. And it relies on the participation of non-E.U. nations that are still buying Russian oil.
0~Coalition Leader in State Senate Accused of Sexual Misconduct~ALBANY — The leader of a powerful group of renegade Democrats in the New York State Senate has been accused by a former staff member of forcibly kissing her outside an Albany bar in 2015. The allegation surfaced in a HuffPost article on Wednesday, just minutes after the senator, Jeffrey D. Klein, held an extraordinary conference call with reporters to pre-emptively deny the accusation. Mr. Klein then released an investigative memorandum by his lawyers asserting that the former staff member had been drinking and behaving unusually that evening. The woman, Erica Vladimer, told HuffPost that Mr. Klein had kissed her against her will while the two were having a celebratory post-budget cigarette outside Justin’s bar in downtown Albany with other staff members and lawmakers. “All of a sudden there was a hand on the back of my head and he shoved his tongue down my throat,” Ms. Vladimer, 30, told HuffPost. “In my head it lasted forever, I don’t think it lasted even three seconds.”
0~The New York Times~“Wow, what a tournament we witnessed this week, Johnny Mac! Before we came back on the air, we were both saying that we’ve been just flat-out blown away by the talent at this year’s Intertemporal Tennis Writers Classic. Some of the greatest writers in history came and competed and showed us what it means to write extraordinarily well about tennis. This tournament attracts the world’s sharpest minds because tennis is a global sport that’s steeped in tradition, and more, it’s a gentlemanly clash of wills where you’re out there alone, and the way you play reveals so much about who you are. Somewhere between chess and boxing lies tennis. So you have to be an elite writer to get through this tournament. That’s why no one was surprised to see Touré get knocked out in the first round. Sure, he’s done some nice stories, like his profile of Jennifer Capriati for Vogue, in which he hits with her. Do we have a clip from that? ‘The whole incident takes on the feel of intense aerobics mixed with a back-alley mugging, and you’re just deflecting and defending and, eventually, after eight or nine minutes, your arm starts to throb and your lungs start to shriek and each new shot racing at you is like a punch to the chest and you feel her inner bully.’ Touré’s a solid player, but in this tournament your forehand is your vocabulary, your backhand is your eye for detail, your ability to turn words into poetry and rhythm is your volley, your use of metaphors and symbolism is your overhead, and your deep understanding of the sport is your all-important first serve. Touré writes passionately and knows tennis, but some whispered that he might have gotten into the tournament only because of affirmative action. Maybe. “Mac, at this year’s tournament, to get into the semi­finals your writing had to be beyond incredible. Some excellent people went down in the quarters — the novelist Barry Hannah, the sportswriter Frank Deford, the incomparable Neil Amdur and the unforgettable Red Smith, for whom the award for sportswriting is named! But it’s a little understandable when you look at who was in the semis. On one side we had the No. 2 seed, John McPhee, against the wild card Vladimir Nabokov. On the other we saw the eighth seed, Martin Amis, against the No. 1 seed, David Foster Wallace. “McPhee wrote one of the best books on tennis ever, ‘Levels of the Game,’ about the 1968 U.S. Open semi­finals, in which Arthur Ashe defeated Clark Graebner. Here’s a clip: ‘A person’s tennis game begins with his nature and background and comes out through his motor mechanisms into shot patterns and characteristics of play. If he is deliberate, he is a deliberate tennis player; and if he is flamboyant, his game probably is, too. A tight, close match unmarred by error and representative of each player’s game at its highest level will be primarily a psychological struggle.’ The book takes us inside the players’ minds and is filled with lush, rhythmic language. McPhee explores the sociopolitical undercurrents that run through the match, which takes place at an epic moment in tennis history — when pros were finally allowed to play alongside amateurs in the majors, the start of the open era, the dawn of the modern age. ‘Levels of the Game’ is an exceptional and timeless work. So it was a total shock when McPhee, despite writing a great book, lost in the semis to someone who had done just a few pages on tennis. But then again, those pages are spectacular. “John, ‘Lolita’ is considered by some to be the greatest novel of the last century. Midway through the story, as Humbert Humbert and Dolores Haze are traveling across America, they stop to play tennis on courts by a motel. What emerges is some of the most delectable writing ever about the sport. Let’s go to the videotape: ‘My Lolita had a way of raising her bent left knee at the ample and springy start of the service cycle when there would develop and hang in the sun for a second a vital web of balance between toed foot, pristine armpit, burnished arm and far back-flung racket, as she smiled up with gleaming teeth at the small globe suspended so high in the zenith of the powerful and graceful cosmos she had created for the express purpose of falling upon it with a clean resounding crack of her golden whip. It had, that serve of hers, beauty, directness, youth, a classical purity of trajectory, and was, despite its spanking pace, fairly easy to return, having as it did no twist or sting to its long elegant hop.’ There you see imaginative descriptions of tennis’s small moments, twisted comedy and story-enriching symbolism that tells us more about Humbert, the panting predator, and Dolores, the trapped bird. The girl’s strokes appear lovely because he sees her as the most beautiful thing in the world, but those strokes are ineffectual because her wings have been clipped. Gruesomely. It’s some of the finest writing of the century — it just happens to be about tennis. But who would Nabokov and his few marvelous pages face in the finals?
0~Mastriano’s Sputtering Campaign: No TV Ads, Tiny Crowds, Little Money~HARRISBURG, Pa. — In the same spot where he spoke to thousands of people at a raucous State Capitol rally demanding an end to pandemic restrictions in April 2020, Doug Mastriano appeared on Saturday before a crowd of just a few dozen — about half of whom were volunteers for his ragtag campaign for governor of Pennsylvania. Mr. Mastriano, an insurgent state senator who in the spring cruised to the Republican nomination, is learning this fall that while it is one thing to win a crowded G.O.P. primary on the back of online fame and Donald J. Trump’s endorsement, it is quite another to prevail in a general election in a battleground state of nearly 13 million people. He is being heavily outspent by his Democratic rival, has had no television ads on the air since May, has chosen not to interact with the state’s news media in ways that would push his agenda, and trails by double digits in reputable public polling and most private surveys. There’s no sign of cavalry coming to his aid, either: The Republican Governors Association, which is helping the party’s nominees in Arizona, Michigan and six other states, has no current plans to assist Mr. Mastriano, according to people with knowledge of its deliberations.
0~A Price Tag on Carbon as a Climate Rescue Plan~Yet in the decade it has been used to tackle global warming, this approach has had a turbulent history. The world’s largest such system, in Europe, has had severe problems, including gyrations in the prices that polluters have to pay. Given a lack of evidence that the system can actually solve the emissions problem, some environmental groups and scientists have developed serious reservations. “The reason I don’t support what we’re doing is not that I don’t think something needs to be done,” said Myles R. Allen, a leading British climate scientist at Oxford University. “I just don’t think it’s effective, and I don’t see it ever being effective.” Drought-plagued California, which Gov. Jerry Brown recently called the “epicenter” of climate change, hopes to prove that capitalism can work in the fight against global warming. The state took great care in setting up its system, which is now being seen as a global test case. Eighteen months into the venture, it is still too soon to tell how well it will work. But the state has so far managed to avoid some of the mistakes that have plagued efforts in other parts of the world. Hundreds of industrial facilities have been brought under the plan, prompting those businesses to study how to use less energy, and fuel suppliers will be pulled into it next year. By the end of the decade, the state is expected to collect about $5 billion a year in permit fees, with the bulk of the money being recycled into clean-energy projects. Worldwide, other approaches to global warming are also being considered. A more ambitious push could be made on renewable energy, like solar and wind. Power companies might be ordered to capture their carbon emissions and bury them underground. Forests could be preserved or allowed to regrow to absorb more carbon dioxide from the air.
0~Beirut’s Nightlife Survived Civil War. Can It Withstand Pandemic?~“When you live in a place where nothing is stable and the ground is shaking under you all the time, you live in a state of urgency,” said Charbel Haber, 41, a musician, giving the usual explanation for why the nights here can go on for days. “You have to live in the moment.” Beirutis have few spaces to share. Parks are scarce, and Mediterranean beaches are swallowed by private resorts. It is in the seaside cafes, the restaurants, the hookah spots and the sidewalks of the drinking districts on a Friday night — and, at 5, 6 or 7 the morning after, in the nightclubs — that city life whirls on. Or used to. The truth is, Beirut has not been itself for many months, slowly asphyxiating as the currency plunges in value, banks withhold depositors’ own savings and the government goes hat in hand to international donors. But nightlife survived the summer of 2006, when war erupted between Hezbollah and Israel. And it went on last fall, when more than a million people, about a quarter of the population, surged into the streets in countrywide antigovernment protests as the economy crumpled. At first, many bars and clubs closed in solidarity with the thawra (Arabic for revolution), urging customers to demonstrate. But then they discovered that revolutionary energy was good for business. Crowds of protesters fizzed into nearby bars every evening to refuel, shouting antigovernment slogans on the street, negronis and beers in their hands. When they returned to the demonstrations a few drinks later, they danced to local D.J.s. The protest hub in downtown Beirut thudded with music from a half-dozen different stages as if to compete with the city’s famous nightclubs. At the actual clubs, revolutionary chants sounded between techno beats.
0~Egyptian Court Sentences Ousted President Morsi to Death~CAIRO — An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced to death the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, along with more than 100 others, for fleeing prison during the 2011 revolt against President Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Morsi’s conviction is the latest sign of the undoing of the uprising that overthrew Mr. Mubarak. Mr. Morsi, who was Egypt’s first freely elected leader, now faces the death penalty for escaping extralegal detention — a form of detention that many Egyptians hoped would be eliminated by the revolution. If carried out, the sentence could make Mr. Morsi a martyr to millions of Islamists in Egypt and around the world. In a statement about the sentencing, Amr Darrag, a Muslim Brotherhood leader who was a cabinet minister under Mr. Morsi, said it was “one of the darkest days of Egyptian history” and a symbol “of the dark shadow of authoritarianism that is now cast back over Egypt.” Judge Shaaban el-Shami issued the ruling in a courtroom in a converted auditorium on the grounds of a police academy on the outskirts of Cairo. Mr. Morsi, wearing a blue prison uniform, stood inside a metal and glass cage built in the courtroom. Some of his co-defendants, including other senior Brotherhood leaders, also appeared in the cage.
0~Hillary Clinton Ad Spreads ‘a Little Hope and Love’~With the political rhetoric on both sides of the presidential contest reaching new levels of vitriol, Hillary Clinton’s campaign has released a new ad ahead of Tuesday’s primaries seeking to sow “a little hope and love now.” On Screen The voice of Andra Day rises from a chorus without instrumental backing, setting the tone for the 60-second spot: “Spread a little hope and love now.” Scenes from the Clinton campaign flicker in and out of focus: the candidate doling out high-fives, striding toward a stage, and supporters looking pensive at her events. Big block text with broad platitudes overlay the scenery, calling to “break down barriers.” Ms. Day continues with the second part of the chorus: “We’ll walk it out together.” Mrs. Clinton is shown with Geneva Reed-Veal, the mother of Sandra Bland, who was found hanged in a Texas jail cell after a routine traffic stop last year, and Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia.
0~As Scrutiny of Cryptocurrency Grows, the Industry Turns to K Street~WASHINGTON — When federal regulators late last year accused one of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency platforms of illegally selling $1.38 billion worth of digital money to investors, it was a pivotal moment in efforts to crack down on a fast-growing market — and in the still-nascent industry’s willingness to dive deeply into the Washington influence game. The company, Ripple Labs, has enlisted lobbyists, lawyers and other well-connected advocates to make its case to the Securities and Exchange Commission and beyond in one of the first big legal battles over what limits and requirements the government should set for trading and using digital currency. Ripple has hired two lobbying firms in the past three months. It has retained a consulting firm staffed with former aides to both Hillary Clinton and former President Donald J. Trump to help it develop strategy in Washington. And to defend itself against the S.E.C., it hired Mary Jo White, a former chairwoman of the commission during the Obama administration. Ripple is just one of a long list of cryptocurrency companies scrambling for influence in Washington as the Biden administration begins setting policy that could shape the course of a potentially revolutionary industry that is rapidly moving into the mainstream and drawing intensifying attention from financial regulators, law enforcement officials and lawmakers.
0~Covid Updates: Pfizer Says Its Antiviral Pill Is Highly Effective~Video The festival of lights, one of the country’s major holidays, seemed to be back in full as India reported its lowest number of daily coronavirus cases since February. Credit Credit... Rajesh Kumar Singh/Associated Press When a devastating second wave of coronavirus infections hit India in the spring, hospitals were overwhelmed with sick patients and crematories struggled to bury the dead as the bodies piled up. Now India is celebrating one its most important holidays — Diwali, the festival of lights — and many fear another wave of infections as millions gather for the celebrations. “We let our guard down on this Diwali,” said Dr. Thekkekara Jacob John, a former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. “Despite government and health experts’ warnings, people think the virus is gone — it is not.” The holiday began on Thursday, and there is no data yet on what impact the festivities might be having on the country’s battle to curb the spread of the virus. But epidemiologists said that they already had concerns. People have been thronging markets with little social distancing, and hundreds of thousands traveled around the country this week to celebrate the holiday with their family members. “For this Diwali, people almost forgot the virus is still here and killing people,” said Dr. Prakash Singh, a virologist in New Delhi, India’s capital. Last year’s festival was observed without the usual fanfare of group prayers and fireworks. Then, the authorities deployed police officers in residential areas to restrict large gatherings. Hundreds of people in New Delhi were fined for breaching coronavirus restrictions. Before this year’s gatherings, health officials in India had already been warning of a possible third wave of infections, even though the second wave has at best only leveled off. A relaxed attitude — combined with the holiday festivities — could hamper the country’s fight against the virus, they said. During the second wave in the spring, the country experienced one of the world’s worst coronavirus surges, reaching a tragic peak in early May of more than 400,000 cases reported per day, with 4,500 daily deaths. But as vaccinations picked up after a slow and chaotic initial rollout, India saw cases plummet. More than three out of four adults have now received at least one vaccine shot, according to government data. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government recently lifted an eight-month ban on vaccine exports. More than 680,000 people flew from airports across the country on Monday in the lead-up to the festival, government officials said. The surge in travel was an apparent sign of confidence in the country’s inoculation campaign, with 54 percent of the population having received at least one shot and 25 percent having been fully inoculated, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. During a strict lockdown from late March to late May last year, most of India’s Covid-19 cases were concentrated in urban areas. But as restrictions on interstate travel were eased, many people started moving from the cities to rural areas, bringing the virus with them. That is what experts fear might happen this time. On Friday, a throat-burning cloud settled over New Delhi, swallowing national monuments, as the air quality deteriorated to the “severe” category a day after Diwali. Despite a government ban, people had celebrated the holiday by setting off fireworks. Amit Tandon, a businessman in the northern Indian city of Chandigarh whose wife died during the second wave of infections in April, said that he was pained by the scenes of people celebrating the holiday while ignoring health restrictions. “When I saw people mixing together without masks and bursting firecrackers, my blood boiled,” he said. “Only those who lost their loved ones know how this disease can destroy families and lives.”
0~What Could a Domestic Terrorism Law Do?~WASHINGTON — The mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso on Saturday and arrest of a man whose white supremacist manifesto railed against a “Hispanic invasion of Texas” have heightened calls for Congress to enact a federal domestic terrorism law. In a statement on Tuesday, the president of the F.B.I. Agents Association, Brian O’Hare, urged Congress “to make domestic terrorism a federal crime. This would ensure that F.B.I. agents and prosecutors have the best tools to fight domestic terrorism.” It is not clear, however, whether such a statute would make a practical difference in what the government can already do under existing law. Some civil libertarians have argued that any legislation that could survive a constitutional challenge would be more about sending a symbolic message than creating major and substantive new government powers. “These proposals tend either to be duplicative of laws that already exist or expansive in ways that violate First Amendment rights of speech and association,” said David Cole, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
0~Venice Mayor Is Arrested on Corruption Charges~ROME — The Italian authorities on Wednesday arrested the mayor of Venice and more than 30 others in a political corruption case linked to the city’s multibillion dollar flood-protection project. The arrests came only weeks after investigators revealed an embarrassing corruption scandal involving projects for next year’s Milan Expo. Mayor Giorgio Orsoni of Venice was placed under house arrest on Wednesday morning on charges that he misused public funds from a project to build underwater barriers to protect the ancient city. Investigators also arrested a number of other elected officials in the Venice region and were seeking the arrest of a member of the lower house of Parliament. Corruption scandals are not uncommon in Italy, but the latest arrests in Venice and Milan involve prestige projects in regions where governance is usually considered more trustworthy. Prosecutors on Wednesday accused Mr. Orsoni of directing public money for “political purposes.” Investigators also are examining whether politicians accepted about 25 million euros, more than $34 million, in bribes in exchange for awarding contracts on the flood-protection project. In a televised news conference, Carlo Nordio, one of the prosecutors in the case, said local businessmen and politicians had established a sophisticated system to divert money for bribes, including slush fund accounts in Switzerland and San Marino. He said businessmen used inflated bills and false consulting contracts to generate payments from public funds that were then diverted to politicians as bribes.
0~China Halves Covid Quarantine Time for International Arrivals~China is halving the time that people arriving from overseas must stay in a Covid-19 quarantine facility, reducing it from two weeks to one, the country’s National Health Commission said on Tuesday. The step was welcomed by some investors but greeted cautiously by others. Since early 2020, China has enforced some of the strictest entry rules in the world, requiring that nearly everyone coming from overseas go into government-run quarantine — often in a designated hotel — for at least 14 days, followed by isolation at home. The new rules issued by the National Health Commission say that time will be cut to seven days in the facility, followed by three days in home isolation with regular testing for the coronavirus throughout. Chinese investors appeared to welcome the changes. Foreign companies and some Chinese companies have complained that the government’s Covid isolation and shutdown rules were choking off business by deterring trips abroad and visits to China by investors and clients. The Shanghai stock market jumped after the new rules were announced.
0~Over 300 Die in Sumatra and Samoas Quakes~Devastation from two earthquakes thousands of miles apart spread throughout Southeast Asia and the South Pacific on Wednesday, leaving death, injuries and panic in their wake from Indonesia’s western coast to the far-flung islands of Samoa and American Samoa. On the island of Sumatra, in Indonesia, a 7.6-magnitude quake struck Wednesday evening just 30 miles off the coast of the city of Padang, killing at least 200 people and trapping thousands in buildings. Indonesian television stations showed images of flattened hospitals, hotels and houses, burning cars and terrified residents running in the center of the city. Power and telecommunications were cut, complicating rescue efforts when night fell. A second earthquake struck western Indonesia on Thursday morning more than 100 miles from the epicenter of the quake on Wednesday, The Associated Press reported. There were no immediate reports of damage. Early on Tuesday in the Samoas, an underwater 8.0 magnitude quake produced a tsunami that struck with little warning after dawn, causing at least 103 deaths and 145 injuries, destroying villages throughout the islands. “It is the worst one we have had,” said Lilo Malava, the police commissioner of Samoa, in a telephone interview.
0~Vaccinated People Can Get Covid, but It’s Most Likely Very Rare~More than two months after he was fully vaccinated against Covid, a doctor in New York woke up with a headache and a dull, heavy feeling of fatigue. A fever and chills soon followed, and his senses of taste and smell began to fade. This, he thought, could not be happening. But it was: He tested positive for the coronavirus. “It was a huge shock,” he said. He knew that no vaccine was perfect and that the Pfizer-BioNTech shots he received had been found 95 percent effective in a large clinical trial. “But somehow in my mind, it was 100 percent,” he said. The doctor, who requested anonymity to protect his privacy, is among the few reported cases of people who have been infected after being partly or even fully vaccinated. Nearly 83 million Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, and it’s unclear just how many of them will have a “breakthrough” infection, though two new reports suggest the number is very small. One study found that just four out of 8,121 fully vaccinated employees at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas became infected. The other found that only seven out of 14,990 workers at UC San Diego Health and the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles tested positive two or more weeks after receiving a second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Both reports, published on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, show how well the vaccines work in the real world, and during a period of intense transmission.
0~Virginia Tech Shooting Leaves 33 Dead~Thirty-three people were killed Monday on the campus of Virginia Tech in what appears to be the deadliest shooting rampage in American history, according to federal law enforcement officials. Many of the victims were students shot in a dorm and a classroom building. “Today, the university was struck with a tragedy that we consider of monumental proportions,” said the university’s president, Charles Steger. The campus police chief said this evening that 15 people were wounded by the gunman, although there were other reports of higher numbers of injuries. Witnesses described scenes of mass chaos and unimaginable horror as some students were lined up against a wall and shot. Others jumped out of windows to escape, or crouched on floors to take cover. The killings occurred in two separate attacks on the campus in Blacksburg, Va. The first took place around 7:15 a.m., when two people were shot and killed at a dormitory. More than two and a half hours later, 31 others, including the gunman, were shot and killed across campus in a classroom building, where some of the doors had been chained. Victims were found in different locations around the building. The first attack started as students were getting ready for classes or were on their way there. The university did not evacuate the campus or notify students of that attack until several hours later. As the rampage unfolded, details emerged from witnesses describing a gunman going room to room in a dormitory, Ambler Johnston Hall, and of gunfire later at Norris Hall, a science and engineering classroom building. When it was over, even sidewalks were stained with blood. Among those dead was the gunman, whose body was found along with victims in Norris Hall. “Norris Hall is a tragic and sorrowful crime scene,” said the campus police chief at Virginia Tech, Wendell Flinchum. Chief Flinchum said the gunman took his own life. He said at a televised news briefing Monday evening that the police had a preliminary identification of the suspected gunman but were not yet ready to release it. He said the gunman was not a student. According to a federal law enforcement official, the gunman did not have identification and could not be easily identified visually because of the severity of an apparently self-inflicted wound to the head. He said investigators were trying to trace purchase records for two handguns found near the body. At televised news conferences Monday afternoon and Monday evening, Chief Flinchum and Mr. Steger tried to explain why authorities did not act to secure the rest of the campus immediately after the first shooting. Chief Flinchum said that initially officials thought that the shooting was “domestic,” suggesting that it was between individuals who knew each other, and isolated to the dormitory. He said the campus was not shut down after the first shooting because authorities thought that the attacker may have left the campus, or even the state. “We knew we had two people shot,” he said. “We secured the building. We secured the crime scene.” He later added: “We acted on the best information we had at the time.” Chief Flinchum said officers initially began investigating a “person of interest” as a result of the dormitory shootings. The person, a man, was described as a friend of one of the dorm victims, but Chief Flinchum said the police had not detained him.

Alan Kim/The Roanoke Times, via Associated Press At 9:45, the police got another 911 call about shootings at Norris Hall, just as university officials were meeting to discuss the first shootings. “We were actually having a meeting about the earlier shootings when we learned that another shooting was under way,” Mr. Steger told reporters Monday night. By the time officers arrived, the shooting had stopped and the gunman had killed himself, the chief said. The police appeared to believe that the two shootings were related, but said they could not confirm that until they had the results of a ballistics analysis. A parent of one student, Elaine Goss, said her son Alec Calhoun, a junior engineering major, jumped out a second-story window in Norris Hall when the gunman entered his classroom. She said that she first spoke to her son, “I couldn’t understand him; it was like gibberish.” “It took a while to figure out shootings, lots of shootings, and that his whole class had jumped out the window,” she said. Ms. Goss said her son hurt his back in the jump and went to a hospital. Another student, Jessica Paulson, said she was on the fourth floor at Ambler Johnston Hall when the shootings occurred on the opposite side of the floor. “You could hear two shots,” one followed shortly by a second, recounted Ms. Paulson, who was preparing to go to an early class. Neither she nor most of the other students nearby understood what had happened until several hours later. At least 17 Virginia Tech students were being treated for gunshot wounds and other injuries at Montgomery Regional Hospital, and four of them were in surgery, according to a hospital spokesman. At Lewis-Gale Medical Center in Salem, Va., four students and a staff member were treated for injuries. Two were in stable condition, and the conditions of the other three were described as “undetermined.” Officials said there may have been more injured and taken to other medical facilities. The university has more than 25,000 full-time students on a campus that is spread over 2,600 acres. The atmosphere on the Virginia Tech campus was desolate and preternaturally quiet by Monday afternoon. Students gathered in small groups, some crying, some talking quietly and others consoling each other. Some students complained that they had not been notified of the first shooting on campus for more than two hours. Kirsten Bernhards, 18, said she and many other students had no idea that a shooting had occurred when she left her dorm room in O’Shaughnessy Hall shortly before 10 a.m., more than two hours after the first shootings. “I was leaving for my 10:10 film class,” she said. “I had just locked the door and my neighbor said, ‘Did you check your e-mail?’ ” The university had, a few minutes earlier, sent out a bulletin warning students about an apparent gunman. But few students seemed to have any sense of urgency. Ms. Bernhards said she walked toward her class, preoccupied with an upcoming exam and listening to music on her iPod. On the way, she said, she heard some loud cracks, and only later concluded they had been gunshots from the second round of shootings.
0~The Scorpion’s Tale: Did Assad Take Putin for a Ride?~“They are like a man with two wives,” said Ms. Khalil, best known for defending Saddam Hussein in his war crimes trial in Iraq. “There is something you like in each one.” Ms. Khalil, who compared Mr. Assad to de Gaulle, is a longtime supporter of his, with a flair for flamboyant statements, and her meetings with officials were not about the war but about a court case involving a son of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan dictator. But her description of the inner circle’s mood and modus operandi was echoed by many others, both supporters and detractors, who have met with Mr. Assad or his advisers and allies in recent months. They include scholars, humanitarian officials, Syrian associates, diplomats and officials with the pro-government alliance that includes Iran, Russia and Hezbollah. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to preserve their access to government officials or to avoid reprisals. Over and over again in separate interviews, these people described a leadership that is expert in playing allies off one another; often refuses compromise, even when the chips appear to be down; and, if forced to make deals, delays and complicates them, playing for time until Mr. Assad’s situation improves. Mr. Putin seems bent on capping a triumphant return to the world stage by presiding over a political solution for Syria, hand in hand with the United States. Several diplomats said that Russia defined victory as a negotiated solution that would leave Mr. Assad in power — showing that Western aspirations for regime change had failed — but that Mr. Putin might back a deal that would ease the Syrian leader out later or diminish his power. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. While Iran appears more attached to keeping Mr. Assad in power, it is becoming clear that without Russian air power, Iranian support is not enough to help Syrian government forces advance, despite thousands of ground troops from Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias. So Mr. Assad most likely realizes that he has to engage in some kind of political process, at least to satisfy Mr. Putin, said Mr. Lesch, the biographer, who regularly visited Mr. Assad from 2004 to 2009 and has met with high-level Syrian government officials and opposition members since the civil war started in 2011.
0~Trash-Talking Toward Conflict?~The leader of the junior partner in Greece’s coalition government, Defense Minister Panos Kammenos, used the anniversary of the start of the Greek war of independence, March 25, to declare, “We will crush whoever dares to question our national sovereignty.” Referring to Mr. Erdogan’s recent talk of a “great Turkey” following the invasion of the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northern Syria, Mr. Kammenos added: “Whoever has in mind large Ottoman empires should remember 1821, how the Greek people faced the Ottoman Empire and crushed it.” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim of Turkey picked up the thread. “Turkey will never tolerate certain circles which violate our sovereignty in the Mediterranean and the Aegean,” he declared. “Those who play at being pirates in the Aegean should not forget Sept. 9, 1922,” he added. Enmity and suspicion between Greece and Turkey was not erased by their joint accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1952. The two came close to war in 1974, when Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied its north in response to a coup by Greek Cypriots who wanted to unite the island republic with Greece. In 1987 and 1996, disputes over sea and territorial rights in the Aegean again nearly led to war. Turkish warplanes continually fly into the 10-mile airspace around islands declared by Athens and over islets whose sovereignty Turkey questions. Ankara’s declaration that the two uninhabited Imia islets are Turkish has raised the stakes: urgent mediation by the United States in 1996 prevented conflict over the islets, resulting in an agreement that neither side would dispatch ships there or raise flags on them. Today such mediation is less likely. Having grown accustomed to expressing outspoken criticism of the United States because of Washington’s objections to Turkey’s invasion of the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in Syria, Mr. Erdogan is not likely to back down in any confrontation with Greece. President Trump’s recent statement that United States troops would leave Syria “very soon” — whenever that may be — must have boosted Turkey’s self-confidence. European mediation could be even less effective. On March 22, the European Council — the leaders of the European Union member states — said that it “strongly condemns Turkey’s continued illegal actions in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea and underlines its full solidarity with Cyprus and Greece.” The Turkish Foreign Ministry dismissed the statement. “Such wordings solely based on the Greek Cypriot and Greek claims are unacceptable,” it said. The Turkish minister of European Union affairs, Omer Celik, tweeted, “Solidarity is meaningful only when it is legitimate.” Ankara clearly does not feel threatened by criticism that could weaken ties with the European Union. It is also keen to point out that it can control the flow of refugees and migrants, whose mass influx in 2015 shook politics in many European countries, suggesting that they may need Ankara’s good will more than it needs theirs.
0~No, You Do Not Have to Drink 8 Glasses of Water a Day~I’m a pediatrician, and I can tell you that I have rarely, if ever, used urine osmolality as the means by which I decide if a child is dehydrated. When I asked colleagues, none thought 800 mOsm/kg was the value at which they’d be concerned. And in a web search, most sources I found thought values up to 1,200 mOsm/kg were still in the physiologically normal range and that children varied more than adults. None declared that 800 mOsm/kg was where we’d consider children to be dehydrated. In other words, there’s very little reason to believe that children who have a spot urine measurement of 800 mOsm/kg should be worried. In fact, back in 2002, a study was published in the Journal of Pediatrics, one that was more exploratory in nature than a look for dehydration, and it found that boys in Germany had an average urine osmolality of 844 mOsm/kg. The third-to-last paragraph in the paper recounted a huge number of studies from all over the world finding average urine mOsm/kg in children ranging from 392 mOsm/kg in Kenya to 964 in Sweden. That hasn’t stopped more recent studies from continuing to use the 800 mOsm/kg standard to declare huge numbers of children to be dehydrated. A 2012 study in the Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism used it to declare that almost two-thirds of French children weren’t getting enough water. Another in the journal Public Health Nutrition used it to declare that almost two-thirds of children in Los Angeles and New York City weren’t getting enough water. The first study was funded by Nestlé Waters; the second by Nestec, a Nestlé subsidiary. It’s possible that there are children who need to be better hydrated. But at some point, we are at risk of calling an ordinary healthy condition a disease. When two-thirds of healthy children, year after year, are found to have a laboratory value that you are labeling “abnormal,” it may be the definition, and not their health, that is off. None of this has slowed the tidal push for more water. It has even been part of Michelle Obama’s “Drink Up” campaign. In 2013, Sam Kass, then a White House nutritional policy adviser, declared “40 percent of Americans drink less than half of the recommended amount of water daily.” There is no formal recommendation for a daily amount of water people need. That amount obviously differs by what people eat, where they live, how big they are and what they are doing. But as people in this country live longer than ever before, and have arguably freer access to beverages than at almost any time in human history, it’s just not true that we’re all dehydrated.
0~Justice Dept. to Open Investigation Into Kenosha Shooting~[Read more on Rusten Sheskey not being charged in the Jacob Blake shooting.] KENOSHA, Wis. — The Justice Department on Wednesday announced a civil rights investigation into the police shooting of a Black man in Kenosha, Wis., as new details emerged in the case, a white teenager who confronted demonstrators was arrested in connection with two deaths, and protests spread to athletes in three pro sports leagues. Protesters have poured into Kenosha’s streets to decry the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black father who was partially paralyzed after a white officer fired at him in front of his children. The authorities released new details of the case on Wednesday that gave a clearer picture of why police officers confronted Mr. Blake, who they said had a knife. Amid the ire over the shooting of Mr. Blake, some in Kenosha have torched buildings, and the authorities have fired tear gas in an effort to clear the streets. Counterprotesters have also emerged, and gunfire broke out along one crowded, dark street late Tuesday, sending bystanders fleeing into parking lots and screaming in terror.
0~Suicides Have Increased. Is This an Existential Crisis?~Critically, studies indicate that it isn’t enough to simply be around or even liked by other people. We need to feel valued by them, to feel we are making important contributions to a world that matters. This helps explain why people can feel lonely and meaningless even if they are regularly surrounded by others who treat them well: Merely pleasant or enjoyable social encounters aren’t enough to stave off despair. All of which brings us to the changing social landscape of America. To bemoan the decline of neighborliness, the shrinking of the family and the diminishing role of religion may sound like the complaining of a crotchety old man. Yet from the standpoint of psychological science, these changes, regardless of what you otherwise think about them, pose serious threats to a life of meaning. Consider that Americans today, compared with those of past generations, are less likely to know and interact with their neighbors, to believe that people are generally trustworthy and to feel that they have individuals they can confide in. This is a worrisome development from an existential perspective: Studies have shown that the more people feel a strong sense of belongingness, the more they perceive life as meaningful. Other studies have shown that lonely people view life as less meaningful than those who feel strongly connected to others. Something similar is at stake in the decreasing size of the family. Americans today are waiting longer to marry and have children, and are having fewer children. This may be a desirable state of affairs for many people (though evidence suggests that American women are having fewer children than they want). Nonetheless, researchers have found that adults with children are more focused on matters of meaning than are adults who do not have children, and that parents experience a greater sense of meaningfulness when they are engaged in activities that involve taking care of children. As for religion, which has long provided the institutional and social scaffolding for a life of meaning, it, too, is in steep decline. Americans these days, especially young adults, are less likely to identify with a religious faith, attend church or engage in other religious practices. But as my research has shown, the sense of meaningfulness provided by religion is not so easily replicated in nonreligious settings: When Americans abandon traditional houses of worship, they increasingly search for alternative religious-like experiences (including those involving ideas about ghosts or space aliens) in order to feel as if they are part of something larger and more meaningful than their brief mortal lives. There is even reason to think that America’s existential crisis may be contributing to our rancorous political divisions. Studies show that when presented with existentially threatening ideas (such as reminders of their mortality), people respond with increased bias toward their own worldview, particularly if they are not finding meaning in their life through other sources. In this way, our fractious political culture may be fueled not just by ideological disagreement, but also by a desperate search, common to all lost souls, to find meaning anywhere we can.
0~Director Released From Hospital After Being Shot on Baldwin Film~Joel Souza, the director who was shot Thursday on the set of Alec Baldwin’s film “Rust,” was released from a hospital in New Mexico late Thursday and is expected to make a full recovery, according to a person with knowledge of his condition. Mr. Souza, 48, was rushed to Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center after Mr. Baldwin fired a gun used as a prop, killing the movie’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, according to the police. The person with knowledge of Mr. Souza’s condition, who works with the production company, requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the case publicly. “Director Joel Souza told me he’s out of hospital,” Frances Fisher, an actress in the movie, wrote on Twitter early Friday, in response to reports that Mr. Souza might have been seriously injured.
0~Title Retained After Ugly End to the ‘Thrilla in Manila’~Wearing dark glasses to hide his puffed eyes, especially his right eye, Frazier agreed with Futch. “I didn’t want to be stopped, I wanted to go on,” Frazier said, “but I’d never go against Eddie.” Frazier dismissed questions about retirement, saying, “I’m not thinking that way now.” But the weary champion indicated that the “Thrilla in Manila” might have been his last fight. “You may have seen the last of Ali,” the champion said. “I want to get out of it. I’m tired and on top. What you saw tonight was next to death. He’s the toughest man in the world.” Ali attempted to register the early knockout he had predicted while dominating the early rounds. But then Frazier, in his relentless attack, smashed and slowed the 33-year-old champion. They resembled two old bull moose who had to stand and slam each other because they couldn’t get away from each other. Through the middle rounds, Frazier took command. On the two scorecards of The New York Times, the 31-year-old challenger won eight of the first 11 rounds. But then Ali searched for the knockout punch that would assure the retention of the title. Moving on weary legs, Ali began to measure Frazier in the 12th with a flurry of punches to Frazier’s face, which resembled a squashed chocolate marshmallow. In the 13th, the champion quickly knocked out Frazier’s mouthpiece with a long left hook, then landed a left-right combination.
0~Allyson Felix: My Own Nike Pregnancy Story~The culture around pregnancy in track and field is silence. Get pregnant and you hide it. It can feel so risky when your livelihood depends on it. I’m Allyson Felix and I’ve won nine Olympic track and field medals, and that makes me one of the most decorated women in track and field history. I’ve done a lot of promotion for Nike. They’ve used me in a lot of their stores. And a lot of the campaigns. But I’m also a mother. I don’t think I can just sit back quietly anymore. I want protection around maternity. I want that to change. I know that it’s been said, but I want to see change. I’m in this process right now. I am under negotiations. I want to be able to sign a contract that says there is maternity rights. Just about a week ago, I asked for protection around maternity and the answer was no. So the negotiations have been ongoing for a long time. I haven’t been under contract since December 2017. I was already offered 70% less of what I had been paid before. I can take less money. But the one point that I wasn’t willing to budge around was maternity, and not because I am planning to have another child. But just because it’s the right thing to do. And if not for myself, for people coming after me. Putting really strict requirements on our returning to competition takes away from our mothering. It could jeopardize our health. I was not aware that I was at a higher risk to have complications during my birth, but what I have since learned is that African-American women are four times more likely to die in childbirth and twice as more likely to have complications. And that’s exactly what happened to me. You never know what type of birth you’re going to have. When I went in for a routine appointment at 32 weeks, I never went home. I gave birth to my daughter two days later and spent the next month in the hospital between myself and my daughter. And while I am spending countless hours in the NICU I’m coming home at 1 a.m. trying to figure out how can I get to the gym to put a few hours in, because I know I have to be ready to run in six months. Many times I just felt like, you know, I was in an impossible situation. If I’ve been told no, you won’t have any protection around maternity, then it’s going to be really hard for someone else. This has been going on forever. If you talk to any woman, I guarantee you that they know someone who has been through this. The sports industry allows for men to have a full career. And when a woman decides to have a baby, it pushes women out at their prime. When the New York Times piece came out, a lot of people called me to find out, is this true? It definitely hit home for runners. It was really difficult for me to see the “Dream Crazier” campaign. I mean, there are thousands of other female athletes who represent Nike who don’t have that same protection. Alysia and Kara bravely spoke out. And here we are a week later and it’s said to have changed. This is a great opportunity for Nike to really spell out what the new agreement is. What protection do women have? What does that look like? Are we going to face reductions returning from childbirth? Is that going to be a 12-month period? We need to see what does that actually look like and what does that actually mean. The individuals who are negotiating these contracts are all men. And it might be more difficult for them to understand what we are going through and what we have been through and what we need.
0~Downfall of André Esteves Stands Out in Brazil Scandal~SÃO PAULO, Brazil — André Esteves is not the only rich and powerful Brazilian to be swept up in a corruption investigation that has rocked the country. Police officials here say they have found evidence that scores of politicians and business executives siphoned off funds from the government-controlled petroleum company Petrobras and some of its contractors. But what sets the case of Mr. Esteves — who built and led the investment bank BTG Pactual — apart from those of the other accused men and women is its apparent senselessness. “The deals BTG Pactual had with Petrobras and the government were relatively small and had nothing to do with the bank’s core business, which was very profitable,” said Luis Miguel Santacreu, a financial sector analyst with the Brazilian credit ratings agency Austin Rating. “They didn’t need any of these deals to keep on growing.”
0~Pelosi and Schumer Say They Have Deal With Trump to Replace DACA~WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders on Wednesday night declared that they had a deal with President Trump to quickly extend protections for young undocumented immigrants and to finalize a border security package that does not include the president’s proposed wall. The Democrats, Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, said in a joint statement that they had a “very productive” dinner meeting with the president at the White House that focused on the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. “We agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that’s acceptable to both sides,” they said. But on Thursday morning, the president contradicted the Democrats, saying no deal had been struck. (Read that article.) In a statement on Wednesday night, the White House was far more muted, mentioning DACA as merely one of several issues that were discussed, including tax reform and infrastructure. It called the meeting, which came a week after the president struck a stunning spending-and-debt deal with the Democratic leaders, “a positive step toward the president’s strong commitment to bipartisan solutions.”
0~With Obamacare Fight Lost, Conservatives Turn to Veterans’ Care~WASHINGTON — With their hopes of repealing the Affordable Care Act dashed for now, deep-pocketed conservative activists have turned their attention to a smaller but still potent new effort: allowing private health care to compete with Veterans Affairs hospitals for the patronage of the nation’s veterans. Concerned Veterans for America, a little-known advocacy group backed by the conservative billionaire industrialists Charles G. and David H. Koch, is pressing Republicans to make it easier for veterans to see private doctors at government expense. The group’s voice had been lonely until recently, when a raft of Koch-connected advocacy organizations and other conservative allies joined the effort. That has in many cases pitted conservative advocates against congressionally chartered, old-line groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion that have long guarded the Veterans Affairs system that they helped build. “We actually have members that guide our advocacy and our voice as opposed to a small partisan think tank of ideologues,” said Louis Celli, the national director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation for the American Legion. “We get our voice from our two-million-person membership base that actually use V.A. services and tell us what they are looking for.”
0~Birmingham Mayor Orders Removal of Confederate Monument in Public Park~On Sunday night, demonstrators gathered at the park, in downtown Birmingham, to protest the death last week of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his left knee into Mr. Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Protests have since spread across the country, and the officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. In Linn Park on Sunday, the demonstration turned violent. Some of the protesters targeted the statue’s 52-foot-tall sandstone obelisk, spray-painting and chipping at its base. They also tried to topple it using a rope and a truck, according to news media reports. On Monday, Mr. Woodfin vowed to take it down. He said its very presence would cause more unrest and division and would pose continued threats to public safety, outweighing any legal implications. “In order to prevent more civil unrest, it is very imperative that we remove this statue,” Mr. Woodfin told AL.com, the website for The Birmingham News. “I understand the A.G.’s office can bring a civil suit against the city, and if there’s a judgment rendered from a judge then we should be held accountable, and I am willing to accept that because that is a lower cost than civil unrest in our city.”
0~Bob Dylan 101: A Harvard Professor Has the Coolest Class on Campus~For the Harvard classics professor Richard F. Thomas, who has been gently teased by colleagues for teaching a freshman seminar about Bob Dylan — as well as for the students who sometimes get double takes for choosing the course — the announcement of the newest Nobel laureate in literature was hailed as vindication. And cause to break out celebratory cupcakes at the fortuitously timed Thursday afternoon session. Mr. Thomas uses the course, simply called “Bob Dylan,” to put the artist in context of not just popular culture of the last half-century, but the tradition of classical poets like Virgil and Homer. The class follows Mr. Dylan’s career chronologically, listening to selections from most of his dozens and dozens of albums while also reading his memoir, “Chronicles,” which Mr. Thomas calls in the course description “a work of genius, a sprawling Dylan prose song posing as an autobiography.” [ Bob Dylan wins the Nobel Prize in Literature | Our pop critic on Dylan, the musician | Our book critic on Dylan, the writer ] “One of the coolest things is learning about Bob Dylan from a world expert on Virgil,” said Ethan McCollister, 18, from East Montpelier, Vt. “Both are poets, and both are lyricists even more than that.”
0~Companies Linked to Russian Ransomware Hide in Plain Sight~MOSCOW — When cybersleuths traced the millions of dollars American companies, hospitals and city governments have paid to online extortionists in ransom money, they made a telling discovery: At least some of it passed through one of the most prestigious business addresses in Moscow. The Biden administration has also zeroed in on the building, Federation Tower East, the tallest skyscraper in the Russian capital. The United States has targeted several companies in the tower as it seeks to penalize Russian ransomware gangs, which encrypt their victims’ digital data and then demand payments to unscramble it. Those payments are typically made in cryptocurrencies, virtual currencies like Bitcoin, which the gangs then need to convert to standard currencies, like dollars, euros and rubles. That this high-rise in Moscow’s financial district has emerged as an apparent hub of such money laundering has convinced many security experts that the Russian authorities tolerate ransomware operators. The targets are almost exclusively outside Russia, they point out, and in at least one case documented in a U.S. sanctions announcement, the suspect was assisting a Russian espionage agency.
0~Profits at 21st Century Fox Hampered by TV Investments~Investments in new cable channels were a drag on 21st Century Fox’s third-quarter profits, but total revenues still surpassed analysts’ expectations. In its first three months as a separate company, Fox reported on Tuesday, its revenues totaled $7.06 billion, ahead of the Wall Street consensus of $6.8 billion (and up from $6 billion in the same quarter a year earlier). But its adjusted net income of $768 million, or 33 cents a share, came in slightly under expectations of 35 cents a share. (Before adjustments for one-time gains, it reported earnings of 54 cents a share in the quarter, versus 94 cents a share in the same quarter a year earlier.) The decline in profit was partly because of the company’s creation of Fox Sports 1, a cable channel that it hopes will one day rival ESPN. Fox Sports 1 had its premiere in August, causing a significant increase in expenses. The company also started a spinoff of its entertainment channel FX, called FXX, in September. “The investment we are making, including the launch of FXX and Fox Sports 1, will drive future sustained growth toward our stated 2016 target of $9 billion of Oibda and beyond,” Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of the company, said in a statement. Oibda (operating income before depreciation and amortization) is a measure of profit.
0~Trump Administration Stalls Largest Tech Merger in New Sign of Protectionism~Experts said they couldn’t recall another instance of the committee’s intervening in a transaction that hadn’t been completed, much less one that is as fluid and bitterly contested as this one. Broadcom unveiled its bid for Qualcomm in November. Together, the two make chips for most of the world’s smartphones, and a merger would be the largest technology deal in history. But Qualcomm rebuffed the approach, arguing that Broadcom was fundamentally underestimating the company’s value. Broadcom had sought to pave the way for its bid by changing its headquarters to the United States, an announcement that the company’s chief executive, Hock Tan, made alongside Mr. Trump at the White House last year. Mr. Trump hailed the relocation as a sign that the United States business climate was improving under his watch. Broadcom argued that its status as a soon-to-be-American company meant the Qualcomm deal should not be subject to review by Cfius. Qualcomm nonetheless appealed to regulators to get involved. The committee, which is made up of officials from agencies including the Treasury, Commerce, Defense, State and Justice Departments, ultimately concluded that it had the authority to order the 30-day delay of the shareholder meeting. The Trump administration has been under intense pressure from lawmakers in recent weeks to block Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm on the grounds that the acquisition could threaten national security and cripple America’s ability to compete with China in the race for telecommunications supremacy. “Qualcomm’s work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company — and in a hostile takeover, no less,” said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas. “I would like to see Cfius more active especially regarding China and regarding critical industries.”
0~Afghan President Appoints a Second Female Governor~“The commitment of the current government is better,” said Ms. Sarabi, who now advises Abdullah Abdullah, the country’s chief executive, who shares power with Mr. Ghani. The two men “have promised to appoint three female governors,” Ms. Sarabi said. “But the selection needs to be very careful, as we women are vulnerable.” Ms. Joyenda lamented that her appointment came at a time when international aid had diminished and the “government is struggling economically.” Meeting the needs of people in a deprived province like Ghor, with a literacy rate of about 21 percent, will be difficult, she said. “I do wish I had been appointed to a province that, if it had security problems, it would be better on the development front, and that if it had development problems, it would be better on the social front,” she said. “Ghor, unfortunately, has problems in all those areas. But we will adjust to the reality; we will try to be transparent with the little we get and make sure everyone feels a part of the government.” Governors, who control all civilian and military activities in Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, have substantial authority and patronage, at least on paper. Yet in a country where institutions often take a back seat to warlords and strongmen, a governor is required to maneuver among clashing local forces. What is happening over Ms. Muradi’s appointment is an example of that. Provincial strongmen and political leaders in Kabul want one of their allies to become governor. There have been similar protests against the appointment of a new governor for Bamian Province, a man, suggesting that Ms. Muradi has been as much a victim of clashing political interests as of sexism. “The ordinary people of Daikundi are happy with the central government’s decision to appoint a female governor, and they fully support the decision,” said Haji Ghairat Jawaheri, a member of the provincial council in Daikundi. “However, there are a series of issues relating to political leaders here that is stopping her.”

0~Pyeongchang Olympic Bid Leaders’ Convictions Unlikely to Affect Chances~The mountain resort of Pyeongchang, about 100 miles east of Seoul, South Korea, is seen as a likely front-runner to host the 2018 Winter Games when members of the International Olympic Committee vote on the site next July. Committee members prefer awarding the Games to different regions of the globe, and Pyeongchang has the advantage of being in Asia, where the Winter Games have been held only twice, in 1998 and 1972. Its two competitors, by contrast, are in Europe: Munich, and Annecy, France. Some say Pyeongchang’s time to win has come after narrowly losing to Vancouver, British Columbia, for the 2010 Games and to Sochi, Russia, for 2014. Pyeongchang remains a favorite even though four leaders in promoting the bid have been convicted in South Korea of financial malfeasance or political corruption. And last month, the International Olympic Committee issued a warning to the Pyeongchang committee after a bid sponsor, Korean Air, signed a sponsorship deal with the International Skating Federation, whose president is eligible to vote in July. Olympic leaders have sought to take a hard line against corruption and conflicts of interest ever since the ethics scandal for the 2002 Salt Lake Games led to the expulsion of I.O.C. members, for accepting improper gifts and other benefits, and an overhaul of the rules governing how host cities are chosen.
0~S.E.C. Chairwoman’s Ethics Under Fire~Mr. Becker did not return a call for comment. In correspondence with lawmakers late last month, Mr. Becker also said that he alerted the ethics office about his family’s Madoff investment again that May after he received a letter from a number of law firms representing Madoff victims asking that the commission change its proposed compensation formula. Among the issues are whether Madoff investors who withdrew money before the fraud was exposed must return some of their proceeds  and if so, how much  to other investors. “I recognized that it was conceivable that this issue could affect my financial interests because the issue could affect the trustee’s decision to bring clawback actions against persons like me,” Mr. Becker wrote in response to lawmakers. The ethics officer approved his participation, he said. That officer reported directly to Mr. Becker and spent only 25 minutes reviewing the matter, according to Congressional staff members briefed on the discussions who requested anonymity because they also were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Congressional investigators want to know if Mr. Becker and Ms. Schapiro took all the necessary steps outlined in government ethics rules. Under the United States code, for example, Ms. Schapiro may have been required to make a written determination that Mr. Becker’s financial interest was not substantial enough to affect his job performance. A spokesman for the S.E.C. said that such a waiver would not be required unless Mr. Becker had been found to have a substantial financial conflict. Congress also asked Ms. Schapiro whether she discussed Mr. Becker’s Madoff account with other staff members or commissioners and if she took up the matter with officials in the federal government’s Office of Government Ethics, or the commission’s ethics counsel. “As the government official responsible for appointing Mr. Becker to his position in 2009, what steps did you take to manage the appearance of or actual conflict of interest presented by Mr. Becker’s financial interest in the Securities Investor Protection Corporation’ liquidation?” asked a March 1 letter signed by four Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee. They are Spencer Bacchus of Alabama, Jeb Hensarling of Texas, Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Mr. Neugebauer.
0~Trump Will Not Block Comey From Testifying, White House Says~WASHINGTON — White House officials said on Monday that President Trump would not invoke executive privilege to try to block James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired, from testifying before Congress this week, clearing the way for a hearing that may be the most anticipated in Washington in months, if not years. Mr. Comey is scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday for his first public discussion of the events that led to his dismissal last month in the midst of leading an investigation into associates of Mr. Trump’s. Lawmakers are especially interested in reports that Mr. Trump sought to persuade Mr. Comey to shut down an investigation into the president’s former national security adviser. It was not clear that Mr. Trump would have succeeded in stopping Mr. Comey from testifying had he chosen to cite executive privilege. The Supreme Court has found that presidents enjoy a right to confidentiality in communications with their advisers, but it is not an absolute privilege and courts have overridden such claims in the past.
0~Listen to Bob Dylan’s Many Influences~This week, Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” But, as Mr. Dylan himself has said, his songs “didn’t get here by themselves.” The influences that have informed Mr. Dylan’s work are legion. Early on, Country and Western music. Later, the rock ’n’ roll of Chuck Berry and Little Richard. In his teens, he discovered folk musicians like Odetta, and became enamored of Woody Guthrie, even imitating Guthrie’s Oklahoma twang. He arrived on the Greenwich Village folk scene in New York in January 1961, and continued absorbing folk and traditional songs wherever he could find them — from fellow performers, from books like Alan Lomax’s “Folk Songs of North America,” and from records. And not only other music inspired him — poetry, literature and film have all made their way into his work. But his true importance is that he was able to internalize these disparate influences, and to transform them, with great courage and sensitivity, into a sound that was uniquely, unmistakably his own. Indeed, to create “new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” All music previews and full tracks provided by Spotify.

We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting... BLITZER: ... Thank you... KASICH: ... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...BLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea? CARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don’t get time. I’m going to whine because I didn’t get asked about taxes, I didn’t get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you’re going to be fair to everybody, you didn’t ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that. Now... BLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment. (APPLAUSE) CARSON: OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn’t find anything, so they said let’s look at the whole year. And they didn’t find anything, so they said let’s look at the next year and the next year. They didn’t find anything and they won’t find anything because I’m a very honest person. But he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them. (APPLAUSE) And as far as Israel is concerned, you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn’t find a single one who didn’t think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn’t mean that we can’t be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it’s like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child. And now, as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well. And we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.
0~Covid News: W.H.O. Warns Health Care Workers Are Burning Out~Image Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, left, touring a coronavirus vaccination site earlier this month in Newark. Credit... Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock Now that federal regulators have cleared booster shots of all three coronavirus vaccines in use in the United States, state health authorities and pharmacies have begun rolling out plans to get even more shots in arms. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommended Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters on Thursday for tens of millions of Americans, a move that came nearly a month after many Pfizer-BioNTech recipients were cleared for boosters of that company’s vaccine. The C.D.C. also gave a green light to a “mix-and-match” strategy so people who are eligible for boosters can decide to get a dose of a different type than the one they first received. And as states, pharmacies and doctors began on Friday trying to get these shots into arms, they faced a variety of complex issues — they will have to help people understand whether they are eligible and answer questions about which booster to get. According to the C.D.C., certain groups of people who received their second dose of an mRNA vaccine six or more months ago are now eligible for a booster. Those who qualify are people 65 and older, those 18 and older who live in long-term care, and those who have underlying medical conditions or work or live in settings placing them at high risk of infection. For those who received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, anyone 18 and older who was vaccinated two or more months ago is eligible. The Moderna booster, whether people originally got that company’s vaccine or either of the other two, will be a half-dose shot. Limited evidence strongly suggests that booster doses of one of the two mRNA vaccines — Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech — more effectively raise antibody levels than a booster dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. “Now with 10 months of vaccine experience, some may have an express preference for one booster type over another,” Dr. Walensky said on Friday, referring to the mix-and-match option, adding that it was “perfectly fine” for people to choose a booster of the same vaccine that they received initially. Other challenges medical providers will contend with include reaching marginalized groups, including homeless people and migrant workers, who may have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine when it was only meant as a single-dose option, and making sure that people receive the correct dose of a Moderna booster. More than 120 million Americans will become eligible for a booster in the coming months, Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said at a news conference on Friday, adding that boosters were available at more than 80,000 locations across the country, including at least 40,000 local pharmacies. CVS and Walgreens said they expanded their booster offerings on Friday, and were able to provide “mix-and-match” doses. State health departments generally follow the recommendations of the C.D.C., and many were prepared to begin moving ahead with boosters. On Friday, Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado got a Moderna booster, after receiving his second Moderna shot six months earlier. Mr. Polis, 46, said he was eligible because his job puts him at high risk of exposure. “Like most Coloradans and Americans, I am ready to put this pandemic behind us,” Mr. Polis said from behind a medical mask, adding. “I am excited to get this level of protection.” In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan welcomed the C.D.C.’s guidance on Friday, saying in a statement that “Eligible Marylanders may now choose which vaccine they want for a booster, even if it is different from what they received initially.” Officials said that the state had been preparing for the decision for months, with more than 300 sites available since last month, including large and small pharmacies, hospitals, urgent care centers and mobile vaccination operations. In Vermont, Gov. Phil Scott announced that eligible residents could receive the new boosters beginning on Friday. In Oregon, the state health department has enrolled hundreds of providers to administer boosters, and will train them on giving different amounts of doses, according to Kristen Dillon, a senior adviser to the state’s Covid response and recovery unit. Officials in New Jersey said they would open several state mass vaccination sites to handle the expected demand, in addition to offering shots at schools, pharmacies and large county sites. Coral Murphy Marcos and Giulia Heyward contributed reporting.
0~Scant Drug Maker Oversight in Meningitis Outbreak~Because of the outbreak, Dr. Cohen has stopped performing spinal injections for now, and he was planning to declare a moratorium on them at his hospital until he was certain all the medicine was clean, even though his hospital is not on the list of facilities that received the potentially contaminated drug. The size of New England Compounding appears to have reassured some doctors, who thought dealing with a large company might be safer than buying from a mom-and-pop compounder. One pain specialist said he had heard from colleagues that the company had a good reputation and that even prestigious hospitals had used it. His practice did not buy the steroid medicine from New England Compounding but a contrast agent, a type of dye used for imaging. After he first contacted the Massachusetts company, it flew in a sales representative to meet him. “We were impressed,” said the doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he had not yet consulted his malpractice insurer about whether he should publicly identify himself as having bought products from New England Compounding. “It seemed like big time.” The representative “assured me that all standards are being met.” But all the dye the doctor bought from New England Compounding has had to be thrown out on the chance that it also might be contaminated, he said. And the Massachusetts company itself has a troubled past. A series of complaints had been lodged against New England Compounding over the past decade. The State Health Department inspected in 2006. According to a warning letter sent by the F.D.A. from that year, the company was accused of illegally producing a standardized anesthetic topical cream, inappropriately repackaging a drug, and telling doctors that using an office staff member’s name was enough to put in an order, even though rules require a prescription for a particular patient. Issues of Law Meningitis can be caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi. Doctors say that the fungal type is the hardest to treat and devastating to patients because it can cause strokes. And indeed, some of the patients in the current outbreak have suffered strokes.
0~State’s Attorney Seeks Recusal in Chicago Officer’s Trial~The Cook County state’s attorney, Anita Alvarez, who was widely criticized for her handling of the killing of a black Chicago teenager in October 2014, asked to recuse herself and her office Thursday from the prosecution of a white Chicago police officer charged with murder in the case. After originally opposing activists who said the case should be handled by a special prosecutor because the state’s attorney was too closely allied with the Police Department, Ms. Alvarez, who lost the Democratic primary in March, asked the court to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the prosecution of Officer Jason Van Dyke in the killing of Laquan McDonald, who was 17. “While it is has not been an easy decision, I believe that it is the right one because it will help to avoid unnecessary legal delays and provide continuity in the handling of this very important and complicated case,” she said in a statement after Thursday morning’s court hearing. “It would also ensure that one designated prosecutor will handle this case as it proceeds to trial. While there is no legal conflict of interest that would prevent the state’s attorney’s office from continuing the prosecution of this case, I believe that the results of the recent election and the impending transition of this office make this the best and most responsible decision.”
0~Nike to Shut Down Salazar’s Oregon Project~The end of the Oregon Project is the latest development in a stunning downfall for Salazar and a fissure in one of the longest professional relationships of his life. Salazar has had a close relationship with Nike since he migrated to the Pacific Northwest from Massachusetts as a teenager to attend and run for the University of Oregon, alma mater of the Nike co-founder Phil H. Knight. Knight started the company that would become Nike with the famed Oregon coach Bill Bowerman shortly after graduating from Oregon, where he was a member of the track team. Nike sponsored Salazar as a professional, when he won three consecutive New York City Marathons and became the world’s top distance runner. His running career cratered in the mid-1980s as he battled injuries and depression. Salazar later became a sports marketing executive with Nike, and in 2001 founded the Oregon Project. The venture emulated other elite training groups that were popping up at the time, notably the Mammoth Lakes, Calif.-based Team Running U.S.A., but with far more money, access to Nike’s scientific research labs, and with America’s best-known distance runner at the helm. The biggest stars of the Oregon Project were Galen Rupp, an Oregonian Salazar discovered when he was a teenage soccer star, and later, Mo Farah, the Somali-born Briton, who won four Olympic gold medals and then left the Oregon Project in 2017. Both Rupp and Farah have denied using performance enhancing drugs. Even as those stars succeeded,others left the Oregon Project dispirited, their bodies broken and their minds damaged by Salazar’s intense workouts and coaching style. For more than a decade the Oregon Project operated largely in secrecy. The wall of silence began to break 10 years ago, when a Nike scientist called USADA to report suspicious testosterone levels in blood tests of Oregon Project athletes. Three years later, an Oregon Project scientist and coach, Steve Magness, left and began to speak publicly about experiments with testosterone and L-carnitine infusions that were in excess of antidoping limits. Kara Goucher, the former Olympian who trained with Salazar for seven years, spoke of how Salazar pushed athletes to take prescription drugs that were unnecessary but had side effects that might prove beneficial to endurance athletes. In testimony at his arbitration hearing, Salazar acknowledged distributing prescription drugs. “I was a part of a culture that was so manipulative and so controlling and so wrong,” Goucher said in an interview last week. “Your entire life is dependent on the power of this brand.”

0~Trump, in Taped Call, Pressured Georgia Official to ‘Find’ Votes to Overturn Election~As he did when he urged Mr. Zelensky to “do us a favor,” Mr. Trump on Saturday pleaded with Mr. Raffensperger to help him politically. The results of the 2020 race are expected to be certified by Congress during a session on Wednesday despite efforts by some of Mr. Trump’s allies in the House and the Senate, who have said they will challenge the results in several states, including Georgia. Mr. Trump said he hoped Mr. Raffensperger’s office could address his claimed discrepancies before Tuesday’s Senate runoff election in Georgia, one that will decide the balance of power in the Senate. The president is slated to campaign on Monday night in Georgia for the two Republican incumbents, Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. “I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election,” Mr. Trump said. Otherwise, he said, “you’re going to have people just not voting.” “They don’t want to vote,” he said. “They hate the state. They hate the governor and they hate the secretary of state.” He added: “The people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you’ve recalculated.” Mr. Raffensperger politely but firmly rejected the president’s entreaties, standing by the election results in his state and repeatedly insisting that Mr. Trump and his allies had been given false information about voter fraud. “Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong,” he said. Legal experts said Mr. Trump might have violated Georgia state laws against solicitation of voter fraud and extortion by seeking to exert pressure on Mr. Raffensperger.

0~Eugene Goodman and other officers will receive the Congressional Gold Medal for their actions on Jan. 6.~Among the harrowing images presented during the impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump, one video stood out: a Capitol Police officer sprinting toward a senator to warn of the angry mob nearby. The senator, Mitt Romney of Utah, is shown turning on his heels and fleeing to safety. “I don’t think my family or my wife understood that I was as close as I might have been to real danger,” Mr. Romney told reporters on Thursday, one day after the video showed Officer Eugene Goodman aiding him. “They were surprised and very, very appreciative of Officer Goodman, in his being there and directing me back to safety.” For Officer Goodman, it was the second time a video went viral displaying actions widely credited with saving members of Congress. The first, which showed him single-handedly luring the mob away from the entrance to the Senate toward an area with reinforcements, turned him into a hero. The second has added to his lore.
0~Dollar Stores Hit a Pandemic Downturn~Sandra Beadling was fed up with the 70-hour workweeks, the delivery trucks running days behind schedule, and the wear and tear on her knees from all the stooping to restock the bottom shelves. The manager of the Dollar General store in Wells, Maine, Ms. Beadling, 54, had tried to hire more help. But that was a tough sell when Walmart was offering $16 an hour and her store was paying $12. Ms. Beadling had spent long stretches this summer as one of only a few workers in the store, tending to the register and trying to help shoppers. She had pleaded with her managers to allow the store’s part-time workers to have more hours, but to no avail. One night last month, Ms. Beadling closed up the Dollar General at 10, got home at 11:30 and then left her house at 4 a.m. to be back at the store for an inventory check. “I was so tired I couldn’t find words,” she said. She sent her assistant manager a text saying she had quit and then blocked her co-workers’ numbers so they couldn’t call back and persuade her to stay.
0~Feed the Hungry? You’ll Need a Permit for That.~Like cities across the country, Newark — New Jersey’s biggest city, with a population of 311,000 — has seen homelessness worsen during the pandemic. The nonprofit that the city contracts with to do homeless outreach, Bridges, has tallied 1,366 people who have spent an unsheltered night so far this year. The equivalent figure in New York City, which has nearly 30 times as many residents as Newark, would be about 37,000 unsheltered people, far higher than any estimate of New York’s street-homeless population. Under Mr. Baraka, the city has taken steps to reduce homelessness. He created an office of homeless services last year and appointed a former Bridges official, Sakinah Hoyte, to be the city’s homelessness czar. This year, the city opened a housing facility called Hope Village, made from converted shipping containers, which is designed to help transition people who live in and around the train station into permanent housing. The city is converting a former schoolhouse into another shelter and housing-services center. It was in the context of these new programs that Ms. Hoyte sent out a “public feeding letter” on Nov. 19 announcing an outright ban on giving food to homeless people in public areas. “Feeding people in parks doesn’t encourage any sort of transitioning folks into housing,” Ms. Hoyte said in an interview. “It keeps people living on sidewalks and sleeping outside.” She said the city welcomed relief groups offering homeless people emergency supplies like warm clothes and helping connect them to social services, but that public feeding should not be part of the picture. To City Relief’s chief program officer, Josiah Haken, this approach seemed backward: Offering people food where they are, he said, is often the first step to getting them off the street.
0~Biden Promises 100 Million Vaccine Shots in 100 Days, but Shortage Worries Rise~The administration is now seeking to double the pre-order; otherwise it will run out of Pfizer’s vaccine by around March, according to people familiar with the talks. But Pfizer may not be able deliver more doses for Americans until as late as June because the company signed deals with other governments, including the European Union, as the Trump administration hesitated. Pfizer, an American company, could face a consumer backlash if countries in Europe or elsewhere are using its vaccine to save lives while Americans are forced to wait. But Trump administration officials, trying to hedge their bets among six vaccine makers, were unwilling to commit too heavily to Pfizer. Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., is close behind Pfizer and could win authorization for its vaccine this month. Like Pfizer’s, its federal contract calls for it to deliver 100 million doses by the end of the first quarter. Both vaccines require two doses, so together those supplies would presumably cover 100 million Americans by the spring. Moderna has said it expects to produce at least another 400 million doses next year, but it is unclear how many the U.S. government could claim. At a vaccine “summit” Tuesday at the White House, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that he said would “ensure that the United States government prioritizes the getting out of the vaccine to American citizens before sending it to other nations.” But the order appeared to have little teeth. Mr. Trump also said he would invoke the Defense Production Act to produce additional vaccine but did not say how.
0~Review: ‘Hamilton,’ Young Rebels Changing History and Theater~Yes, it really is that good. At this point, it would be almost a relief to report that “Hamilton” — the musical that opened at the Richard Rodgers Theater on Thursday night — has shrunk beneath the bloat of its hype. Since it was first staged at the Public Theater this year, this brave new show about America’s founding fathers has been given the kind of worshipful press usually reserved for the appearances of once-in-a-lifetime comets or the births of little royal celebrities. During the past several months, while it was being pumped up and trimmed down for its move from the East Village to Broadway, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s rap-driven portrait of the rise and fall of Alexander Hamilton (this country’s first secretary of the Treasury) has been the stuff of encomiums in both fashion magazines and op-ed columns. A friend of mine recently said that there were three subjects she never wanted to see in a newspaper again: Caitlyn Jenner, the Harper Lee novel “Go Set a Watchman” and “Hamilton.” Even I, one of the many critics who enthused about “Hamilton” in February like a born-again convert in a revival tent, was beginning to think, “Enough already.” Then I saw the show at the Richard Rodgers.
0~Flat Sales of Wii U Put Nintendo in the Hot Seat~TOKYO — Nintendo said on Wednesday that poor sales of the Wii U game console had caused a big drop in revenue in the first nine months of its financial year, adding pressure on the company to execute a strategic turnaround. Nintendo has resisted the advance of the smartphone, an increasingly popular platform for video game players, refusing to license popular games like the Mario franchise for mobile use. Instead, it has stuck to console systems, seeking to integrate its own hardware with video game software. But that is a shrinking business, and Nintendo is losing ground to two bigger rivals, Microsoft and Sony, which released new versions of their game consoles late last year. Nintendo, which is based in Kyoto, Japan, said revenue in the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, or through December, fell to 499 billion yen, or $4.83 billion, from ¥543 billion a year earlier.
0~Is the Supreme Court Clueless About Corruption? Ask Jack Abramoff~He should know. Once a man with gold-plated Republican connections and easy access to the White House and Capitol leadership suites, Mr. Abramoff and his partners were masters of spreading favors around Washington. They parceled out tickets to major sporting events, escorted influential officials on all-expenses-paid golf junkets, paid the tabs for lavish dinners and cozied up to politicians at Signatures, a restaurant Mr. Abramoff once owned on Pennsylvania Avenue. All the while they were soliciting and obtaining help on issues ranging from gambling to wages to tax policy. It all came crashing down ignominiously in January 2006, when Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud and tax offenses, ending his career and landing members of his inner circle behind bars with him. Dealings with Mr. Abramoff also sent Bob Ney, a former Republican representative from Ohio, to the penitentiary and contributed to the downfall of Tom DeLay of Texas, the powerful No. 2 House Republican. Mr. Abramoff, now chastened and repentant, spent nearly four years in prison. Since his release, he has spoken out against the dangers of what he says is an inherently corrupt system where financial aid and other perks are provided to politicians who only naturally take care of benefactors they consider friends. “People come to think those seeking favors and giving you things are your friends, your buddies,” he said, remembering his own days as an insider. “Human nature is such that your natural inclination is, ‘He has done something for me, what can I do for him?’ The minute that has crept into the public service discussion, that is a problem.”
0~John McCain, War Hero, Senator, Presidential Contender, Dies at 81~“We’re getting nothing done, my friends. We’re getting nothing done.” It was a few days before the historic Obamacare repeal vote, and Republicans desperately needed John McCain. “It was a dramatic and consequential return for John McCain to the Senate floor.” “What a dramatic morning this is turning out to be, with John McCain making that surprise return to Washington.” “And McCain’s vote is going to give leadership a lot more breathing room.” But the maverick of the Senate had just been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and he was playing hard to get. “We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues, because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.” But would he vote with his party, or would he defect? “I will not vote for this bill as it is today.” This was the kind of moment that John McCain lives for. He is going to be the deciding vote, and he’s got control of a major piece of legislation in his hand. “You heard John McCain. A really historic moment. Trying to set a new tone when it comes to fixing our health care system.” When you go against the grain in Washington, you get a lot of attention. “Shutting down the government injured the people of my state. Why? Why would we want to do that?” John McCain had a big ego, and he liked the attention. But also, I do think that the maverick aspect to McCain was real. He saw a lot of the things that went on in Washington as semi-idiotic, or corrupt. “I think the Congress of the United States — both Republicans and Democrats — should be ashamed of themselves. These may be worthy projects. They may be. Generally they aren’t. How many more lawmakers, staffers, government officials, and contractors have to go to jail before we actually fix this process?” He liked challenging authority. It may be part of that is just growing up in a military family and having all that military experience, where you’re subject to so much authority. “I have trouble with this. More than two-syllable words —” In the political phase of his life, he was willing to step up, take a chance, and shake up the system. “Eleven million people live in the shadows, and they live here in de facto amnesty, and, by God, they are being exploited every single day.” Of course, he switched back and forth when it suited his politics. “We will secure the borders first when I am president of the United States. I am proud that Republicans are the party of lower taxes. I cannot in good conscience vote in favor of tax cuts.” There have been so many John McCains over the years. He came to Congress as this exalted war hero who’d already had a national reputation because of his time as a P.O.W. in Vietnam. McCain was shot down, held for years in terrible conditions in the Hanoi Hilton. He had a high profile because of his father. “The commander in chief of our Pacific forces, Admiral John S. McCain Jr.” “As you know, we are living in a troubled world —” They knew that they had something of a celebrity prisoner there. He was tortured, subjected to really unthinkable experiences. He resisted and resisted, but ultimately did make a confession. That really haunted him through the rest of his life. He felt that he had caved and betrayed his country. When he returned from Vietnam, to much acclaim, he was an ambitious guy, and he quickly turned to politics. “John McCain, a name Arizonans are talking about.” He ran for the House. Came in as a pretty conventional conservative — somebody who wanted to get on board the Reagan Revolution. “Speaker, like a poor fellow who brought his horse to water but could not make it drink, Walter Mondale proposes to throw more tax money at the deficit with little chance of making it shrink.” But there was a watershed moment coming for John McCain — “— a major congressional scandal —” The Keating Five Scandal. “Charles Keating, a millionaire banker who has come to embody the savings and loan scandal —” A group of senators — a bipartisan group — had interceded on behalf of a big businessman, and they tried to help him out of a regulatory problem. It was a big scandal at the moment, because the S&L crisis was huge back then. “Do you swear under oath to this committee you were unaware of that at the time?” McCain was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing. “But I understand why the committee made the arrangements they did.” He thought it be besmirched his honor, which is probably the most important thing to John McCain besides his family, is his honor. This was a searing experience for McCain, and it really helped shape his later image as a maverick, because he immediately became someone, I think, who wanted to shake up the system and rein in the influence of money and politics. “There’s too much money washing around, and this money makes good people do bad things, and bad people do worse things.” John McCain was ready to do that. His party really wasn’t. They liked the campaign system the way it was, particularly Mitch McConnell. “To effectively discuss issues in this country, one must have access to money.” He was the leading foe of John McCain. “Who do you want to be the next president of these United States? McCain! That’s right.” So McCain had presidential ambitions. 2000 seemed like a good opportunity for him. This was the year of the famous Straight Talk Express. He was really letting it hang out in a lot of ways. “If I were a tree, I would be a —” “If I were a tree, I would be a root. What does that mean? I’d be glad to tell you —” But he ran into a real buzzsaw with the Bush family and Karl Rove. “Let me finish. Let me finish.” “All right, then.” The Bush campaign did some really tough negative advertising. “McCain’s campaign is crawling with lobbyists.” “His conservative hometown paper warns — It’s time the rest of the nation learns about the McCain we know.” McCain was stung when he came back to the Senate, you could tell. “Gentlemen —” “Senator John McCain, the Republican, and Senator Barack Obama, the —” In 2008, this was really John McCain’s last opportunity. He took the nomination, but he was really in trouble from the start. Obama, the celebrity candidate, the economic collapse — “The fundamentals of our economy are strong —” — picking Sarah Palin as his running mate. “This is absolutely overwhelming.” People really questioned John McCain’s judgment on that. Even at the end, McCain was still fighting the leaders of his party. “Yesterday, I received a call from President Putin of Russia —” Being cozy with the Russians, pulling back in Asia. To John McCain, this was anathema. He wouldn’t mention Trump by name, but he would talk about failures of American foreign policy and the conduct. “— refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.” This was amped up more after the diagnosis of brain cancer. I think that was also part of his vote on the health care repeal. At the climactic moment, he walked out onto the floor, turned thumbs down, and killed the repeal effort. It was one of his last big acts as a U.S. senator. “Making news in the 11th hour —” “The resistance to President Trump had its biggest victory yet.” “This is a major defeat.” “You could look at this one moment like a Renaissance painting.” “It was unbelievable.” McCain wasn’t going to go quietly.
0~Fed Suggests Tough Road Ahead as It Pledges to Help Insulate Economy~He highlighted the need for fiscal policies that protect businesses and households from “avoidable insolvency.” The Fed’s announcement came just hours after a government report showed that the economy contracted at a 4.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. While that was the worst reading since 2008 and ended the record-long expansion, it probably barely scraped the surface of the coronavirus damage. Lockdowns started only toward the end of the quarter. The contraction is expected to look even worse in the three months through June, but what will happen after that remains extremely uncertain. States and cities are tiptoeing toward a reopening, but that process could take months. It is also unclear when consumers will feel comfortable enough to return to shopping malls and concerts, let alone travel for work or pleasure. Fed officials warned that the economy may be in for an unsteady journey back to growth and prosperity. Mr. Powell said second-quarter economic data would be “worse” than anything previously seen, that it might take consumers time to feel comfortable spending again, and that companies and workers might need additional financial help. In their post-meeting release, Fed officials flagged “considerable risks to the economic outlook” over the medium term, suggesting central bank officials did not anticipate growth to bounce back quickly in the “V-shaped” recovery that President Trump and some other administration officials still seemed to expect. “They are giving some insight into how they see the trajectory for the economy, which is not a V-shaped path,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. “They’ll keep interest rates low for a long time, they’ll err on the side of being more accommodative, rather than less.”

0~Charlie Hebdo, French Magazine, Firebombed~PARIS — The office of a French satirical magazine here was badly damaged by a firebomb early on Wednesday, the publisher said, after it published a spoof issue “guest edited” by the Prophet Muhammad to salute the victory of an Islamist party in Tunisian elections. The publication also said hackers had disrupted its Web site. The magazine, Charlie Hebdo, had announced a special issue for publication Wednesday, renamed “Charia Hebdo,” a play on the word in French for Shariah law. The magazine’s editor, Stephane Charbonnier, told Europe 1 radio that the police had called just before 5 a.m. to report a fire of criminal origin. News reports said a Molotov cocktail had been thrown through a window. The special edition was on its way to the newsstands, the editor said, and will appear as scheduled.
0~‘The Crown’ Stokes an Uproar Over Fact vs. Entertainment~Mr. Neil, who went on to be a broadcaster and publisher, is no reflexive defender of the royal family. Suspicious of Britain’s class system, he said he had sympathies for the republican movement in the 1980s. But he grew to admire how the queen modernized the monarchy after the upheaval of those years, and has been critical of renegade royals, like Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan. The events involving Mr. Neil did happen: The queen became frustrated with Mrs. Thatcher when she refused to join the 48 other members of the British Commonwealth in backing sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. This highly unusual clash spilled into public when The Sunday Times published its front-page report, attributed to palace officials, which said the royal family viewed Mrs. Thatcher as “uncaring, confrontational and socially divisive.” But Mr. Neil disputed several elements of “The Crown’s” retelling, not least that Buckingham Palace made the queen’s press secretary, Michael Shea, the scapegoat for the incident. The show depicts his being fired for having leaked the story, even though it suggests that he did so at the queen’s behest. There is no evidence of this, Mr. Neil said, but it fits Mr. Morgan’s “left-wing agenda.” “He gets to depict Thatcher as pretty much an ally of apartheid while the queen is the sort of person who junks loyal flunkies when things go wrong, even when they are just doing her bidding,” Mr. Neil said. The brickbats are not just from the right. Simon Jenkins, a columnist for the left-leaning Guardian, regards members of the royal family as artifacts of celebrity culture irrelevant to a country grappling with real-world challenges like Brexit. “They are practically defunct,” he said. “They are like anthropomorphized figures of a head of state.” Yet he, too, is angered by how “The Crown” portrayed the events of the 1980s, when, as political editor of The Economist, he wrote about how Prince Charles had been drawn to the now-defunct Social Democratic Party. (He based the report on an off-the-record interview with the prince.) Mr. Jenkins said that because this season of “The Crown” deals with contemporary history and people who are still alive, its liberties with the facts are less a case of artistic license than an example of “fake news.”
0~Democrats Buoyed by Abortion and Trump, Times/Siena Poll Finds~The survey underscored how Republicans have been weakened by Mr. Trump’s decision to play a vocal role in his party’s primaries. Voters said that the word “extreme” described the Republicans better than the Democrats by a six-point margin, 43 to 37 percent. And, although they deemed economic issues most important, more voters said that Democrats were focused on the most important issues than said that Republicans were, by 40 to 38 percent. While the poll did not directly ask voters how Mr. Trump weighed on their midterm vote, it found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump by three percentage points, 45 to 42 percent, in a hypothetical 2024 matchup — nearly identical to voter preferences in the race for Congress. In contrast, voters trust the Republicans more on the economy by a 14-point margin, 52 to 38 percent. And they say that economic issues will matter more to their vote than do societal issues by an 18-point margin. Yet 9 percent of the voters who trust Republicans more on economic issues and say that those issues are most important are voting for Democrats, anyway. How Times reporters cover politics.

Jeanine Spanjers, 44, from Racine, Wis., said that rising inflation had caused her to change her lifestyle, including driving less, skipping vacations and even abstaining from popcorn when she goes to the movies. A state employee, she also said she believed that Democrats were handing out too many government subsidies, pointing to relief payments distributed during the pandemic. “What’s getting on my nerves is all this free stuff,” she said, criticizing how all the children at her son’s school received food stamp cards, including families who could afford to pay for lunch. “Republicans would never do something like that. It disincentivizes people to go out and do something. I’m starting to feel like people are being rewarded for not doing anything.”
0~Start-Up Funding Falls the Most It Has Since 2019~SAN FRANCISCO — For the first time in three years, start-up funding is dropping. The numbers are stark. Investments in U.S. tech start-ups plunged 23 percent over the last three months, to $62.3 billion, the steepest fall since 2019, according to figures released on Thursday by PitchBook, which tracks young companies. Even worse, in the first six months of the year, start-up sales and initial public offerings — the primary ways these companies return cash to investors — plummeted 88 percent, to $49 billion, from a year ago. The declines are a rarity in the start-up ecosystem, which enjoyed more than a decade of outsize growth fueled by a booming economy, low interest rates and people using more and more technology, from smartphones to apps to artificial intelligence. That surge produced now-household names such as Airbnb and Instacart. Over the past decade, quarterly funding to high growth start-ups fell just seven times. But as rising interest rates, inflation and uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine have cast a pall over the global economy this year, young tech companies have gotten hit. And that foreshadows a difficult period for the tech industry, which relies on start-ups in Silicon Valley and beyond to provide the next big innovation and growth engine. “We’ve been in a long bull market,” said Kirsten Green, an investor with Forerunner Ventures, adding that the pullback was partly a reaction to that frenzied period of dealmaking, as well as to macroeconomic uncertainty. “What we’re doing right now is calming things down and cutting out some of the noise.”
0~Germany’s New Hunger for Coal Dooms a Tiny Village~LÜTZERATH, Germany — For months, die-hard environmental activists have camped in the fields and occupied the trees in this tiny farming village in western Germany, hoping that like-minded people from across the country would arrive and help stop the expansion of a nearby open-pit coal mine that threatened to swallow the village and its farms. They had reason to be optimistic. Mass protests led the German government to step in and save an old-growth forest from coal expansion just two years ago. And the Green party notched its best showing ever in elections last year, a sign of how fighting climate change had become a winning political issue in Europe’s largest economy. “If there were 50,000 on the street, politicians would have to do something,” said Eckardt Heukamp, 58, the last farmer remaining in Lützerath, who put up some of the protesters in apartments on his property. Others built tree houses, pitched tents or moved into abandoned houses in the village. But the hoped-for surge in protesters never materialized. And last week, the government effectively sealed Lützerath’s fate by announcing that RWE, Germany’s largest energy company, needed the coal under the village — to make up for gas that had stopped flowing in from Russia.
0~GERMAN STRIKE SLOWING EUROPEAN AUTO OUTPUT~Opel, G.M.'s German unit, said a transmission plant near Vienna was forced to close today, and assembly of the Corsa, a front-wheel-drive subcompact car built at a factory in Saragossa, Spain, would be threatened early next month. Assembly lines at three Opel factories in Germany and one in Antwerp, Belgium, have been stopped by the strike since May 22. An Opel official said the production shortfall was costing about $22 million a day. Ford Turns to Other Plants Officials at Ford Werke, Ford's West German unit, say the company has thus far been able to keep its German plants running by drawing on parts from its factories in other European countries. But officials said the auto maker would be forced by dwindling parts supplies to close plants in Germany and Belgium next Wednesday if the strike continued. Volkswagen, Germany's biggest auto maker, said on Tuesday that it was closing six factories in Germany and one in Belgium, effective today, halting production of about 5,000 cars a day. Two factories of VW's Audi subsidiary in Germany have been shut down since May 18. Evidently to play down the effects of the strike, a VW official said that most of the company's 110,000 workers had been sent on a one-week enforced vacation. But he acknowledged that only about half of the employees would resume work when plants reopen next Monday.
0~Jeffrey Epstein Settles Lawsuit, Avoiding Testimony From Accusers in Sex Case~MIAMI — With sexual abuse allegations from dozens of girls in Florida back in the national spotlight more than a decade after they first surfaced, Jeffrey E. Epstein, a wealthy New York financier, unexpectedly settled a civil case against him on Tuesday, a last-minute development to avoid a trial that could have brought some of his accusers to testify about their trauma for the first time. The courthouse in West Palm Beach, Fla., was set for a legal drama to play out as jury selection was scheduled to begin in the trial, which drew so many news reporters that the case was moved to a larger courtroom. Instead, in an unusual written apology delivered by one of his lawyers, Mr. Epstein admitted to wrongfully suing Bradley Edwards, a lawyer for some of his accusers, who had sued Mr. Epstein for malicious prosecution. “The lawsuit I filed was my unreasonable attempt to damage his business reputation and stop Mr. Edwards from pursuing cases against me,” Mr. Epstein, 65, said in the statement read by his lawyer, Scott J. Link. “It did not work.” The confidential financial settlement between Mr. Epstein and Mr. Edwards will allow Mr. Edwards to continue to pursue a case in federal court on behalf of Mr. Epstein’s accusers. That case seeks to nullify a controversial nonprosecution agreement made in secret in 2007 that allowed Mr. Epstein to avoid federal criminal charges, despite police findings that Mr. Epstein had lured girls — some of them runaways or foster children — to his Palm Beach mansion to give him massages that frequently turned sexual.
0~Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan Officials Profit From It~The system in Garmsir, however, appears to leave little to chance. The district, farther from the provincial capital than Marja or Nad Ali, enjoys more autonomy than most under government control. Interviews conducted in mid-March, before the blight appeared, showed a system of accommodation that was settling in comfortably. While farmers were not happy about paying the government, most saw it as inevitable and noted that the profit margin for opium was still considerably better than for wheat or cotton. “We understand that the officials will charge us money,” said Juma Khan, a 35-year-old farmer in Garmsir, shrugging. The system ran into turbulence in the spring, when two members of Parliament caught wind of the arrangement. After their demand for a cut of the profits was rebuffed, they went public, according to Afghan officials familiar with the case. Officials in Kabul quickly fired the district governor, police chief and intelligence director, who were accused of dividing the profits. In a small ceremony, the Helmand deputy governor returned wads of cash to cheering farmers outside the provincial governor’s offices and promised to crack down on such exploitation. Officials said that all of the money had been returned to farmers and that the responsible parties had been removed from power. But neither promise was entirely true. The governor of Garmsir — who, in an interview, denied that he had created or collected any tax — was quietly moved to Washir, a neighboring district. Months later, he was moved back to Garmsir, where he has returned to his old job. Government officials in Kabul said he had been cleared of wrongdoing after a thorough investigation. A later visit to Garmsir unearthed a second inconsistency: Farmers said they had received only half of their money back. Still, that was something of a rebate. After all, they had lost nearly half of their crop to blight.
0~Researchers find a higher than expected risk of myocarditis in young men after full vaccination.~Males between 16 and 29 years of age have an increased risk of developing heart problems after receiving a second dose of coronavirus vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna, according to a large new analysis published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, conducted in Israel, estimated that nearly 11 of every 100,000 males in that age group developed myocarditis, inflammation of the heart, a few days after having been fully vaccinated. That figure is higher than most earlier estimates. Boys between 16 and 19 years of age had the highest incidence of myocarditis after the second dose, according to a second study in the journal. The risk of heart problems in boys of that age was about nine times higher than in unvaccinated boys of the same age. The absolute risk is still very small, and the condition temporary. And studies have shown that Covid-19 is much more likely to cause heart problems compared with vaccination.
0~Citing Recusal, Trump Says He Wouldn’t Have Hired Sessions~WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he never would have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, calling the decision “very unfair to the president.” [Read excerpts of The Times’s interview with President Trump.] In a remarkable public break with one of his earliest political supporters, Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Sessions’s decision ultimately led to the appointment of a special counsel that should not have happened. “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,” Mr. Trump said. In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, the president also accused James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in May, of trying to leverage a dossier of compromising material to keep his job. Mr. Trump criticized both the acting F.B.I. director who has been filling in since Mr. Comey’s dismissal and the deputy attorney general who recommended it. And he took on Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel now leading the investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election. Mr. Trump said Mr. Mueller was running an office rife with conflicts of interest and warned investigators against delving into matters too far afield from Russia. Mr. Trump never said he would order the Justice Department to fire Mr. Mueller, nor would he outline circumstances under which he might do so. But he left open the possibility as he expressed deep grievance over an investigation that has taken a political toll in the six months since he took office.
0~In S. Carolina, a Vote Not to Impeach Gov. Sanford~Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina may have lost his wife after his tearful confession that he had traveled to Argentina as part of a yearlong extramarital affair, but he almost certainly will not lose his office. The state House Judiciary Committee voted, 18 to 6, on Wednesday to kill a resolution to impeach the embattled governor, less than a week after his wife, Jenny Sanford, announced that she had filed for divorce on grounds of adultery. She waited until after a special panel of lawmakers said last week that it would recommend against impeachment. Governor Sanford, 49, a Republican, issued a statement after the committee vote thanking the committee for its “deliberative approach” and “reasonable decision.” “As we’ve consistently said, this administration has tried to be a stalwart ally of the taxpayer, and will remain so for the next 13 months,” he said.
0~God Looked Like Marx~PERSEPOLIS By Marjane Satrapi. Translated by Mattias Ripa and Blake Ferris. Illustrated. 153 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $17.95. Marjane Satrapi's ''Persepolis'' is the latest and one of the most delectable examples of a booming postmodern genre: autobiography by comic book. All over the world, ambitious artist-writers have been discovering that the cartoons on which they were raised make the perfect medium for exploring consciousness, the ideal shortcut -- via irony and gallows humor -- from introspection to the grand historical sweep. It's no coincidence that one of the most provocative American takes on Sept. 11 has been Art Spiegelman's. Like Spiegelman's ''Maus,'' Satrapi's book combines political history and memoir, portraying a country's 20th-century upheavals through the story of one family. Her protagonist is Marji, a tough, sassy little Iranian girl, bent on prying from her evasive elders if not truth, at least a credible explanation of the travails they are living through. Marji, born like her author in 1969, grows up in a fashionably radical household in Tehran. Her father is an engineer; her feminist mother marches in demonstrations against the shah; Marji, an only child, attends French lycée. Satrapi is sly at exposing the hypocrisies of Iran's bourgeois left: when Marji's father discovers to his outrage that their maid is in love with the neighbors' son, he busts up the romance, intoning, ''In this country you must stay within your own social class.'' Marji sneaks into the weeping girl's bedroom to comfort her, reflecting, deadpan, ''We were not in the same social class but at least we were in the same bed.'' Marji finds her own solution, in religion, to the problem of social injustice. ''I wanted to be a prophet . . . because our maid did not eat with us. Because my father had a Cadillac. And, above all, because my grandmother's knees always ached.'' The book is full of bittersweet drawings of Marji's tête-à-têtes with God, who resembles Marx, ''though Marx's hair was a bit curlier.'' In upper-middle-class Tehran in 1976, piety is taken as a sign of mental imbalance: Marji's teacher summons her parents to discuss the child's worrying psychological state.
0~Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution Isn’t Over Yet~Chow plans on stepping down as the head of the H.K.F.S. next month; Lester Shum will be stepping down as well. In the meantime, Chow and Shum can’t walk down the street in Hong Kong without being recognized. Some people grin and give them thumbs up, though occasionally people will scold them. “It matters,” Lau said, “although the movement is not successful because the government didn’t yield to any of our requests.” The importance of the movement, he explained, was to show that Hong Kong could do more. “All these protests that you guys find normal in the States or Europe or France, Hong Kong people detested it. They thought, We cannot have this kind of chaos in Hong Kong, we are an economic city.” The end of Occupy did not entirely snuff out the Umbrella Revolution. As soon as the camps closed down, other, smaller protests started popping up around the city. A group of activists hung a yellow banner on a cliff face known as Lion Rock, and the police had to use a helicopter to get it down. Nightly crowds gathered in Mong Kok, and as Christmas approached, groups of singers roamed the streets, singing protest songs to the tune of carols, like “O Come All Ye Faithful”: Everyone has head injuries and bloody limbs Everyone has a long scar from a healing wound on their forehead Evil police angrily wave their batons, hoping to kill a few pedestrians The first large-scale protest since the occupation was held on Feb. 1, organized by the Civil Human Rights Front. They marched peacefully, carrying the familiar yellow umbrellas of the movement, but with just an estimated 13,000 people, the crowd was smaller than expected. “Maybe this is a not a negative thing,” Chow told me. The diversity of opinions that he had struggled with in the protest zone could be a source of strength in Hong Kong’s post-Occupy movement. Members of H.K.F.S. argued that each small act of protest would keep the movement going. For the students in the First Defensive Line, the movement didn’t change their daily lives, but it changed them. I met up with a few of them at a Häagen-Dazs in Mong Kok a few days after the protest. Jodi had a yellow ribbon pinned just beneath her scarf. “We didn’t successfully fight for what we wanted,” she said. “But more and more teenagers will think more about the government and society, and one day we will have some success. Not this month or next year. I believe it will be a long fight.” “I met a new family here,” Wing Sham said. Marco, who was leaning back in his chair, his hands stuffed in his jacket pockets, let everyone else finish before he spoke. “Before the movement, I was a normal teenager who stayed at home without any meaning,” he told the table. “I believe I will join more social care work and care about society.” The next measurable step for the Hong Kong protests happens in the legislature, where the constitutional reforms required to change Hong Kong’s electoral system have to come to a vote. In a mechanism that still limits Beijing’s power in the city, any change to the way the chief executive is elected requires a two-thirds majority in LegCo. Hong Kong’s pan-democratic leaders have pledged to veto the measure — a symbolic gesture, Anson Chan told me, but one that will at least keep the question of democracy in the air. “You can’t treat the young people in Hong Kong as if their minds are a blank sheet of paper on which you can write at will,” she said. “The young people through this Umbrella Revolution have demonstrated that they have a mind of their own. Furthermore, they are no longer politically apathetic,” she said. “They’re prepared to stand up and be counted.”
0~As Virus Cases Surge, New Yorkers Feel a Familiar Anxiety~An average of more than 10,600 infections were being identified each day in New York State, more than any other state, and hospitalizations were also increasing, although more slowly. The city’s test positivity rate doubled in just three days, up to 7.8 percent on Sunday compared with 3.9 percent the previous Thursday, raising alarm bells among city officials and residents alike. The number of new cases reported statewide on Thursday alone — 18,276, more than 8,300 of them in New York City — was the highest since at least January. Hospitalizations, though, remain at a fraction of what they were in the city’s deadly first virus wave, with about 1,000 people hospitalized in New York City now, compared to more than 15,000 at the peak in April 2020. It remains unknown to what extent Omicron will cause serious illness. Scientists believe that vaccines will still provide protection against the worst outcomes, and boosters are likely to provide additional protection against infection, preliminary data suggests. The public health picture in other states was also growing bleaker. Connecticut is averaging more than 2,600 new cases a day, up from about 330 at the start of November, and Rhode Island is adding cases at the highest rate in the nation. Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania have the highest rates of coronavirus hospitalizations. In Rhode Island, Dr. Wilfredo Giordano-Perez, who sits on the governor’s vaccine committee, said the number of people scaling back holiday plans still seemed fairly small. “I wish I was hearing more of that,” he said. “I think people are going to take their chances, with this idea that they’ve done everything they can do up until this point.”
0~The Puzzling Popularity of Back Surgery in Certain Regions~Our best guess comes from a study by Harvard and Dartmouth researchers, not on back surgery, but on cardiac treatments. It found that regional variation in Medicare spending is associated with variation in physician preferences for intensity of cardiac treatments, and to a greater degree when the evidence is ambiguous. Patient preferences exerted almost no influence. It’s likely that the pattern holds for back surgery, too, though it has not been studied in the United States. It’s tempting to conclude that there are simply regions where the intensity of care of all types is higher — that some regions invest in all of the latest shiny technologies, while others don’t. This is too simple; Miami and McAllen, Tex., the two most expensive regions in the United States for overall Medicare spending, also clock in with among the lowest spine surgery rates. Instead, we see what Mr. Wennberg calls a surgical signature: Casper Wyo., has the highest back surgery rate in the country, but its cardiac bypass surgery is well below the national average. This puzzling pattern once again points toward idiosyncratic physician beliefs. Orthopedic surgeons in a particular hospital may be more aggressive, while the cardiologists there are less so. Though we can’t say this is the answer with 100 percent certainty, we can rule out some other explanations. One is how much surgeons are paid. Since Medicare pays the same price for the procedure (adjusted for cost of living) across the country, prices can’t explain the paradox. The high rates in Denver could also be explained by back pain sufferers who flock to star surgeons and well-known hospitals there, but this doesn’t hold water either. The way the statistics are compiled, if a medical tourist traveled from Des Moines to Denver, the Medicare record keepers would assign that operation back to the tourist’s home in Iowa. Maybe it’s differences in health. Perhaps areas with rapid growth in back surgery were those where more people had back pain. Yet northern New England retirees had similar histories of hard physical labor in farming, lumbering and manufacturing, and were no more affluent than their counterparts in the Northern Plains states. Another explanation might be that patients prefer surgery in some regions of the country. One study observed large variations in back surgery across small regions in Ontario, but these weren’t explained by patient preferences. That study, like others, found physician beliefs about the benefits of surgery were associated with surgical variations. If physicians are driving back treatment choice, even for procedures not supported by evidence, what can be done? One approach is to provide patients with unbiased information about the potential benefits and risks of back surgery relative to nonsurgical therapy so they can make informed choices. But the concern remains that for people in intense pain, when the doctor says that “I get good results with surgery, and my patients generally feel much better,” the back surgery option, with little out-of-pocket cost, will be hard to resist.
0~Delta Surge Drives Home Painful Truth: Covid Isn’t Going Away~About 130,000 cases are being reported across America each day, almost twice as many as last summer’s highest levels. Even as some of the first hot spots of this summer, including Missouri and Nevada, show glimmers of progress, much of the country continues to see explosive case growth. During the latest surge, the United States is armed with vaccines that are highly effective in preventing severe illness and death, and are available to anyone 12 years and older. But only about half of Americans are fully vaccinated, and daily vaccination rates have risen only modestly, to about 700,000 doses a day, since the Delta surge began. The worst surges have so far been concentrated in Southern states with underwhelming vaccination numbers, but infections have also been rising in places with far better vaccine uptake. Oregon and Hawaii, both of which have relatively high vaccination rates, have set weekly case records in recent days, and daily case rates have more than doubled in recent weeks in highly vaccinated parts of New England. Whether cases there eventually reach Louisiana-like levels will be seen as a test of whether vaccinations can make a significant difference on not just the number of deaths but in the size and strength of surges. Most of the country remains fully open, and aside from Hawaii, where the governor recently imposed restrictions on social gatherings and restaurants, most officials have so far steered away from restricting or shuttering businesses, leaning instead on mask rules or vaccine requirements or, more commonly, nothing at all. Louisiana and Oregon have reinstated mask mandates. San Francisco will require proof of vaccination to patronize restaurants, bars and gyms. Several school districts and cities have returned to universal masking, while more employers and colleges have announced plans to require vaccines. In Jackson, Miss., Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba kept a mask mandate in place even after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in May that fully vaccinated people could go most places without masks, guidance it later reversed. In recent days, with cases in Mississippi reaching record levels and hospitalizations rising, he announced that municipal workers would soon have to submit proof of vaccination or be tested regularly. Mr. Lumumba said restrictions, including limits on businesses, were under consideration but have yet to be put in place.
0~Boris Johnson’s ‘Global Britain’ Makes Shaky Start at G7 Summit~The urgent need for vaccines was driven home by the announcement on Monday of Britain’s postponed reopening, caused by the spread of a variant known as Delta among the unvaccinated population. On Sunday evening, Mr. Johnson left Cornwall as soon as he saw off his guests so he could huddle with advisers in London over the latest scientific data on infections and hospitalizations. “When you’ve got a coronavirus raging around the world, one billion doses by next summer is not a deliverable worth mentioning,” said Jamie Drummond, who co-founded the advocacy group One with Bono, the lead singer of U2. “By next summer, it’s a death sentence for millions.” On climate change, where Mr. Johnson had promised a Marshall Plan-like effort to curb carbon emissions, the Group of 7 failed to a set a firm date to phase out coal-burning power plants, a primary contributor to global warming. The prime minister will get another chance to nail down commitments in November at the United Nations’ climate change conference in Glasgow. Still, it was not the failure to strike global deals that marred Mr. Johnson’s Group of 7; such deals are elusive at these meetings, no matter the host or the political atmosphere. It was the jarring intrusion of Northern Ireland into the proceedings. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Macron had a tense exchange over post-Brexit trade arrangements for the region. British officials are demanding that the European Union change the current system — designed to avoid new barriers between Ireland, an E.U. member state, and Northern Ireland — because it says that checks on some goods flowing from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland are driving a wedge between two parts of the United Kingdom. British newspapers reported that Mr. Macron suggested Northern Ireland was not part of the union. The French president said later he had never questioned “the integrity of the British territory” but insisted that Britain needed to abide by the terms of the deal it signed with the European Union in 2019.
0~Appeals Court Calls a Stop-and-Frisk Illegal~A state appellate court ruled on Tuesday that a New York City police officer who found a concealed handgun on a 14-year-old in the Bronx during a stop-and-frisk encounter in 2010 did not have sufficient cause to search him, and reversed his conviction. The decision, the latest legal attack on the New York Police Department’s large-scale frisking of people in crime-troubled neighborhoods, sharply divided a five-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court for the First Department, which covers Manhattan and the Bronx. The majority opinion in the 3-to-2 decision, written by Justice Peter Tom, said a Family Court judge had erred in finding that the arresting officer could frisk someone “under the guise that the officer claimed to perceive some threat to his personal safety.” The judges held that the lower court’s ruling would broadly expand the power of the police to frisk people.
0~Wall Street Sours on Whole Foods Market~Sales of organic and natural products are soaring — but you would never know it from the share price of Whole Foods Market, the premier purveyor of such merchandise. Shares are almost 50 percent lower than they were in February, the high point of the year. Investment analysts are almost uniformly negative on the company, worried that competition from mainstream retailers, which are increasing the amount of organic and natural items in their mix, will impede the growth of Whole Foods. Costco, for instance, claims to be the biggest seller of organic foods, and Walmart now sells Wild Oats, a brand of organic products, at the same price as similar conventional brands. “Conventional retailers can get it into their stores more cheaply, and they can be more predatory on pricing,” said Mark Retzloff, a pioneer of the natural and organic foods retail business. “If one of those stores is just down the street from a Whole Foods, there’s a big segment of their customer base that isn’t going to shop at Whole Foods anymore.”
0~Hundreds Arrested in Global Sting Using App Run by F.B.I.~The F.B.I.’s operation, according to court documents that the Justice Department unsealed on Monday, had its origins in early 2018 after the bureau dismantled a Canadian-based encryption service called Phantom Secure. That company, officials said, supplied encrypted cellphones to drug gangs, like Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, and other criminal groups. Seeing a void in the underground market, the F.B.I. recruited a former Phantom Secure distributor who had been developing a new encrypted communications system called Anom. The informant agreed to work for the F.B.I. and let the bureau control the network for the possibility of a reduced prison sentence, according to the court documents. The F.B.I. paid the informant $120,000, the documents said. Anom devices were cellphones that had been stripped of all normal functions. Their only working app was disguised as the calculator function: After entering a code, users could send messages and photos with end-to-end encryption. Over three years, more than 12,000 Anom devices were sold to over 300 criminal syndicates operating in more than 100 countries, according to Europol. The devices cost varied by location but were generally sold, court papers say, on six-month subscriptions available for $1,700 in the United States. Working with the Australian authorities, the F.B.I. and the informant developed a “master key” that allowed them to reroute the messages to a third country and decrypt them, ultimately intercepting more than 27 million messages. The authorities also relied on the informant to get the devices into the highly insular criminal networks. The informant started in October 2018 by offering the devices to three other distributors with connections to organized crime in Australia.

0~12-Year-Old Boy Dies After Police in Cleveland Shoot Him~Officials in Cleveland were investigating the police shooting of a 12-year-old boy who died on Sunday, a day after an officer shot him outside a recreation center when he reached for a weapon that turned out to be a fake pistol. The boy, Tamir E. Rice, died on Sunday at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, the Cuyahoga County medical examiner’s office said. He was shot in the torso at a park on Saturday after witnesses reported that he was waving a gun around and pointing it at people, the police said. Two police officers responded to the scene and ordered the boy to raise his hands, the police said, but he refused and reached for a gun in his waistband. An officer fired two shots, striking the boy once, the police said.
0~A NATION CHALLENGED: THE CAPTIVES; Prison Packed With Taliban Raises Concern~''We have a mission to process the detainees, and we are doing that as quickly as we can, while treating them with dignity and respect,'' said the commander of the operation, Col. Kevin Wilkerson of the Army's 10th Mountain Division. Human rights officials say the close involvement of United States forces with General Dostum and his officials means that the Americans have a responsibility to ensure good treatment of the prisoners. ''They are being held by the Afghan authorities, and the primary responsibility is theirs, but it is obvious that the more the U.S. and international community become involved, there is a responsibility to see the Afghans have the logistical resources and technical ability to ensure good treatment,'' said James Ross, a senior legal adviser at the New York-based Human Rights Watch. In Afghanistan, the United States Army is embarked on a long mission to register the prisoners and interrogate those who may be able to provide valuable information about Osama bin Laden's Qaeda terrorist network. Eighty-five of the prisoners in Shibarghan had been sent to the American base in Kandahar by Tuesday, Colonel Wilkerson said, but he could not say what would happen to them after that. Senior defense officials in Washington have said a new prison camp is being built at the naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to hold senior Al Qaeda and Taliban members. The Afghan authorities here contend that any delay in releasing or transferring prisoners from Shibarghan is the result of their efforts to accommodate American officials in their interrogations. Usman Khan, the intelligence chief in Shibarghan, said in an interview today that any decision on custody arrangements would wait until the United States had finished screening all prisoners and transferring those they wish to detain further. He said that would take a week more. ''First, we will remove all the foreign prisoners and Al Qaeda people, and then we will wait for orders on the rest,'' he said.

0~Countersuits Over North Carolina’s Bias Law~“They created state-sponsored discrimination against transgender individuals who simply seek to engage in the most private of functions in a place of safety and security,” she said at a news conference in Washington. “None of us can stand by when a state enters the business of legislating identity and insists that a person pretend to be something or someone that they are not.” Straying from her usual understated, lawyerly tone, Ms. Lynch, a North Carolina native, grew impassioned as she likened the fight to earlier battles over Jim Crow laws and laws against same-sex marriage. “This is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress,” she said. Addressing transgender people, she added: “We see you. We stand with you, and we will do everything we can to protect you going forward.” The Justice Department’s lawsuit, filed in a different federal court in the state, argued that North Carolina’s law, which prohibits people from using public restrooms that do not correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates, compels “public agencies to follow a facially discriminatory policy.” Even before the Justice Department challenged the law in court, the federal government had been examining how it could pressure North Carolina. Last month, federal agencies acknowledged that they were studying whether the law affected North Carolina’s eligibility for aid from Washington that helps pay for schools, highways and housing.
0~El hundimiento del Moskva es un desafío para Rusia~El silencio oficial en torno al destino de la tripulación del Moskva es parte de una campaña más amplia del Kremlin para ocultar las malas noticias sobre la guerra y controlar el relato que reciben los rusos sobre su avance. Muchos de los tripulantes desaparecidos eran reclutas. La leva ha sido un tema sensible en Rusia desde la guerra en Chechenia, cuando soldados jóvenes con poco entrenamiento fueron enviados a la batalla y murieron en grandes cantidades, lo que agrió el apoyo popular a la guerra. La causa del hundimiento está en disputa. Rusia asegura que un cargador de municiones explotó en un incendio y luego el barco dañado se hundió al ser remolcado en medio de un mar picado. Ucrania dijo que había atacado la embarcación con dos misiles Neptuno, una versión que funcionarios estadounidenses corroboraron. Cualquiera que sea el caso, la pérdida de uno de los mayores buques de guerra desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial ha sido una vergüenza para Rusia. Los medios independientes rusos, con sede fuera del país, han informado que alrededor de 40 hombres murieron y otros 100 resultaron heridos cuando el buque de guerra fue dañado y se hundió. Dichos informes citaban a un oficial no identificado y a la madre de un marino fallecido. Además, la esposa de un cadete naval mayor confirmó su muerte en Radio Libertad, una red radiodifusora gubernamental estadounidense basada fuera de Rusia.
0~5 People, Including 2 Deputies, Are Killed in North Carolina Standoff~Two sheriff’s deputies were among four people who were killed in a 13-hour standoff in Boone, N.C., that the authorities said started on Wednesday morning when they were called to the home of a man who had not shown up for work. Deputies from the Watauga County Sheriff’s Office arrived at a house at 9:44 a.m. on Wednesday after the homeowner’s employer called to report that the person had not come to work or answered telephone calls, the sheriff’s office said. When the deputies went inside, two of them were shot as they descended the basement steps, Sheriff Len Hagaman said. Sheriff Hagaman told reporters it was fair to say his deputies had been ambushed by the gunman, who was later identified by officials as Isaac Alton Barnes, 32. He is also suspected of killing his mother, Michelle Annette Ligon, 61, and his stepfather, George Wyatt Ligon, 58, before killing himself, according to a statement Thursday afternoon from the sheriff’s office.
0~New York Suburb Declares Measles Emergency, Barring Unvaccinated Children From Public~[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] An executive order pulled close to 6,000 unvaccinated children out of schools. Nearly 17,000 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (M.M.R.) vaccine were given in 26 weeks. There was a public health campaign in which community officials, doctors and rabbis testified to the importance of immunizations. None of those efforts stemmed the severe measles outbreak that has been plaguing Rockland County in New York since October. So on Tuesday, in an extraordinary step, the county executive, Ed Day, declared a state of emergency, effective at midnight, that would bar children and teenagers who are not vaccinated against measles from public places. Mr. Day said he believed Rockland County’s order was the first of its kind in the United States, and several public health experts said that they could not recall any action like it in recent years.
0~Trump, Having Denounced Amazon’s Shipping Deal, Orders Review of Postal Service~WASHINGTON — President Trump abruptly issued an executive order on Thursday demanding an evaluation of the Postal Service’s finances, asserting the power of his office weeks after accusing Amazon, the online retail giant, of not paying its fair share in postage. In the executive order, issued just before 9 p.m., Mr. Trump created a task force to examine the service’s “unsustainable financial path” and directed the new panel to “conduct a thorough evaluation of the operations and finances of the U.S.P.S.” The president does not mention Amazon in the order, but it is clear that he intends for the panel to substantiate his repeated claim that the financial arrangement between the Postal Service and Amazon, its biggest shipper of packages, is a money loser. In December, Mr. Trump railed against the service on Twitter for being “dumber and poorer” by losing billions of dollars and not “charging MUCH MORE” to Amazon and other shippers. His Twitter attacks date back as far as 2013, when he scoffed at the service for planning to eliminate Saturday mail delivery — “our poor, poor Country,” he wrote — and raising the cost of stamps.
0~Minimum Wage Provisions Fails to Advance~The Democrats voting against the proposal were Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, and Jon Tester of Montana. Senator Angus King, the independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, also voted no. The vote remained open for hours as Democrats struggled to reach an agreement on jobless aid. On Friday evening, lawmakers reached a compromise that would keep supplemental unemployment benefits at $300 per week through Sept. 6, an agreement that will allow the voting to continue. While Mr. Biden included the minimum wage increase in his stimulus proposal and the House passed it as part of its version of the package, a top Senate official, Elizabeth MacDonough, ruled that it could not be included in the bill under the strict rules governing the reconciliation process, which protects legislation from filibusters and allows it to pass with a simple majority. Democrats are using reconciliation to fast-track the bill through the Senate. Liberal lawmakers and activists argued that Democrats should overrule Ms. MacDonough’s guidance and push through the proposal anyway over Republican opposition. But the margin of defeat showed that they would not have had the votes to pass it unilaterally even if they had tried to do so. Instead, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the chairman of the Budget Committee, offered an amendment to add the provision during a marathon of rapid-fire proposals, known as a vote-a-rama, that began late Friday morning.
0~Video: What We Know About the Death of David McAtee~[gunshots] Police and National Guardsmen in Kentucky are under investigation after David McAtee, a restaurant owner in Louisville, was shot and killed during a heightened moment in the city, when people were protesting police violence. Crowd: “Breonna Taylor!” Kentucky’s governor released videos of the incident, and says police were responding to gunfire when McAtee was shot. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. The Times analyzed those videos, police scanner audio and a livestream filmed by a bystander. We synchronized the videos precisely by lining up key moments, allowing us to see — and most critically, hear — what happened from four different angles. We’ll see how the episode started, and how questionable policing tactics resulted in a fatal outcome. It’s just after midnight on Monday, June 1, when police and National Guardsmen arrive at a busy intersection in West Louisville. They’ve been sent to enforce a dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed by Louisville’s mayor. David McAtee, also known as Yaya, is in his barbecue stand, smoking food for customers. Across the street at Dino’s Food Mart, a local resident, Chris Smith, is livestreaming to Facebook as he hangs out with friends. “We out here. We out here.” His video will provide us with audio of critical moments. “Hold on.” “Police just came.” “Go. In the car and leave, just go.” “I‘m gone, soon as I get my keys.” As the area by Dino’s is cleared, a police officer and guardsman cross the street toward Yaya’s. One police officer readies a weapon as they approach the area. It appears to be a modified paintball gun which the Louisville police used to fire pepper balls, like you see in this footage from a previous incident. “… at us, like, directly at us.” While crossing the street, the officer aims it at the bystanders near Yaya’s, and fires a pepper ball into the curb. Immediately, diners to the front of Yaya’s hurry back along the alleyway, and take shelter inside the building through a side door. McAtee, who hasn’t seen what happened, approaches the doorway from inside. He appears to have a gun holstered on his right hip. McAtee and his niece stand by the door and peer outside. There appears to be no immediate threat to the officers at this moment, but one of them immediately fires at least two pepper balls at them. Let’s watch this back, side by side. McAtee and his niece are by the door. A police officer is aiming the pepper-ball gun at the door. As they peer out, one pepper ball pierces a soda bottle, which falls from the table. Another strikes the doorway, and just misses the head of McAtee’s niece. She ducks and falls back inside. In response, McAtee appears to fire his handgun out the side door. It’s unclear where he’s aiming. [gunshot] “Front door.” We’ll replay this moment from different camera angles to show what happens. The livestream from Dino’s picks up this gunshot. “Where you going? I saw you at the site.” [shouting] The police and guardsmen nearest the restaurant immediately retreat. The officer who fired pepper balls now draws a handgun. “Shots fired, shots fired.” Another officer radios into dispatch, and others take cover in the area. “Shots fired northwest side.” Eight seconds later, McAtee peers out again, and again raises his arm. [gunshots] The same police officer, two guardsmen and another officer fire 18 rounds at McAtee. He stumbles inside, drops a handgun and collapses to the ground. One bullet hit his chest. Louisville police guidelines say officers must avoid the use of force when trying to disperse nonviolent crowds. They must also ID themselves, issue a dispersal order and give people reasonable time to disperse. None of that appears to have happened here. A day after the shooting, the assistant police chief described how officers use pepper balls. “It is police policy when we use pepper-ball spray to actually shoot at the ground.” That also did not happen. Pepper balls were fired into the doorway where people were standing. Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear, said the investigation will continue, and urged the public to examine the video footage frame by frame. “And people can see with their own eyes, and make determinations with their own eyes.” “What do we want?” “Justice.” “When do we want it?” “Now.” “What do we want?” “Justice.” “When do we want it?” “Now.”
0~Merck’s Covid pill is cleared for high-risk adults.~The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday authorized a second antiviral pill for Covid but said it should not be a preferred treatment. The F.D.A. cleared the pill, developed by Merck and known as molnupiravir, for adults who are vulnerable to becoming severely ill from Covid and for whom alternative Covid treatment options authorized by the F.D.A. are “not accessible or clinically appropriate.” The F.D.A.’s decision reflects concerns that Merck’s pill is only modestly effective while also carrying the possible risk of causing reproductive harm. But in the coming weeks, it is expected to be more available in the United States than other treatment options. Older people and those who have conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease would be eligible to get a prescription for Merck’s pills if they get sick from the coronavirus and cannot get treatments such as Pfizer’s newly authorized pills or monoclonal antibody treatments. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people will be eligible.
0~The Tiny Swiss Company That Thinks It Can Help Stop Climate Change~Even the most enthusiastic believers in direct air capture stop short of describing it as a miracle technology. It’s more frequently described as an old idea — “scrubbers” that remove CO₂ have been used in submarines since at least the 1950s — that is being radically upgraded for a variety of new applications. It’s arguably the case, in fact, that when it comes to reducing our carbon emissions, direct air capture will be seen as an option that’s too expensive and too modest in impact. “The only way that direct air capture becomes meaningful is if we do all the other things we need to do promptly,” Hal Harvey, a California energy analyst who studies climate-friendly technologies and policies, told me recently. Harvey and others make the case that the biggest, fastest and cheapest gains in addressing atmospheric carbon will come from switching our power grid to renewable energy or low-carbon electricity; from transitioning to electric vehicles and imposing stricter mileage regulations on gas-powered cars and trucks; and from requiring more energy-efficient buildings and appliances. In short, the best way to start making progress toward a decarbonized world is not to rev up millions of air capture machines right now. It’s to stop putting CO₂ in the atmosphere in the first place. The future of carbon mitigation, however, is on a countdown timer, as atmospheric CO₂ concentrations have continued to rise. If the nations of the world were to continue on the current track, it would be impossible to meet the objectives of the 2016 Paris Agreement, which set a goal limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius or, ideally, 1.5 degrees. And it would usher in a world of misery and economic hardship. Already, temperatures in some regions have climbed more than 1 degree Celsius, as a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted last October. These temperature increases have led to an increase in droughts, heat waves, floods and biodiversity losses and make the chaos of 2 or 3 degrees’ additional warming seem inconceivable. A further problem is that maintaining today’s emissions path for too long runs the risk of doing irreparable damage to the earth’s ecosystems — causing harm that no amount of technological innovation can make right. “There is no reverse gear for natural systems,” Harvey says. “If they go, they go. If we defrost the tundra, it’s game over.” The same might be said for the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, or our coral reefs. Such resources have an asymmetry in their natural architectures: They can take thousands or millions of years to form, but could reach conditions of catastrophic decline in just a few decades. At the moment, global CO₂ emissions are about 37 billion metric tons per year, and we’re on track to raise temperatures by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. To have a shot at maintaining a climate suitable for humans, the world’s nations most likely have to reduce CO₂ emissions drastically from the current level — to perhaps 15 billion or 20 billion metric tons per year by 2030; then, through some kind of unprecedented political and industrial effort, we need to bring carbon emissions to zero by around 2050. In this context, Climeworks’s effort to collect 1,000 metric tons of CO₂ on a rooftop near Zurich might seem like bailing out the ocean one bucket at a time. Conceptually, however, it’s important. Last year’s I.P.C.C. report noted that it may be impossible to limit warming to 1.5 degrees by 2100 through only a rapid switch to clean energy, electric cars and the like. To preserve a livable environment we may also need to extract CO₂ from the atmosphere. As Wurzbacher put it, “if you take all these numbers from the I.P.C.C., you end up with something like eight to 10 billion tons — gigatons — of CO₂ that need to be removed from the air every year, if we are serious about 1.5 or 2 degrees.” There happens to be a name for things that can do this kind of extraction work: negative-emissions technologies, or NETs. Some NETs, like trees and plants, predate us and probably don’t deserve the label. Through photosynthesis, our forests take extraordinary amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and if we were to magnify efforts to reforest clear-cut areas — or plant new groves, a process known as afforestation — we could absorb billions more metric tons of carbon in future years. What’s more, we could grow crops specifically to absorb CO₂ and then burn them for power generation, with the intention of capturing the power-plant emissions and pumping them underground, a process known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. Other negative-emissions technologies include manipulating farmland soil or coastal wetlands so they will trap more atmospheric carbon and grinding up mineral formations so they will absorb CO₂ more readily, a process known as “enhanced weathering.” Negative emissions can be thought of as a form of time travel. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, human societies have produced an excess of CO₂, by taking carbon stores from deep inside the earth — in the form of coal, oil and gas — and from stores aboveground (mostly wood), then putting it into the atmosphere by burning it. It has become imperative to reverse the process — that is, take CO₂ out of the air and either restore it deep inside the earth or contain it within new surface ecosystems. This is certainly easier to prescribe than achieve. “All of negative emission is hard — even afforestation or reforestation,” Sally Benson, a professor of energy-resources engineering at Stanford, explains. “It’s not about saying, ‘I want to plant a tree.’ It’s about saying, ‘We want to plant a billion trees.’ ” Nevertheless, such practices offer a glimmer of hope for meeting future emissions targets. “We have to come to grips with the fact that we waited too long and that we took some options off the table,” Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton scientist who studies climate and policy, told me. As a result, NETs no longer seem to be just interesting ideas; they look like necessities. And as it happens, the Climeworks machines on the rooftop do the work each year of about 36,000 trees.
0~Justice Department Sues Barclays Over Mortgage-Backed Securities~LONDON — United States authorities have accused the British bank Barclays and two former executives of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Thursday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn after the two sides failed to reach a settlement despite months of talks. The department has also been in settlement talks with other large European lenders, including Credit Suisse, as the end of the Obama administration nears. Late Thursday, Deutsche Bank said that it had reached a tentative $7.2 billion deal with the Justice Department to resolve a federal investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage securities after months of negotiations. On Thursday, the Justice Department said Barclays’ actions in the packaging and sale of what are known as residential mortgage-backed securities in the years leading to the financial crisis injured tens of thousands of investors when the housing market collapsed. The lawsuit claims that Barclays — which has significant investment banking operations in New York — repeatedly misled investors about the quality of mortgages underlying 36 mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007. Those deals securitized more than $31 billion in subprime and other mortgage loans, according to the complaint. The Justice Department said they turned out to be “catastrophic failures.”
0~Prosecutors Open Arguments Against Defendant in First Jan. 6 Trial~“He planned to light the match that would start the fire,” Jeffrey S. Nestler, a federal prosecutor, said in an opening statement. “He wanted to stop Congress from doing its job.” As the trial unfolds over the next several days, the government intends to offer evidence that Mr. Reffitt, 41, had a standoff with the police outside the Capitol after traveling to Washington from his home in Wylie, Texas. Prosecutors say Mr. Reffitt came to Washington with a fellow member of the Texas Three Percenters, a loosely organized militia movement that takes its name from the supposed 3 percent of the U.S. colonial population that fought against the British. Mr. Nestler said that prosecutors would introduce messages that Mr. Reffitt had sent to other members of the group in advance of the attack, saying that “the fuel is set” and that he planned to “strike the match in DC on Jan. 6.” The Three Percenter who traveled with him to Washington, Rocky Hardy, is set to testify under an immunity deal with the government. Prosecutors also plan to elicit testimony from two of Mr. Reffitt’s children, Jackson and Peyton, who were teenagers at the time of the attack. The children plan to say their father threatened them after he returned to Texas in order to keep them from turning him in to the authorities. A large man with a barrel chest and a pigtail, Mr. Reffitt sat without showing much emotion as Mr. Nestler told the jury how he had led a large group of rioters up a staircase at the Capitol, just outside the Senate chamber, brushing off attempts by the police to stop him with pepper balls and heavier projectiles. Even after he was finally subdued with a canister of pepper spray, Mr. Reffitt urged the crowd around him to push on, Mr. Nestler said.
0~Letitia James Has Embraced Andrew Cuomo. Is It Worth It?~For Letitia James, politics has made quick and convenient bedfellows. After Eric T. Schneiderman suddenly resigned in May as New York’s attorney general, it soon became clear that Ms. James, the New York City public advocate, was the favored choice of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to succeed him. Within weeks, Mr. Cuomo endorsed Ms. James; the Democratic Party’s formal nomination quickly followed. The governor then held a fund-raiser for her with a minimum ticket price of $1,000. He invited her to appear with him at rallies for reproductive rights. And, in July, he brought Ms. James and several of his political allies on his fifth trip to Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria. As the other three Democratic candidates for attorney general have tried to distance themselves from Mr. Cuomo, Ms. James has fully embraced him. But at a time when prosecuting Wall Street, pursuing political corruption in Albany, and being willing to challenge President Trump and his administration are considered highly prized qualifications for the job, Ms. James’s strategy has been one of high rewards, but also some risk. “Perhaps no criterion is more important right now than the capacity of the next attorney general to be independent,” said the former attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, under whose tenure Ms. James ran the office’s Brooklyn operations. “The occupant of that office must have the wherewithal to pursue cases against the most powerful forces without regard to political consequences.”
0~U.S. announces sweeping restrictions on technological exports to Russia.~The Biden administration on Thursday announced a series of restrictions aimed at cutting off Russia’s access to foreign products like semiconductors, computers, lasers and telecommunications equipment in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The measures, which analysts called significant, will halt direct technological exports from the United States to Russia, in an effort to curtail Russian industries including defense, aerospace and shipping. They also go beyond previous sanctions issued by the U.S. government by placing new limitations on products that are manufactured outside the United States but use American equipment or technology. Under the new rules, high-tech goods that are made in foreign countries using American machinery, software or blueprints cannot be exported to Russia — restrictions that echo the kind of punitive curbs the United States imposed on the Chinese telecom firm Huawei in 2020. “This is going to impose severe cost on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time,” President Biden said on Thursday.
0~Paths Interlaced, Like Wisteria Vines~It’s artistic and fun, which would also be one way to describe Mr. Neidich, a video and performance artist who graduated in May from the Masters of Fine Arts program at the California Institute of the Arts. Friends describe him as an anomaly: a happy-go-lucky artist. “He’s always been open, outgoing, cheerful,” his mother said. “He wakes up in a good mood. He sometimes tries to act like he’s moody or difficult, but it’s just a sham.” His videos are often about mundane subjects like doing the laundry, but his approach is upbeat. “It’s about finding that special moment in the ordinary,” he said. “The bubbles when you do the dishes, the sound of scissors when you get your hair cut.” In January 2011, after living in Berlin for three years and working as an artist’s assistant, Mr. Neidich, now 29, stopped in Manhattan on his way to California for graduate school. He went to lots of parties, as always. “He has a million friends,” said Helen Brown, one of them. “He can talk to anyone. He can go super-intellectual and talk about art or talk about the dumbest stuff ever.” At one party, a small black-tie dinner on Jan. 31, he was seated next to Aliza Jennifer Zelin, a dark-haired beauty who also grew up in New York. They had many mutual friends, and their paths had often crossed, but never for long. She was working at Valentino, in the public relations department. Just as he is not a stereotypical artist, she is not a stereotypical fashionista. For one thing, she’s a bookworm. And although she loves haute couture and wickedly high heels, she’s also down to earth and hardy.
0~New York Philharmonic Cancels Season Because of Coronavirus~In canceling the season, which was to have run through the second week of June and included a European tour in the beginning of May, the Philharmonic said that its musicians’ health benefits would be maintained through the end of their current contract, in September. But pay will be reduced in stages. The musicians will earn their full salaries through March, then receive the orchestra’s base pay (roughly $3,000 per week) in April and 75 percent of that amount (about $2,200 per week) in May. They and the Philharmonic will meet as conditions progress to determine compensation for June and beyond. “We don’t know what this is going to look like,” said the trombonist Colin Williams, the chairman of the musicians’ negotiating committee. “Everything changes every 12 hours. So we’re going to have to get together and reassess.” “We’re all coming together in this unprecedented situation to make sure the institution is as insulated as possible,” he added. “But we’re very grateful for the leadership of Deborah Borda and the board that they’re trying to take care of the musicians.” Ms. Borda said that the relatively small size of the orchestra made it possible to maintain wages, even if reduced — compared with far larger organizations like the Metropolitan Opera, which will not compensate its unionized orchestra, chorus and stagehands after this month, beyond health benefits.
0~I.R.S. Says Funding Won’t Mean More Audits for Middle-Income Americans~WASHINGTON — Charles P. Rettig, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, told Congress on Thursday that the tax collection agency would not increase audits of households earning less than $400,000 if it was given the additional $80 billion that lawmakers were considering in a proposed climate and tax legislation package. Providing more funding for the I.R.S. has been a top priority of the Biden administration and has emerged as key way to finance some of the policies that Democrats are proposing without raising individual tax rates. The additional funding is expected to go toward hiring more enforcement agents to crack down on wealthy tax evaders and corporations and to modernize the agency’s antiquated technology. “These resources are absolutely not about increasing audit scrutiny on small businesses or middle-income Americans,” Mr. Retting wrote in a letter to lawmakers. “As we have been planning, our investment of these enforcement resources is designed around Treasury’s directive that audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for households making under $400,000.” That commitment is in keeping with President Biden’s promise not to raise taxes on middle-income Americans.
0~A thrilling tennis match won fans an exception to France’s curfew.~French officials delivered one of the great moments of sports in the pandemic on Friday night, as the clock crept toward an 11 p.m. curfew in Paris that seemed destined to clear the stands during an epic French Open men’s tennis semifinal between Rafael Nadal of Spain and Novak Djokovic of Serbia. An earlier men’s semifinal on Court Philippe-Chatrier lasted more than three-and-a-half hours, meaning that Djokovic and Nadal did not take the court until after 7 p.m. Then the two longtime rivals started a stunning display of tennis, a roller-coaster duel in which Nadal, the 13-time French champion, grabbed the first set, and Djokovic, the world’s top-ranked men’s player, battled to win the next two. The first three sets in the best-of-five match lasted three-and-a-half hours. As the third set ended, the celebration turned to howls and catcalls as a stadium announcer began to make a statement that the crowd of 5,000 expected to be a warning that they needed to soon head for the exits. Fans chanted, “We’re not moving,” and called for the resignation of the tournament director, Guy Forget.
0~U.K. Coronavirus Vaccine Campaign Begins~LONDON — In March, the emergency room doctor was bedridden with the first case of the coronavirus among his colleagues at a hospital in Wales. Within weeks, he was back in scrubs, tending to a crush of ill, breathless patients. On Tuesday, after having weathered each turn in Britain’s ravaging bout with the coronavirus, the doctor, Farbod Babolhavaeji, was given one of the world’s first shots of a clinically authorized, fully tested vaccine — a step in the long, painstaking campaign to knock back a disease that has killed more than 1.5 million people worldwide. Images of the first people to be vaccinated were broadcast around the country, led by Margaret Keenan, 90, a former jewelry shop assistant in a “Merry Christmas” T-shirt, and an 81-year-old man with the improbable name of William Shakespeare. They quickly became emblems of the remarkable race to make a vaccine, and the world’s agonizing wait for relief from deaths now numbering 11,000 a day. Never before has Britain undertaken such a fiendishly difficult mass vaccination program. Given pizza boxlike trays of 975 doses each, hospitals stored them in deep freezers, defrosted them and, on Tuesday, drew them up into individual syringes and jabbed them into the upper arms of variously jubilant and needle-shy Britons. Every minute mattered: Defrosted doses that were not given by Friday would be wasted.
0~In the U.K., Migrants From Hong Kong Build a New Life~Britain has called the program a humanitarian, post-colonial responsibility after a crackdown in Hong Kong by the Chinese government, saying that Beijing is violating the terms of a handover agreement in 1997 that would leave the former British colony untouched politically. From bustling cities like Birmingham in the Midlands to vibrant towns like Kingston, south of London, tens of thousands of people from Hong Kong have spent the past year searching for jobs and new homes. They have settled into fast-growing communities of other people from Hong Kong, a comfort for many, but at the cost of leaving behind a city where they had once hoped to grow old with their children, often having to say painful farewells to loved ones. “You grow up in a place, and you don’t recognize it. It becomes a stranger,” Mr. Wong said on a recent afternoon, reflecting on the changes in Hong Kong as he mixed evaporated milk into a kettle of steaming tea. “When we think of it, we just want to cry.” He said that he had been forced to leave his ailing father behind in Hong Kong, but that concern for the future of his 4-year-old daughter, after whom he has named his new business in England, had trumped other concerns. “People say I brought Trini to England,” he said, “but I think of it as the opposite: Trini brought me here.”
0~White House Declares War on Impeachment Inquiry, Claiming Effort to Undo Trump’s Election~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, the White House response to the impeachment inquiry has been to dismiss the allegations, deflect the facts and discredit the Democrats. It’s the same approach used by Republicans in 2018 to push through the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. My colleagues Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, the authors of “The Education of Brett Kavanaugh” talk to the Republican strategist who wrote the political playbook used then and now. It’s Thursday, October 10th. Robin, Kate, how did you first come to hear the name Mike Davis? kate kelly So we were looking back on the events of 2018 that were just so seismic for the country and trying to really slow down time and figure out very much from a 360-degree perspective who were the key players in that drama? Obviously, you had then-judge Kavanaugh. You had the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct and lawyers on both sides. But the political machinery — who were the important members of the Senate Judiciary Committee? And everyone said we should talk to this one operative — that he was at the center of everything. And that operative’s name was Mike Davis. mike davis Hey, is that Robin? Or is that Kate? kate kelly That was Kate just now, but Robin’s right here. mike davis Hello. kate kelly And everybody told us that he was sort of an unabashed advocate for Judge Kavanaugh and really sort of the torch-carrier politically through this process. And what he did in terms of not just managing the technicalities of the Senate investigation and the Senate process, but also waging this sort of cultural war for conservatives that was crystallized during the Kavanaugh confirmation process and is now being deployed as a defense against impeachment. michael barbaro So you knew that you wanted to talk to him. kate kelly Yes. robin pogrebin And so in talking to him, you know, he actually turns out to be somewhat of an unlikely character. kate kelly And would like to start by just asking you — tell us about your career background. How did you decide to become a lawyer? mike davis Ever since I was a little kid, I think my teachers, the priests, the nuns at my Catholic school knew that I was going to be a lawyer just because I was so mouthy as a kid. robin pogrebin He’s kind of a spark plug of a guy. He’s sort of built compactly. He’s very much of a kind of a tough talker. He takes no prisoners. But he was born and raised in Iowa. mike davis So I was raised by two very liberal Democrats who worked in public schools. And so I was raised very working class. I was raised Catholic. So I had the bleeding heart Catholic stuff from my mom. robin pogrebin And he had his own kind of awakening in terms of conservative issues. mike davis You know, I’ve always been kind of a right wing lunatic, even from a young age. robin pogrebin And even in sixth grade, he won the Alex P. Keaton award. kate kelly Alex P. Keaton, of course, being a reference to the beloved 1980s sitcom “Family Ties” where you have two bleeding heart liberal parents in Ohio with a large family, and they have this super conservative son, Alex P. Keaton, who, like, loves Reaganomics and is, like, a total black sheep within that context. michael barbaro Right — bounds into the kitchen every morning in his tie and his jacket. robin pogrebin Suspenders. michael barbaro Like raving about Reagan. kate kelly Right. Right. mike davis I saw the effects of these policies that liberals — that Democrats thought were helping people who needed help and they actually trap people in inter-generational poverty. So for me, that was the reason I became Republican is I saw — robin pogrebin And so then by college, he is working as an intern for Newt Gingrich, who kind of defined the outer edges of Republican philosophy at the time with the Contract for America. michael barbaro Which is a very much less government is better approach. robin pogrebin Right. Hands off. And he kind of becomes really sort of evangelized in a way. And he wants to be a soldier. mike davis My first job in Washington D.C. was back in 1998 as an undergraduate intern working in the office of House Speaker Newt Gingrich. robin pogrebin And while he works for Newt Gingrich, the Clinton impeachment is going on. So Mike Davis has a front row seat on that strategy. And it makes a strong impression on him. mike davis I remember watching this up close and personally. The last day of my internship was the same day that the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Clinton. kate kelly And he’s watching all of this going on — he’s very intrigued by it. And he’s taking notes as to how these processes are unfolding and how the parties are reshaping themselves in the early to mid-90s. michael barbaro So the impeachment of Bill Clinton would have been Mike Davis’ first culture war, so to speak. And it sounds like he was very closely paying attention to it. kate kelly Absolutely. He’s becoming a keen observer of politics. He has worked a stint for Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley opening mail. mike davis That was in May of 2000. I was 22 years old right out of school. kate kelly He works in the Justice Department for a spell. He goes to law school, becomes a lawyer. And he decides he wants to engage with all of these issues. And he’s going to do it from various angles. And at some point, he meets Neil Gorsuch. mike davis He was in private practice, and I helped him find his way into the Justice Department and then his way onto the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado. kate kelly Gorsuch is named to the Tenth Circuit court in Colorado. mike davis Then when Neil Gorsuch got confirmed as Judge Gorsuch, he asked me to go out to Colorado to clerk for him. So I went out to Colorado for a year. kate kelly Davis clerks for him. mike davis And I liked it so much that I stayed out there. I was in the private practice of law for 10 years. kate kelly Davis very early on sees a lot of potential in Gorsuch — sees him as someone, you know, he would like to align himself with and maybe help promote from behind the scenes. And he remains close to Judge Gorsuch for a long period of time. michael barbaro And what do you think that Davis sees in Gorsuch? Why is he latching on to him? robin pogrebin So what Mike Davis sees in Neil Gorsuch is kind of the embodiment of these values that Mike Davis has come to care about and be committed to. And Neil Gorsuch is kind of the perfect candidate right out of central casting. He not only has hard and strong conservative values, but he’s unapologetic about them in a way that Mike Davis feels enables him to go the distance. And Mike Davis realizes that changing the judiciary is the strongest avenue towards making lasting change in this country. michael barbaro How so? robin pogrebin Because those are judges who are — many of these appointments are for life. And this is the time when you’re making laws that are very difficult to change once you’ve made them as opposed to political administrations that can come and go. So this strategy, which is to confirm as many judges as possible as quickly as you can within kind of an ideological framework that fits with his values. michael barbaro So it’s kind of Alex P. Keaton woven into the law through judges like Neil Gorsuch. robin pogrebin Exactly. kate kelly So when the Trump administration begins, there’s this historic opportunity to fill the seat vacated by the conservative Justice Scalia who has died the year prior and whose seat has not been filled. Gorsuch is someone that Davis regards as an ideal choice to add to the court. So Davis is instrumental in helping Gorsuch sort of get on the map in terms of a potential nominee. Gorsuch is nominated. Davis then takes on the role of assisting Gorsuch from the outside through the nomination process — as a former clerk, a friend, a sort of colleague in legal circles for a number of years with shared government experience. Gorsuch is confirmed. And in fact, Davis is asked at age 39 to clerk for Gorsuch on the Supreme Court for the sort of stub-term that Gorsuch enters into. mike davis I was a pretty old law clerk — 39 years old walking around with my walker around the Supreme Court. kate kelly So he has that experience and then there’s this opening to be the chief nominations council working for Grassley on the Senate Judiciary Committee. And Davis’ reputation by now is cemented as sort of a dogged advocate and a skilled political operator. And now, he’s poised to work on potential Supreme Court nominations that will aid the conservative majority from the inside. robin pogrebin So take us back, Mike, to June 2018 — Justice Kennedy surprisingly announces his resignation. What is your reaction at the time? And then what is your next move? mike davis I was very excited. I thought it was a historic opportunity to solidify a conservative majority on the court. I was thinking that day, this is the reason that Republicans, that independents, even some right-thinking Democrats voted for President Trump, because of how important this vacancy would be. robin pogrebin And it’s the ultimate victory, because once you have a 5-4 majority on the court and you’re replacing Anthony Kennedy who was a swing vote, you will now have cemented this conservative shift, which is the ultimate goal for the Republicans. mike davis Justice Kavanaugh — then-Judge Kavanaugh was on that list. robin pogrebin So when Brett Kavanaugh is nominated, Chuck Grassley enlists Mike Davis as his kind of brass knuckles to make sure to close this deal, bring this guy over the finish line, and cement the conservative majority on the high court. mike davis There was no way I was going to let this good man, Justice Kavanaugh, get smeared with these bogus allegations and lies, because some people are fearful that he’s going to rule a certain way on Roe vs. Wade. michael barbaro Right, because Mike Davis saw this as an extension of the cultural wars that he’s been fighting for years. robin pogrebin Exactly. mike davis The Democrats brought the perfect storm here. It was the #MeToo cultural clash with a judicial fight. And it was just a fight that I was not going to back down from. kate kelly So for Davis, this is a historic moment. And he’s ready to pull out all the stops. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. [music playing] michael barbaro So Robin, Kate, what does the Mike Davis playbook look like when he actually tries to protect Brett Kavanaugh? kate kelly So there are sort of four key tenants to it. The first one is after a quick assessment of the facts and a feeling of confidence that the issue can be overcome, that’s when you message to your entire support network that you are going to stay the course. mike davis On September 20th, Kavanaugh was on life support. And Republicans were running for the hills. And what I wanted to do was send out a message that there was someone inside that Senate Judiciary Committee fighting. It was a bat signal. kate kelly So that’s where you see something like a September 20th tweet from Mike Davis saying, unfazed and determined. We will confirm Judge Kavanaugh. That’s days after Christine Blasey Ford has come public and Kavanaugh is very much in doubt in terms of whether his candidacy can move forward. So almost immediately, Davis is rushing to his rhetorical defense. mike davis It was to say that these allegations are not adding up. The lawyers are playing games. And we do not have a presumption of guilt in this country. robin pogrebin Number two is to turn the accused into the victim. In the case of Kavanaugh, that was to make the argument that Kavanaugh has already been evaluated by the F.B.I. mike davis He was a judge on the D.C. circuit for 12 years — the second-highest court in the land. He had six, now seven, F.B.I. full-field, single-scope background investigations. They talked to 160 people who knew him best. robin pogrebin This guy has already passed the test. Look what you’re putting him through again. You’re potentially ruining his family and his career. mike davis There was not a whiff of impropriety related to alcoholism or sexual abuse. robin pogrebin You’re dragging his name through the mud. You haven’t given this guy a fair trial and you’re already convicting him. mike davis In the #MeToo era, we’re just supposed to say, you know what? Let’s just throw due process out the door. Let’s just throw the presumption of innocence out the door. Let’s do this un-American presumption of guilt, because we’re in the #MeToo era. That is garbage. And we were not going to let that happen to a good man like Justice Kavanaugh. robin pogrebin Rather than trying to flesh out and understand better the accusations themselves. kate kelly The third tenet deals with casting doubt upon the facts and also tarnishing or perhaps politicizing the accuser. mike davis Listen, I don’t believe Dr. Ford’s allegations. I don’t think she’s telling the truth. But — robin pogrebin Tell us why. mike davis There’s just so many holes in her story and little fibs here and there. And when people make little fibs on things that are smaller, will they also fib about bigger things? I just don’t — robin pogrebin You saw that with Dr. Ford with some of the issues about fear of flying. mike davis She said that she had a Kavanaugh-induced fear of flying so she couldn’t come out to the hearing on a certain date. Her C.V. that she submitted to the committee shows as one of her interests international surf travel to places like Hawaii and Australia and all over the world. And I’m thinking, hm if she has this Kavanaugh-induced fear of flying, how did she get to Australia? Did she surf there? kate kelly Raising doubts about all those sorts of things as well as pointing to a lack of evidence or evidence that might suggest that the story is inaccurate. michael barbaro Even if the issue that’s being disputed is way off to the side. kate kelly Right. mike davis She has no memory of key details of the night in question. She doesn’t remember who invited her to the party or how she heard about it. She doesn’t remember how she got to the party. She doesn’t remember what — kate kelly And that is simply a way to put a seed of doubt in an already skeptical person’s mind about this account. robin pogrebin And number four is to frame this all in the context of a partisan battle. mike davis It’s the whole way this process was handled. It was the gamesmanship. It was Dianne Feinstein sitting on this letter for six weeks. It was this partisan hack lawyer who is representing Christine Blasey Ford, using her — robin pogrebin That this is a conspiracy, that it’s a witch hunt, and some of the language around this speaks to that — this real hyperbolic, huge, sweeping statements like a “calculated, orchestrated political hit,” which were the words of Brett Kavanaugh. mike davis I think this whole process was disgusting. And it was transparently political to me. robin pogrebin What that does is it removes us from the facts on the ground in terms of whether these allegations have any legitimacy and should be explored in any real way. And it takes it to the level of this is all just politics. kate kelly And Mike Davis has an analogy for what they’re doing here. mike davis What I did with Kavanaugh’s confirmation, I called it the “dead chicken strategy.” michael barbaro What on earth does that mean? What is the dead chicken strategy? kate kelly So remember that Davis for a brief period was a clerk for the newly installed Justice Gorsuch. And during that clerkship, the clerks would get together for lunch with individual justices. Davis had a lunch with Justice Clarence Thomas. And during that lunch, Thomas told this story about growing up on a farm in Georgia. mike davis Really resonated. He said when dogs killed chickens, they would take those chickens and wrap it around those dogs’ necks. And as those chickens rotted around those dogs’ necks, those dogs lost the taste for chicken. And I think that’s what Republicans need to start doing with the left. kate kelly Davis sees this as an analogy to what needs to be done to the liberals to punish them for their tactics. michael barbaro So who exactly are the characters in this colorful metaphor? kate kelly So in this case, the chicken is essentially the smears and lies that Davis believes that liberals have told about their political opponents — whether it was Judge Kavanaugh, whether it is President Trump, or any others who are part of the conservative objectives that Davis espouses. And they need to be punished and given a taste of their own medicine and have those smears pushed back in their face in order for them to lose the taste for that kind of political war-making. michael barbaro Hmm. kate kelly So because the Kavanaugh strategy worked so effectively, we wanted to ask Mike Davis the question — how is that playbook working for the Trump administration now as the conservatives are facing a very real threat to President Trump in the form of impeachment? michael barbaro And what does he say? kate kelly He says we’re seeing it unfold before our very eyes as it comes to handling the impeachment inquiry and defending an embattled President Trump. So you start with forceful denials and assertions that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the president. mike davis Impeachment should be a last resort. It is for high crimes and misdemeanors. And nothing that has been alleged against President Trump even comes close to those. Even if these allegations are true, which they’re not, it doesn’t even come close. kate kelly You then go to a discrediting of political opponents, of whistleblowers, or even the people that leaked to the original whistleblower. Were they politically motivated? Did they do the right thing? Then there’s an attack on the facts and whether or not they’re legitimate. mike davis With their outrageous lies and smears and impeachment mobs and #MeToo mobs. We need to fight back as conservatives, as Republicans. Because the left has a glass jaw, and if you fight back, it will break their glass jaw. kate kelly And then finally, there’s an invocation of this sort of the witch hunt — the persecution of the president, how un-American this is, and how inherently and disgustingly political it has become. mike davis This is a President of the United States. He was elected by the American people, whether the left likes it or not. robin pogrebin And just to stay with your chicken metaphor and clarify it, what’s the dead chicken and around whose neck in this case? mike davis Well, I mean, I think right now you’re looking at Joe Biden. The Democrats are going to hurt the one Democrat who has a shot at beating Trump by bringing in this whole Ukraine corruption mess. Because Joe Biden has his own problems with this Ukraine corruption mess. So be careful, Democrats, what you — this impeachment can of worms. michael barbaro So if the dead chicken strategy succeeds in the case of impeachment the way it sounds like he thinks it succeeded in the case of Kavanaugh, then Democrats will stop pursuing impeachment, because they will see the flaws in their arguments about why he should be impeached? kate kelly I think it’s even deeper than that. I think it’s that, but it’s also, perhaps, his belief that Democrats need to check their own motives and realize that this person has been elected and he’s here at least until 2021. And that they need to just be governed by this president and focus on legislation and other issues but drop the political animus and the tools he believes they are using to achieve political ends, which in his mind are smears and lies, among other things. michael barbaro I wonder, though, if Mike Davis is right that the same strategy that Republicans used successfully to confirm Brett Kavanaugh can work to fend off impeachment for President Trump, because the situations are quite different. One was a debate over what happened decades ago when people were in high school and memories were hazier and witnesses not available to corroborate something. Here, in the case of the Ukraine phone call, there is a transcript. There are people who listen in on the call. And there are whistleblowers to something that happened just about a month ago. So are these fundamentally different? robin pogrebin I think actually the template can still be applied to a very different set of circumstances, because the ultimate goal is to win. And so what you do is you remove this from the facts and you take it out of the substance. And it’s all about this sweeping general statement that this is a political hit job and that’s all you need to know. And keep focused on the fact that we have to defend this guy against a broad-based effort to take him down. kate kelly And don’t lose sight of the thing that undergirds this whole effort, which is the conservative culture war. Mike Davis, President Trump, and others have a vision for how the courts should look, how the country should look, and they are trying their level best to get to that through whatever means necessary. michael barbaro Right. And so efforts to stop it may take many forms, but they are, in this telling and through this playbook, all a part of the same effort to just stymie this. robin pogrebin Exactly. The interesting hitch in this kind of well-developed strategy is that if the person in question looks to be on the ropes, if it looks as if this battle is not going to be won, there is a kind of an exit strategy — an escape hatch, if you will. And in the case of President Trump, that might mean that if it feels as if there is not enough political will to survive this battle, there is a scenario in which you could imagine a guy like Mike Davis walking away. michael barbaro Really? Why? robin pogrebin Because ultimately, the most important thing is this larger culture war, not the individuals you’re fighting for. michael barbaro So if it looks like the country does support not just impeachment but removing the president from office — or not reelecting him — you could foresee a day where the great warriors in this battle — the Mike Davis’ — might just washed their hands of it. robin pogrebin That’s right, because the important thing is to have the big picture in mind. And the big picture is they want to transform this country. And they’re going to do whatever it takes to do that. And if there are casualties along the way, including the president, so be it. michael barbaro Thank you both very much. robin pogrebin Thank you. kate kelly Thank you. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. archived recording We witnessed the beginning of this defensive at around about 4 o’clock local time this afternoon — a series of loud explosions. You can probably hear more of them now. And it’s been pretty constant. michael barbaro On Wednesday, Turkey began a military assault on northeast Syria, launching airstrikes and firing artillery against American-backed Kurdish forces there. archived recording Volleys of artillery from our location in southern Turkey are being fired across the border onto Kurdish positions in northern Syria. michael barbaro The attack only began after President Trump approved it during a telephone call over the weekend with Turkey’s president. But on Wednesday, Trump seemed to regret that decision, saying in a statement that the US quote, “does not endorse this attack” and thinks it’s a bad idea. And — archived recording Batteries, extra lighting, flashlights — I have extra flashlights at home. I bought some ceiling lights. And then I’m going to try to serve as much of my food as I can with the ice. michael barbaro In an unusual move, the largest utility in California is deliberately cutting off power to at least two million residents to avoid the possibility of wildfires over the next few days. Forecasts for hot, dry air and winds of up to 70 miles per hour have created a high risk of fires started by downed power lines — the cause of several previous wildfires across California. archived recording We very much understand the inconvenience and difficulties such a power outage would cause. And we do not take or make this decision lightly. michael barbaro The power outages have disrupted life across the state, with schools canceling classes, stores closing their doors, and drivers navigating streets without working traffic lights, angering residents and prompting the utility, PG&E, to defend its decision. archived recording We implement public safety power shut off as a last resort. michael barbaro
0~Carl Heastie: The Man Who Would Oversee Cuomo’s Impeachment~Mr. Heastie assumed his new, more forceful posture against Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday only after an emergency virtual meeting of the Assembly Democrats he leads. No one, according to legislators on the afternoon call, spoke up in support of Mr. Cuomo after the report from Attorney General Letitia James substantiated allegations from multiple women who had accused Mr. Cuomo of inappropriate behavior. That the governor’s list of accusers had grown to include a state trooper — one who said Mr. Cuomo had left her feeling “completely violated” — made it far more difficult for anyone to defend him, lawmakers said. Mr. Heastie, an assemblyman since 2000, has witnessed the downfall of a long list of Albany politicians. A former Bronx County Democratic Party chairman, he became the first Black Assembly speaker only after Sheldon Silver, his predecessor, was arrested and charged with taking millions in payoffs. Mr. Heastie, like so many others who have circled through the capital, promised to change its culture of corruption. “We do not own this house,” Mr. Heastie said in his first Capitol speech as speaker. “We are simply tenants here.” He must now navigate the complex process of evicting the building’s most powerful occupant. Mr. Heastie’s caucus includes women — and some men — who have been clamoring for Mr. Cuomo’s ouster for months, as well as a bloc of mostly Black legislators who have urged more caution and stood alongside Mr. Cuomo as the investigation unfolded. Republicans almost universally want Mr. Cuomo to go, but Mr. Heastie has signaled he would wait until Democrats alone could muster the votes to impeach. John DeSio, a Democratic strategist who has worked in Bronx politics, said Mr. Heastie’s decision to stay mostly on the sidelines during the investigation had allowed him to better balance those competing legislative interests. “Carl has a reputation for holding things close, and, in this case, it has served him well,” he said. While that was a source of frustration to those who wanted to ratchet up pressure on Mr. Cuomo this spring — especially after the Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, called for Mr. Cuomo to step down — it appears to have bolstered Mr. Heastie’s standing with fellow Assembly members.
0~It’s Hollywood Barbie’s Moment (and She’s Bringing Her Friends)~For 62 years, Barbie has been the hardest-working woman in the toy aisle, using a dizzying array of outfits and accessories — and, lately, changing body shapes and skin tones — while gliding from one career to the next. Astrophysicist Barbie. Ballerina Barbie. Chicken Farmer Barbie. Firefighter Barbie. But she has never pulled off the ultimate transformation: Barbie, live-action movie star. Time and again, her corporate overlords at Mattel have teamed with Hollywood studios to make a big-budget film in hopes of forging a new revenue stream while giving Barbie new relevance. Time and again, nothing has emerged, in part because Mattel has tried to micromanage the creative process, alienating filmmakers. (You want Barbie to do what?) Financial turbulence and executive turnover at Mattel haven’t helped. A similar situation has played out with other Mattel brands, including Hot Wheels, American Girl and Masters of the Universe — a humiliation given the success that other toy companies have had in Hollywood, which loves nothing more than a movie concept with a built-in fan base. The inventive “Lego Movie” took in nearly $500 million at the global box office in 2014 for Warner Bros. and the Lego Group, resulting in a sequel and two spinoffs. Paramount Pictures and Hasbro have turned the Transformers action-figure line into a $5 billion big-screen franchise over the last 14 years; a seventh installment is on the way and will undoubtedly deliver the same halo for Hasbro as the previous films, driving up the company’s stock price and turbocharging demand for Transformers toys.
0~SoftBank Invests $3 Billion More in WeWork~WeWork, the co-working office company, has expanded rapidly over its eight-year life span, thanks in part to huge investments from SoftBank of Japan. On Tuesday, it secured another big cash infusion from its largest investor. WeWork announced that SoftBank had committed an additional $3 billion at a valuation of at least $42 billion. That is more than double the $20 billion level that WeWork attained in its last fund-raising round over a year ago and makes WeWork one of the most valuable privately held venture-backed companies in America. SoftBank is injecting the new cash in exchange for a warrant to buy additional shares in WeWork. The deal highlights the costs of WeWork’s ambitious empire-building. The company is not only expanding rapidly around the world, it is also moving beyond its primary business of leasing and reselling office space into education, apartments and more. The company said Tuesday that it had 297,000 available desks in 24 countries and planned to open more than 100,000 new office desks for rent this quarter, the same amount it opened all of last year. WeWork said it generated $1.25 billion in revenue for the first nine months of 2018 and was on a pace to exceed $2 billion in sales by year-end.
0~Architects of Bernie Sanders’s 2016 Race Part Ways With 2020 Campaign~WASHINGTON — The architects of the 2016 insurgent campaign for Senator Bernie Sanders abruptly parted ways with his 2020 campaign on Tuesday, dealing him a surprise blow one week after he entered the presidential race with an emphatic show of fund-raising strength. The consultants, Tad Devine, Julian Mulvey and Mark Longabaugh, said in a statement that they were “leaving because we believe that Senator Sanders deserves to have media consultants who share his creative vision for the campaign.” Their decision was unexpected: The three produced the announcement video that Mr. Sanders released last week, which has helped him raise $10 million, and they had been intimately involved in the planning of a second White House bid for the Vermont senator. The rupture infuriated some of Mr. Sanders’s supporters, who feared it would detract from a stunning financial haul that they had hoped would quiet the doubters about a second Sanders candidacy. The shake-up was also the latest indication that Mr. Sanders is going to run a different kind of race this time around — or at least, that his advisers want him to do so.
0~U.S. Music Sales Drop 5%, as Habits Shift Online~As the music industry evolves, there has been no doubt that online streaming services like Spotify, Pandora and YouTube are growing fast, and generating more revenue for artists and record companies. The question is whether that growth is enough to offset dropping sales of CDs and downloads. The latest report on music sales indicates that, at least so far, it is not. According the Recording Industry Association of America, which collects sales numbers from the major record companies, just under $3.2 billion in music sales was recorded in the first half of 2014. That is down 4.9 percent from the same period in 2013, the association reported on Thursday. But a closer look at the numbers shows how much music consumption patterns are changing. In the first six months of 2014, downloads and streaming together amounted to $2.2 billion — virtually unchanged from the same period last year. But within that total, the proportions changed. Last year, downloads were about 69 percent of this category, by revenue, with the rest made up by streaming; this year, downloads were only 60 percent.
0~Texas House Passes Voting Bill as G.O.P. Nears a Hard-Fought Victory~Previous iterations of the bill had been stymied by House Democrats’ decisions to break quorum in two consecutive sessions, denying Republicans the necessary minimum of lawmakers to conduct business. During legislative debate on Thursday and Friday, Democrats denounced the proposed new voting restrictions as disproportionately harmful to Black and Latino Texans. Their amendments, aimed at weakening the legislation, mostly failed. “If you think that you’re winning today,” State Representative Senfronia Thompson, a long-serving Democrat from Houston, told her Republican colleagues on Friday, “you will reap what you sow.” Republicans’ response was, in essence, that it was not their job to entice more people to vote. During debate on Thursday, State Representative Andrew Murr, a Republican from rural Kerrville, applied Texas Republicans’ mantra of personal responsibility to voting. “I’m not sure the goal of the state is to actively seek out voters,” he said. “The state is not so proactive that it tries to grab all the voters.” How Times reporters cover politics.

Several late amendments to the bill addressed the integrity of voting and ballot counting systems, an outgrowth of former President Donald J. Trump’s false claims of widespread fraud in last year’s election. Some passed, like a requirement that large Texas counties provide livestreaming video of ballot-counting areas. Others did not, such as a Republican amendment to conduct a “forensic audit” of the 2020 election in Texas. One of the last amendments on Thursday was aimed at avoiding criminal prosecutions of formerly incarcerated people for voting — people like Crystal Mason and Hervis Rogers — by instructing judges to tell those convicted of felonies that they are ineligible to vote. In addition to voting on the elections bill on Friday, the House is also considering a number of Republican priorities that have made 2021 among the most conservative legislative sessions in the history of Texas, including increasing funding for building a border wall and a bill on “censorship” by social media platforms.
0~Biden’s Win Means a Demotion for Netanyahu and Less Focus on Israel~Most immediately, analysts and officials said, Israel will feel the transition to a Biden administration as a shift of focus away from the conflict with the Palestinians. With a pandemic, a battered economy and deep societal fissures demanding his attention, Mr. Biden, to the extent he looks abroad, is expected to place greater emphasis on tensions with China and Russia, climate change and repairing the frayed trans-Atlantic alliance. Looming large, however, are questions about Iran. Mr. Biden has spoken of showing Tehran a “path back to diplomacy,” offering to re-enter the Obama administration’s nuclear deal if Iran returns to strict compliance. Mr. Netanyahu crusaded against the agreement and cheered Mr. Trump’s withdrawal from it. In contrast to Mr. Trump’s favoritism toward Israel, Mr. Biden has promised a return to a more balanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That could mean, analysts and former officials suggested, that if Arab states like Morocco, Oman or Saudi Arabia express willingness to normalize ties with Israel, a Biden administration might encourage them to insist on Israeli concessions to the Palestinians in return. Still, Mr. Biden is under few illusions, his advisers say, that a settlement is achievable with Mr. Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas, the longtime Palestinian president, still in their jobs. Instead, the new administration is expected to exert a calming influence. That could mean reopening the American consulate in Jerusalem, which Mr. Trump disbanded, as a quasi-embassy to the Palestinians; reopening a Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington, and restoring U.S. funding for East Jerusalem hospitals, aid projects on the West Bank and Palestinian refugees.
0~Mylan Invests in EpiPen as Child Allergies Increase~“I think this goes to the heart of being able to do good and do well,” she said. Although no one knows exactly why, the rate of food allergies among children appears to be on the rise. One survey found that in 2008, one in 70 children was allergic to peanuts, compared with one in 250 in 1997. “I don’t think it’s overdiagnosis,” said Dr. Scott H. Sicherer, the author of the report and a researcher at the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. “There really seems to be a difference.” A study last year in the journal Pediatrics found that about one in 13 children had a food allergy, and nearly 40 percent of those with allergies had severe reactions. A recent survey in Massachusetts, where schools are permitted to administer epinephrine to any student, found that one-quarter of students who had to be given the drug for a reaction did not know they had an allergy. But in many schools, employees are not allowed to use epinephrine injectors on children who do not have a prescription. That’s what happened in January when Amarria Johnson, a first grader from Chesterfield, Va., developed a severe allergic reaction. Her mother, Laura Pendleton, said Amarria’s allergy to peanuts was known, but the school did not have an EpiPen that was prescribed to her. At the time, school employees were not allowed to use injectors that were prescribed to other children. Another student gave Amarria a peanut during recess, and by the time paramedics arrived, Amarria had stopped breathing and could not be resuscitated, according to the Chesterfield County police. In April, Virginia’s governor signed a law that lifted those restrictions and required all schools to carry injectors for emergency use. Ms. Pendleton said parents could not police everything their child ate. “You need to have the EpiPens there just in case,” she said.
0~‘Potentially Dangerous Situation’ on Tappan Zee Delays Opening of New Cuomo Bridge Span~On Saturday, the Coast Guard reopened the western part of the river to vessels that checked with the patrol commander enforcing the safety zone, but it said the eastern half remained closed because of the destabilized bridge. Coast Guard officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The problem came a day after Mr. Cuomo and other dignitaries gathered at the new bridge to celebrate the planned opening of the second span. Mr. Cuomo lauded the new bridge as a testament to “New York’s greatness” that “shows the world that we’re capable of dreaming big and delivering results for the people of this state.” The first span of the new bridge, a $4 billion project, opened last year after decades of wrangling over whether to repair the Tappan Zee or build a new bridge. The westbound span of the bridge had been carrying both eastbound and westbound traffic. Eastbound traffic was set to be shifted to the new span after it opened this weekend, but concerns about the stability of the old bridge delayed that shift. The new bridge, which connects Rockland and Westchester Counties, is a two-span cable-stayed design, with the cables holding up its steel decks anchored to the tops of the angled central towers rather than to the shore. The old Tappan Zee was closed to traffic in October and was being disassembled piece by piece. By December, each end of the bridge had been removed so that it did not connect to either bank of the Hudson River. As the Democratic primary in New York on Thursday approaches, Mr. Cuomo’s opponents seized on the problem with the old bridge, with some suggesting that Mr. Cuomo prematurely announced the opening of the span of the new bridge. The goal had been to fully open the new bridge in 2018, and Mr. Cuomo said last month that he was looking at a mid-September completion.
0~North Korea Says It Has Detonated Its First Hydrogen Bomb~WASHINGTON — North Korea declared on Tuesday that it had detonated its first hydrogen bomb. The assertion, if true, would dramatically escalate the nuclear challenge from one of the world’s most isolated and dangerous states. In an announcement, North Korea said that the test had been a “complete success.” But it was difficult to tell whether the statement was true. North Korea has made repeated claims about its nuclear capabilities that outside analysts have greeted with skepticism. “This is the self-defensive measure we have to take to defend our right to live in the face of the nuclear threats and blackmail by the United States and to guarantee the security of the Korean Peninsula,” a female North Korean announcer said, reading the statement on Central Television, the state-run network. The North’s announcement came about an hour after detection devices around the world had picked up a 5.1 seismic event along the country’s northeast coast.
0~Netanyahu, Facing Tough Israel Election, Pledges to Annex a Third of West Bank~JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said Tuesday that he would move swiftly to annex nearly a third of the occupied West Bank if voters returned him to power in the election next week, seizing what he called a historic opportunity from a sympathetic White House to give Israel “secure, permanent borders.” His plan to annex territory along the Jordan River would reshape the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and would reduce any future Palestinian state to an enclave encircled by Israel. Mr. Netanyahu’s rivals on the left and right largely greeted the announcement, made in the heat of a campaign in which he is battling for survival, as a transparent political ploy. Mr. Netanyahu said he planned to annex all Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and that he would move immediately after forming a new government to annex the Jordan Valley, a strategic and fertile strip of territory along the border with Jordan that runs from Beit Shean in northern Israel to the shores of the Dead Sea.
0~Gunman Kills 4 Marines at Military Site in Chattanooga~RESTRICTION SUMMARY: AP CLIENTS ONLY SHOTLIST: AP TELEVISION - AP CLIENTS ONLY Washington, DC - 16 July 2015 1. Mid, TV crews walking into Oval Office 2. SOUNDBITE (English) Barack Obama, US President: “I just received a briefing from FBI Director Comey as well as my White House team about the tragic shooting that took place in Chattanooga today. We don’t know yet all the details. We know that what appears to be a lone gunman carried out these attacks. We’ve identified a name and at this point a full investigation is taking place. The FBI will be taking the lead, working closely with local law enforcement. But we’ve also been in contact with the Department of Defense to make sure that all our defense facilities remain properly attentive and vigilant as we sort through exactly what happened. And, as details of the investigation proceed, we will make sure that the FBI as well as local law enforcement are providing the public with all the information that is involved. My main message right now is, obviously, the deepest sympathies of the American people to the four Marines that have been killed. It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals who have served our country with great valor to be killed in this fashion. And, although the families are still in the process of being contacted, I want them to know that I speak for the American people in expressing our deepest condolences and knowing that they have our full support as they try to overcome the grief that is involved here. I also want to say that there are reports of injuries to Chattanooga local law enforcement officials. Thankfully as we know at this point they have survived the assault and they know that we are thinking of them, our thoughts and prayers. We take all shootings very seriously. Obviously when you have an attack on a US military facility then we have to make sure that we have all the information necessary to make an assessment in terms of how this attack took place and what further precautions we can take in the future. And, as we have more information we’ll let the public know. But in the meantime I would ask all Americans to pray for the families who are grief stricken at this point and I want everybody to understand that we will be thorough and prompt in figuring out what has happened. Thank you very much.”
0~Warren G. Magnuson Dies at 84; Held Powerful Positions in Senate~Senator Magnuson was the driving force behind much notable legislation, including bills on health policy and safety standards. He was a consistent friend of organized labor and fought for the country's merchant fleet. Mr. Magnuson championed water and public power projects, seeing to it that his state got its share and then some. Labeled Big Spender But his years and the tide of Reagan conservatism caught up with Mr. Magnuson. When he sought his seventh term in 1980, his detractors focused on his pork-barrel politics and labeled him a liberal big spender. While his age was rarely mentioned directly, it clearly was on the public's mind. Hard of hearing and walking with a shuffle, he avoided the rigors of the stump and refused to debate. He also refused to listen to close associates who advised him to retire while he was on top. The senior member of the Senate, he lost his last and toughest campaign to Washington's state Attorney General, Slade Gorton, as the Republicans carried the Senate for Mr. Reagan. Scandinavian Ancestry Warren Grant Magnuson, of Luthern Scandinavian ancestry, was born April 12, 1905, in Moorhead, Minn. Orphaned as an infant, he was adopted by a Swedish couple, William G. and Emma Magnuson. He attended high school in his native town but at age 17 began to work his way west, riding the freights, He roamed the Northwest as a farm hand at harvest time and then worked his way through college, enrolling at the University of Washington in 1924 and leaving with a law degree in 1929. He became a special prosecuting attorney in Seattle for King County. Mr. Magnuson won a seat in the state Legislature in 1932, was elected King County prosecutor in 1934 and went to Washington in January 1937 representing the First District in Seattle.
0~Musk Brings in New Investors to Contribute $7 Billion to Twitter Deal~In numerous conversations over the last several days, Elon Musk began making promises about what he could do with Twitter. Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man, told potential investors that he could double the number of users on the platform to more than half a billion by 2025, four people briefed on the conversations said. Not only that, he said, he could more than double Twitter’s revenue by that date and bring tens of millions of paying subscribers to the service, two of the people said. Mr. Musk added that investors would make a handsome return if they bought into his pitch. And he told them that he would take charge of Twitter, at least for a time, as its chief executive. Investors bought in. On Thursday, Mr. Musk revealed that he had raised around $7 billion from 18 entities to help fund his blockbuster $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. The investors were a mix of Mr. Musk’s Silicon Valley friends — including venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and tech moguls like Larry Ellison — as well as cryptocurrency companies, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, property firms and mutual-fund companies.
0~Book Review: ‘The Revolutionary,’ by Stacy Schiff~In her new book, “The Revolutionary,” Stacy Schiff redresses this oversight by celebrating the man who “wired a continent for rebellion.” There is a lot to admire about this rabble-rouser. He was utterly incorruptible; colonial authorities tried to buy him off with public office (“the time-honored method”), but Adams could be neither bribed nor intimidated. He cared nothing for personal gain, and, in his own words, gloried “in being what the world calls a poor man.” He was deeply idealistic, had great personal equanimity and was a gifted orator. He promoted public education for women long before it was fashionable. He was a tender father to his two children and, although his financial mismanagement forced his wife into manual labor while he was at the Second Continental Congress, he was also a loving husband. Readers are reminded more than once that Adams abhorred slavery, and when offered the gift of an enslaved woman, he insisted that she be freed before joining his household. Schiff paints a vivid portrait of a demagogue who was also a decorous man of ideals, acknowledging Adams’s innovative, extralegal activities as well as his personal virtues. Any book from the Pulitzer Prize-winning Schiff is reason for excitement. Her previous subjects, including Véra Nabokov, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and Cleopatra, have established her as one of the most talented and creative biographers at work today. Readers interested in the American Revolution or the ability of individuals to destabilize political institutions will find her new book rewarding. This brisk narrative of the outsize role that Adams played in colonial Massachusetts during the “messy, anarchic, provocative years” before the Revolution places the reader at the center of the action, while dramatic events, including the Boston Massacre and Tea Party, unfold anew in the light of Adams’s involvement. Schiff writes beautifully and lyrical passages provide a great deal of reading pleasure. We learn that the fall of 1774 was so warm “you could write at an open window through the end of October,” and she describes British troops marching on Lexington as forming a “gleaming quarter-mile ribbon of red coats, snow-white linen flashing … moving through the pale morning light, in perfect order, at an impressively brisk pace.” “The Revolutionary” is also filled with fun facts: In the colonial era, class rank at Harvard was determined not by a student’s intellectual prowess but by his father’s social status. Malt makers kept pigs that were fed on spent grain. The number of shillings in a dollar varied by colony. Supporters of the boycott against the East India Company spread rumors that its tea was infested with plague, carried smallpox and bred a flea-like insect. Samuel Adams lived 81 years; “The Revolutionary” is primarily concerned with 15 of them, starting in 1764 when Adams was 41. There is less here about his early life, his family or his post-revolutionary career, which found Adams arguing in favor of annexing Canada and Spanish Florida, supporting a ban on theaters in Boston as part of a futile struggle to maintain the virtuous citizenry he believed essential to the success of the new Republic, and, finally, serving as a largely ineffectual governor of Massachusetts. Because Adams left behind so few papers, Schiff largely relies on the views of his peers. Most of what we learn about him comes from two men: his nemesis, the Loyalist Massachusetts governor Thomas Hutchinson, and an adoring younger second cousin, the future president John Adams. John described his cousin as a man of “refined policy, steadfast integrity, exquisite humanity, genteel erudition, obliging, engaging manners, real as well as professed piety and a universal good character.” Hutchinson doubted that there was, in the English-speaking world, a “man of greater malignity of heart,” or one “who less scruples any measures, ever so criminal, to accomplish his purposes.” What the two commentators shared was a generous respect for Adams’s powers. They saw, as Schiff also does, Adams’s hand in virtually every anti-British action in Massachusetts.

0~Fed Chair Warns the Economy May Need More as Congress Hesitates~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” [music] Today: Saving the U.S. economy from the fallout of the pandemic may require a historic infusion of cash. Ben Casselman on the debate over that spending. Its Monday, May 18. Ben, we’re talking to you on Friday morning, and a bunch of big, ugly, economic numbers just came out this morning. So we wanted to sift through them with you. ben casselman Yeah. It’s been a pretty dark morning for the economy. michael barbaro Where do you think we should start? ben casselman Maybe the place to start is actually on Thursday. archived recording We turn now to the economy. Nearly 3 million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. ben casselman When we learned that another 3 million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits. archived recording That’s more than 36 million people in two months. ben casselman We’re two months into this crisis, and yet we are still losing millions of jobs every week. archived recording For eight straight weeks now, jobless claims have been in the millions with 3 million more people filing for unemployment last week. michael barbaro Right. Every week. ben casselman Every week. archived recording This did not happen naturally. All of these companies didn’t just go out of business because demand disappeared. We turned our economy off. Right? Think about New York. Think about the state of California. If you ran a restaurant, a mini golf course, or a clothing store, there’s a really good chance you would have laid your workers off. ben casselman And then, Friday morning, we get up. archived recording It’s the services industries that are getting crushed here. ben casselman And we learn that retail sales in April were down more than 16 percent. That’s by far the worst that we’ve ever seen. archived recording But as far as these retail sales go, worse than expected month over month. ben casselman Over the last two months, restaurants lost half their business. Apparel and clothing stores have lost nearly 90 percent of their business. archived recording The country’s shut down, and people aren’t buying stuff. I hate to state the obvious, but they’re not buying cars, down 12 percent. They’re not buying furnishings and home furnishing items, down 58 percent. Clothing and clothing accessories, down 78 percent. ben casselman And then we got another data point that said that industrial production, right, this is the actual stuff that we make in the economy, was down by the most in more than a century that we’ve been keeping records, meaning worse than the Great Depression. michael barbaro In other words, as bad as it gets. ben casselman As bad as it has ever gotten. We know that this is deep. We know that it is broad-based. We don’t yet know how long it will last. And that’s the fundamental question going forward. michael barbaro So given all that, I want to turn to a speech. archived recording Good morning. It’s my pleasure and privilege to welcome back Chair Jay Powell. michael barbaro That the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, made a couple of days ago, that I think speaks to all this data. ben casselman Yeah. michael barbaro And of course, the chairman of the Federal Reserve doesn’t make a ton of speeches, so I know that his words carry a lot of weight. ben casselman Yeah. So Jerome Powell comes out. archived recording (jerome powell) The coronavirus has left a devastating human and economic toll in its wake. ben casselman Of course, he’s giving the speech remotely, so he’s in front of these blue curtains — or maybe they’re digitally superimposed blue curtains, I’m not actually sure — on a Zoom-style call. But he comes out with this really stark message. archived recording (jerome powell) The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent. ben casselman And he’s saying, this economic crisis is incredibly deep. archived recording (jerome powell) We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and employment. ben casselman It’s incredibly broad. archived recording (jerome powell) And already, the job gains of the last decade have been erased. ben casselman And it is hitting the most vulnerable workers more than anyone. He has this line early in the speech where he says — archived recording (jerome powell) While we’re all affected. ben casselman “While we are all affected” — archived recording (jerome powell) The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it. ben casselman — “The burden has fallen most heavily on those least able to bear it.” archived recording (jerome powell) Among people who were working in February, almost 40 percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year, had lost a job in March. ben casselman Lower income Americans, black Americans, less educated Americans. archived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well. The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy. michael barbaro And Ben Powell talks about this specter of permanent economic damage in this speech, and perhaps he was referring most urgently to these lower income workers. But I want to understand that concept, because it feels a little bit new to me. I think of almost all economic conditions as temporary. So what did he mean by that? ben casselman You’re right to think about most economic conditions as temporary, because historically, that is the way economists have thought about recessions and economic downturns — is some people lose their jobs, and then they get those jobs back when things get better. Some businesses lose business, or maybe they go out of business, but other things come back up and replace them. But we’ve learned over time that that is not the way recessions always work, and especially long and deep recessions. That when people lose their jobs, if they’re out of work for too long, they can drift away from the labor market. They can lose their connections, and all of a sudden, even when the economy starts to get better, it’s very hard for them to get back to work. michael barbaro I wonder if you can give me an example of this to bring it to life. ben casselman Well, imagine a small company, right, that maybe somebody has spent their lives, maybe a couple generations building. You could imagine if this crisis were to last a few weeks, they lose some revenue, they take a hit, but they start right back up where they left off. But as this drags on and they fall behind on loans, you fall behind on your rent payments, and all of a sudden, you can get to a place where you can’t reopen that business, where you can’t restart. And sure, the business owner might be able to go and find another job, but that business is lost forever. michael barbaro And so that is what Powell is referring to when he talks about permanent economic damage from this pandemic. ben casselman That’s what Powell fears, and that’s what he wants to make sure we avoid. michael barbaro What kind of solution, what kind of plan does he have in mind in this speech to avoid permanent economic damage? ben casselman Well, Powell starts by talking about all the things that we have already done, and he’s full of praise for that. archived recording (jerome powell) The response here in the United States has been particularly swift and forceful. ben casselman He talks about what the Fed itself has done, of course, but he also talks about — archived recording (jerome powell) To date, Congress has provided roughly $2.9 trillion. ben casselman — what Congress has done, the nearly $3 trillion in emergency spending that Congress has approved. archived recording (jerome powell) For households, businesses, health care providers and state and local governments. ben casselman And there are a lot of programs that Congress has enacted to try to deal with this, right? They’ve written checks to virtually every American. They’ve offered loans and grants to businesses, and Powell says that all of those things have been incredibly important to softening the blow of this crisis. archived recording (jerome powell) The overall policy response to date has provided a measure of relief and stability and will provide some support to the recovery, when it comes. ben casselman But then, he says — archived recording (jerome powell) But the coronavirus crisis raises longer term concerns as well. ben casselman — basically, we’re not done yet. michael barbaro That that was not enough. ben casselman That it probably won’t be enough. That we know now that this is not a crisis that is going to last for just a month or just a couple of months. It’s going to drag on. And that as it drags on, if the government doesn’t step in and do enough to keep people and businesses afloat, then we’re going to see a lot more of that kind of permanent damage that Powell is talking about. michael barbaro And when he suggests that we aren’t done yet, what is he really saying? ben casselman What he’s really saying is to Congress, you need to keep spending. The Fed will do what it can do, but the Fed can only lend money. It’s Congress that has the ability to spend money, to give money to people, to give money to businesses. And that is, in all likelihood, what it will take to get through this period. He describes what’s been done so far as a bridge, a bridge across temporary interruptions, he says. And what he’s basically saying is the bridge doesn’t yet reach all the way across the river. And a bridge doesn’t do you much good if it stops when you’re still over water. michael barbaro No. It does not. Is that normal for the chairman of the Fed to do this, to be advising Congress to spend a lot more money in this manner? ben casselman Not in as direct terms as this. But this was, at least by the standards of Fed chairs, a pretty direct call to action. archived recording (jerome powell) Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it, if it helps avoid long term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This trade-off is one for our elected representatives who wield powers of taxation and spending. michael barbaro And can we safely assume that when the chairman of the Federal Reserve tells Congress, this is what I think you should do, that he assumes that that is what Congress will do? ben casselman Oh, I don’t think we should assume that Powell thinks that Congress will do it. But I think Powell knew that he was speaking at a moment when there’s a major political debate that’s playing out between Democrats and Republicans about what the role of government is in this crisis. And he’s, in effect, weighing in on one side of that debate, but I don’t think he’s under any illusion that he alone will resolve it. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. [music] michael barbaro So Ben, describe the divisions between Democrats and Republicans in Congress about this advice from Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. ben casselman Well, think back for a moment to those trillions of dollars in spending that have already taken place. archived recording (charles grassley) I want to highlight a few areas of bipartisan economic relief we will be voting on today. Recovery checks to give Americans needed cash to provide for their families. ben casselman When Congress approved those measures, it was really bipartisan. michael barbaro Right. archived recording (chuck schumer) This is a strange and evil disease. There is much we still don’t know about it, and it is keeping us apart. ben casselman But that came at a moment when the economy was in the process of shutting down, and there was pretty widespread agreement that that had to happen. archived recording (chuck schumer) When we passed this bill, instead of hugging each other, we’ll wave from a distance. None of us can know when this plague will pass. The only thing we know for sure is that we must summon the same spirit that saw previous generations through America’s darkest hours. ben casselman We’re now in a very different moment. archived recording Democratic leader. archived recording (chuck schumer) Well, it’s been two weeks since Leader McConnell called us back into session. ben casselman Where there are real divisions between Republicans and Democrats about how quickly reopening should take place. archived recording (chuck schumer) In that time, it was announced that 30 million Americans filed for unemployment. And yet the Republican leader has scheduled exactly zero votes, zero, on legislation related to the coronavirus crisis. ben casselman And with that comes real disagreement about the role of the federal government in continuing to support businesses and especially workers. archived recording (chuck schumer) Let’s solve the problem right now. What are we going to do for people who are out of work? ben casselman The Democrats are by and large saying, much of the country is still shut down. archived recording (chuck schumer) What are we going to do for businesses that are going under? ben casselman And so the government has to continue to support workers and businesses. It has to keep on spending. The Republican side is a little more complicated. archived recording (mitch mcconnell) This emergency is very serious. So the Senate’s response has been serious. ben casselman It’s not unanimous, but there is certainly, at least in Congress, more of an inclination to say — archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, here in the real world, Senate Republicans are working seriously to help the country reopen. ben casselman Let’s see how this reopening process goes. Let’s see if the businesses reopen, and if they do, maybe we don’t need to do very much more. And if they don’t come back and there’s a need for further action, then we can talk about that then. michael barbaro So it’s a bit more of a wait and see whether Congress really needs to spend all that much more money. ben casselman That’s right, and that question of spending is what’s hanging over this. The Republicans are looking at the trillions, with a T, that have been spent so far and saying, can we wait to spend more? archived recording (mitch mcconnell) The crushing unemployment figures show us that no amount of federal spending could substitute for the entirety of the U.S. economy. We need to be smart, and we need to be safe, but we have to find a more sustainable middle ground. michael barbaro Ben, how tied are these different approaches to the long-standing economic ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties? ben casselman Well, look, Republicans have a long-standing discomfort with programs like unemployment insurance. archived recording (john coryn) At a certain point, these benefits are going to do more harm than good, and I would say they already are starting to do that. So extending unemployment benefits through next year would deter people from trying to return to work, because why would they? Why would someone choose to do more work for less money? ben casselman So it’s not surprising that as we move from the acute phase of this crisis into the long, slow recovery, that Republicans would be the first to start raising questions about the spending and to start thinking about pulling back on some of those programs. archived recording (john coryn) So we’re already looking at staggering debt that we are going to have to deal with at some point, because it’s immoral to expect our kids and grandkids to pay that money back after we’ve already cashed those checks. ben casselman Democrats have long advocated for more generous unemployment benefits, for a larger role for government, and so it’s not too surprising that they are more comfortable with these programs lasting longer. archived recording (elizabeth warren) We need to show that we have a government that understands the scale of this problem and understands that the approach to it is to get money down into the hands of the people who will put it down at the grassroots level and help support this economy from the ground up. michael barbaro And so this is the long-standing, very inflexible ideological terrain that Powell is entering when he goes to Congress and says, hey, cough up trillions of dollars more. ben casselman That’s right. michael barbaro But it feels like in this debate, the real anxiety is over just the enormity of the scale of money that we’re talking about. And I feel at this point, I have to ask you the question that we all pretend to know the answer to, which is: Where does all this money come from that Powell is suggesting Congress spend and that Democrats and Republicans are not really agreeing on whether to spend? ben casselman In the simplest terms, we’re borrowing it. The congressional budget office projects that the deficit this year will be $3.7 trillion. michael barbaro And we’re borrowing those trillions of dollars from whom? ben casselman So Congress decides how much it’s going to spend, and it of course sets tax rates as well. And any time that Congress decides to spend more than it brings in in tax rates, then the Treasury Department has to sell bonds to make up the difference. And that just means that it’s asking people, investors, foreign governments to lend the United States money. You give us money now, we’ll give you money back with a small amount of interest in anywhere from a few days to 10 years. michael barbaro Right. So when we hear about treasury bonds and their yields, that is the interest payment that the U.S. government is giving to someone who buys a treasury bond, and then the process has lent money to the U.S. and to Congress. ben casselman That’s right. Every time the government sells a bond, it’s borrowing money from the public. It’s paying some interest on that, just like if you borrowed money to buy a house or to make a purchase, to buy a car. The only difference is the federal government gets a much better interest rate than you or I ever will. michael barbaro So we kind of become the bank. ben casselman We become the bank. michael barbaro And to hear someone like Jerome Powell describe it, that doesn’t seem all that risky for Congress to spend all that money, which would require the U.S. borrowing that much from us and anyone who wants to buy U.S. treasury bonds. But is it risky? ben casselman So in the short term, there’s really no risk here. We can keep borrowing, as long as people will keep lending us money. In the long term, of course, we have to make good on those loans. michael barbaro Right. ben casselman And we have to pay interest on those loans. And so there will certainly be a debate when we come out the other side of this crisis about what the government should do about these huge deficits. But that debate is still years away. Because we’re at a very particular moment right now, which is that we’re in the middle of an immediate crisis. And if we don’t get our economy back on track, then none of that longer run debate matters. That debate is conditional on having an economy at all on the other side of this. michael barbaro Right. So you could have an economy with little debt, but you might not have much of an economy at all. ben casselman Yeah. Powell is saying, the debt is the least of our worries right now. It’s not that it doesn’t matter. It’s not that it will never matter. But we have to try to get the economy through this period and moving again, before we can worry about any of those other long-run concerns. You could think about it like performing CPR. Right? Performing CPR often involves breaking ribs, and that’s a real consequence. But that doesn’t mean you don’t perform CPR. You perform CPR, you try to get somebody whose heart started again, and then you worry about the other consequences once the person’s heart is beating again. michael barbaro And just to be clear, in this metaphor the broken ribs is massive U.S. debt spending on stimulus. ben casselman And the heart is the American economy, which right now is stopped and which we somehow have to get beating again. And so what you now have is Powell and lots of other economists who, like him, would normally be worried about the debt who are saying, now is not the moment. That includes people who were advisers to George W. Bush, people who were advisers to Republican candidates and Republican leaders throughout the last several decades. Pretty much all of the economists that I talk to and that my colleagues have been talking to are saying the same thing, which is now is not the moment to worry about the debt. michael barbaro So if this is the broad consensus of economists across the United States, Ben, why is this much of a debate in Congress at all? ben casselman Economists like to think that they issue these sage pieces of advice, and everybody on Capitol Hill and in statehouses will rush to follow them. But of course, that’s not the way the world works. michael barbaro And so it may well be the case that many members of Congress thank the Federal Reserve chairman but say, you know, we’re not going to follow that advice. ben casselman And we’ve already heard Republicans in Congress saying exactly that. archived recording (mitch mcconnell) Look, we can’t spend enough money to prop this economy up forever. People need to be able to begin to be productive again, consistent with the guidelines that have been laid down by the health care professionals toward opening up the economy.

0~Un estudio indica que el 65 por ciento de los mexicanos opinan negativamente sobre EE. UU.~CIUDAD DE MÉXICO — Los puntos de vista favorables sobre Estados Unidos han descendido abruptamente entre los mexicanos, al alcanzar el nivel más bajo en 15 años mientras existe una profunda desaprobación sobre el gobierno de Trump y su política hacia México, de acuerdo con una encuesta dada a conocer este jueves. Casi dos tercios de los mexicanos tienen ahora una opinión negativa sobre su vecino del norte, más del doble de la proporción en comparación con la de hace dos años, de acuerdo con el estudio realizado por el Pew Research Center. La caída en la percepción favorable fue la más grande entre los 37 países encuestados por Pew. La percepción negativa coincide con un triste concepto de Trump y una de sus principales promesas de campaña. Solo cinco por ciento de los mexicanos tiene la confianza de que Trump hará lo correcto cuando se trate de asuntos internacionales, la calificación más baja del presidente estadounidense en cualquier país, y 94 por ciento se opone a su plan de construir un muro fronterizo entre México y Estados Unidos. Trump también ha puesto en marcha medidas severas para restringir a los migrantes sin papeles —muchos de los cuales son mexicanos— y ha amenazado con retirar a Estados Unidos del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte (TLCAN).
0~Transcript of Mitt Romney’s Speech on Donald Trump~(APPLAUSE) Now, I know that some people want this race to be over. They look at history and say a trend like Mr. Trump’s isn’t going to be stopped. Perhaps. But the rules of political history have pretty much all been shredded during this campaign. (LAUGHTER) If the other candidates can find some common ground, I believe we can nominate a person who can win the general election and who will represent the values and policies of conservatism. Given the current delegate selection process, that means that I’d vote for Marco Rubio in Florida and for John Kasich in Ohio and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in a given state. Now let me turn to national security and the safety of our homes and loved ones. Mr. Trump’s bombast is already alarming the allies and fueling the enmity of our enemies. Insulting all Muslims will keep many of them from fully engaging with us in the urgent fight against ISIS, and for what purpose? Muslim terrorists would only have to lie about their religion to enter the country. And then what he said about on “60 Minutes”. Did you hear this? It was about Syria and ISIS, and it has to go down as the most ridiculous and dangerous idea of the entire campaign season. Let ISIS take out Assad, he said, and then we can pick up the remnants. How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause. Learn more about our process. Now, think about that. Let the most dangerous terror organization the world has ever known take over an entire country? This recklessness is recklessness in the extreme. Now, Donald Trump tells us that he is very, very smart. (LAUGHTER) I’m afraid that when it comes to foreign policy he is very, very not smart. (APPLAUSE) Now, I’m far from the first to conclude that Donald Trump lacks the temperament to be president. After all, this is an individual who mocked a disabled reporter, who attributed a reporter’s questions to her menstrual cycle, who mocked a brilliant rival who happened to be a woman due to her appearance, who bragged about his marital affairs, and who laces his public speeches with vulgarity.
0~Emanuel Rackman, Prominent Rabbi, Dies at 98~Emanuel Rackman, the spiritual leader of the prominent Fifth Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan and an outspoken advocate of a more inclusive, intellectually open Orthodox Judaism, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 98. The death was confirmed by his granddaughter Jessica Rackman. A lawyer and a Talmudist by training, Rabbi Rackman argued for a more flexible interpretation of Orthodoxy and the relevance of traditional Jewish law to modern life. “Perhaps, like Socrates, I corrupt youth, but I do teach that Judaism encourages doubt, even as it enjoins faith and commitment,” he wrote in Commentary in 1966. “A Jew dare not live with absolute certainty not only because certainty is the hallmark of the fanatic and Judaism abhors fanaticism, but also because doubt is good for the human soul, its humility, and consequently its greater potential ultimately to discover its Creator.” Rabbi Rackman was born in Albany, the son of a businessman and Talmudist who was descended from six generations of rabbis. He studied at the Talmudical Academy in New York, the high school affiliate of Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, where he continued his Talmudic studies while attending Columbia University, which awarded him a law degree in 1933 and a doctorate in public law in 1952. In 1934 he was ordained a rabbi.
0~Justice Department to Investigate Jacob Blake Shooting~“What our city needs right now is healing,” Mr. Frey said at a news conference with the city police chief, Medaria Arradondo, on Wednesday night. “We do not need more destruction. We do not need property damage that is unacceptable in every way, shape and form, and I want to be very clear: It will not be tolerated.” Later Wednesday evening, the police released video of the man shooting himself, saying it was important to quell rumors that he had been killed by the police. “People need to know the facts,” Chief Arradondo said, as he echoed the mayor’s demand that people leave the downtown. The new unrest came as protesters took to the streets elsewhere to condemn the shooting of Mr. Blake in Kenosha. Protesters in Portland, Ore., continued their nightly demonstrations that have lasted for three months, with Wednesday night’s march billed as being in solidarity with Kenosha. A crowd of about 200 marched to a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, where federal officers came out to confront the crowd. Some protesters threw projectiles, and federal officers pursued them with tear gas and other crowd-control munitions. Local police officers later made a series of arrests on nearby streets. To the south, in Oakland, Calif., hundreds of protesters of protesters took to the streets in solidarity, with a march that began peacefully with a few hundred people calling for justice. Jacob Blake’s name was spray-painted on some boarded storefronts, and some protesters chanted the name of Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old Black man who was killed in the city in 2009.
0~Brian Kemp Resigns as Georgia Secretary of State, With Governor’s Race Still Disputed~ATLANTA — Brian Kemp, the Republican who has claimed victory in the Georgia governor’s race, said on Thursday that he was resigning as secretary of state, removing himself from the process of determining whether he had in fact been elected. With some ballots still to be counted, his Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, is just shy of enough votes to force a runoff. Ms. Abrams has not conceded, and The Associated Press and other major news organizations say the race is still too close to call. Mr. Kemp attracted mounting criticism during the campaign for his management of an election in which he was also a candidate, but he had dismissed repeated calls from Democrats for him to resign in the weeks before Election Day. Mr. Kemp made no mention of the elections process on Thursday in his resignation letter to the outgoing Republican governor, Nathan Deal, saying he was resigning because he wished “to focus on the transition to my gubernatorial administration.”
0~Lawsuit Says 16 Elite Colleges Are Part of Price-Fixing Cartel~A lawsuit filed in federal court on Sunday accused 16 of the nation’s leading private universities and colleges of conspiring to reduce the financial aid they award to admitted students through a price-fixing cartel. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago on behalf of five former undergraduates who attended some of the universities named in the suit, takes aim at a decades-old antitrust exemption granted to these universities for financial aid decisions and claims that the colleges have overcharged an estimated 170,000 students who were eligible for financial aid over nearly two decades. The universities accused of wrongdoing are Brown, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Georgetown, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern, Notre Dame, the University of Pennsylvania, Rice, Vanderbilt and Yale. The allegations hinge on a methodology for calculating financial need. The 16 schools collaborate in an organization called the 568 Presidents Group that uses a consensus approach to evaluating a student’s ability to pay, according to the lawsuit.
0~U.S. to Send 600 More Troops to Iraq to Help Retake Mosul From ISIS~WASHINGTON — President Obama has authorized sending an additional 600 American troops to Iraq to assist Iraqi forces in the looming battle to take back the city of Mosul from the Islamic State, United States officials said on Wednesday. The announcement means that there will soon be 5,000 American troops in Iraq, seven years after the Obama administration withdrew all American troops from the country. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has criticized both Mr. Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, for that decision. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, traveling in New Mexico, said the additional troops would help with logistics as well as providing intelligence for Iraqi security forces in the fight for Mosul. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week that Iraqi forces would be ready to retake the city by early October. “These are military forces that will be deployed to intensify the strategy that’s in place, to support Iraqi forces as they prepare for an offensive,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday.
0~G.M. Says New Wave of Trump Tariffs Could Force U.S. Job Cuts~General Motors warned Friday that if President Trump pushed ahead with another wave of tariffs, the move could backfire, leading to “less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages” for its employees. The automaker said that the president’s threat to impose tariffs on imports of cars and car parts — along with an earlier spate of penalties — could drive vehicle prices up by thousands of dollars. The “hardest hit” cars, General Motors said in comments submitted to the Commerce Department, are likely to be the ones bought by consumers who can least afford an increase. Demand would suffer and production would slow, all of which “could lead to a smaller G.M.” The president has promoted tariffs as a way to protect American businesses and workers, aiming at dozens of nations with metal tariffs, as well as bringing broader levies against Chinese goods. But companies, which rely on other markets for sales, production and materials, have been increasingly vocal about the potential damage from his policies. The warning by G.M., echoed in comments by trade groups and other automakers, could test the president’s aggressive approach to trade and his commitment to business. In the past, Mr. Trump has lauded General Motors for its job creation and vowed to defend the auto industry.
0~The Screen: 'Pillow Talk'~"A NICE, old-fashioned device of the theatre, the telephone party line, serves as a quaint convenience to bring together Rock Hudson and Doris Day in what must be cheerfully acknowledged one of the most lively and up-to-date comedy-romances of the year. ""Pillow Talk"" is the item, and it was dually presented last night at the Palace and the new Murray Hill Theatre, 160 East Thirty-fourth Street.""Bring together"" may be slightly ambiguous and misleading to describe the precise liaison that the telephone accomplishes here, for the first result of the two principals' sharing the same line is a cool and remote antipathy. Miss Day as a fashionable interior decorator and Mr. Hudson as a successful song writer in New York initially insult each other as unidentified voices at either end of their party line.Particularly, Miss Day hates Mr. Hudson because every time she picks up her phone she hears him burbling the same corny love song to an amazing variety of cooing girls. And he hates her because her angry interruptions convey an image of an envious old maid.But once the romantic song writer gets a secret peek at Miss Day and realizes how wrong is his impression, the ""bringing together"" begins, and the telephone and Mr. Hudson's impersonation of an ardent Texan are combined to ""push the romance from there.It is really the clever, witty screen play that Stanley Shapiro and Maurice Richlin have prepared from a story by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene that accounts for much of the sparkle in this film. Their devices are crisp, their dialogue funny and their cinema mechanics are neat. Frequent clever use of a split screen make for fresh and appropriate drolleries. With a CinemaScope screen to play on, they and director Michael Gordon have much fun.And this fun is transmitted to the audience in an easy and generous flow of ingeniously graphic situations and nimble repartee. The opportunity for the tricky song writer to court the lady through a wicked pretense of being a high-minded Texan is in Mr. Hudson's groove, and he carries off the delicate deception with surprising dexterity.""You give me a real warm feeling,"" he softly drawls to Miss Day. ""like a potbellied stove on a frosty morning.""What girl could resist that line?Well, certainly not the young lady played fiercely and smartly by Miss Day, who has a delightful way of taking the romantic offensive against a man. Her dudgeons are as chic and spectacular as her nifty Jean Louis clothes, and her fall for Mr. Hudson's deceptions is as graceful as a ski-run down a hill. Singing is kept to a minimum, but Miss Day does cut loose a couple of times, very pleasantly, as usual. Perry Blackwell also sings two bistro songs.In support of Miss Day and Mr. Hudson are Thelma Ritter as an alcoholic maid and Tony Randall as a disappointed suitor, than whom no others could be more droll. Nick Adams as a wolfish Harvard senior almost steals one sequence from Miss Day, and Marcel Dallio, Allen Jenkins and Lee Patrick are fun in a couple of scenes.Color and some likeable music brighten this pretty film, which has a splendid montage of New York in it. Thank Universal for the boon.

0~A Ransacked Endowment at New York City Opera~"In City Opera’s case, financial documents indicate an astonishing lack of financial discipline leading up to the opera’s 2008 request to invade the endowment, a period when the board’s chairwoman was Susan L. Baker and the general and artistic director was Paul Kellogg. Ms. Baker, who had joined the board in 1999 and became chairwoman in 2004, worked briefly at Goldman Sachs early in her career. Mr. Kellogg, unfailingly described as a gentleman, nonetheless clashed with Ms. Baker, according to a 2012 account in Opera News, and he left in 2007 with no successor in place. The next year, fiscal year 2008, the opera reported an annual deficit of nearly $20 million, which included the $9.5 million investment loss. According to City Opera’s court submission, it had run up deficits of $3.3 million in 2002, $6.3 million in 2003, $3.9 million in 2004, $5.6 million in 2005, and nearly $3 million in 2006. To pay its bills, City Opera borrowed $9.4 million from one of its investment managers (in itself a questionable practice) by the end of fiscal 2008, using the endowment as collateral. As of October 2008, the endowment value was just over $27 million, barely half its value in 2001. Reached by phone, Ms. Baker said she had no comment. Mr. Kellogg did not respond to requests for comment. City Opera’s spokeswoman also declined to comment. According to people with knowledge of the board’s operations, there was no investment committee on the board that oversaw the endowment — a basic requirement of good governance. Nomi P. Ghez, a top-ranked food industry analyst and a former Goldman partner, created such a committee when she joined the board in 2003 and became finance committee chairwoman, according to these people. She also insisted that more than the one money manager then handling the investments manage the endowment. She also warned repeatedly about the unsustainable deficits, and asked that her objections be noted in minutes of board meetings. Still, Ms. Ghez presided over the committee’s 2008 decision to bail out of stocks. Her defenders note that there were other experienced market professionals on the committee who endorsed the decision, and that the board was facing continuing deficits and market turmoil and needed to protect what few assets remained. But, with the benefit of hindsight, the opera should have reinvested the proceeds in stocks in 2009, or shouldn’t have sold at all. Ms. Ghez left the board in 2010 after expressing frustration with the board’s leadership. She declined to comment. With financial markets in turmoil, on Oct. 28, 2008, City Opera asked to invade the restricted endowment financed by the Wallaces, which constituted about 80 percent of City Opera’s endowment. Paula Gellman, an assistant attorney general in the charities bureau, said in court papers she had “carefully reviewed” City Opera’s request, reviewed financial documents, and “conducted discussions with representatives of City Opera and its counsel.” While she raised no objection to City Opera’s petition, she did attach some conditions, which included the requirement that the opera hire “an independent financial adviser” and develop a “viable financial plan” by December 2008. She also took aim at the board’s sloppy financial management, insisting the board evaluate "" the effectiveness of City Opera’s governance, financial and risk management, investment practices and systems of internal controls.” No one at City Opera or in the attorney general’s office contacted the Wallace Foundation, according to Lucas B. Held, the director of communications there, even though invading the endowment contradicted the express terms of the Wallace’s original gift. To the extent practicable, courts are supposed to honor the intent of the donors when granting requests to invade an endowment. Had City Opera not been able to take money from the endowment, and if it subsequently failed, the proceeds would probably have been returned to Lincoln Center and its resident companies, including the Metropolitan Opera, which was a favorite beneficiary of Lila Acheson Wallace."
0~Supreme Court to Hear Case on EPA's Power to Limit Carbon Emissions~In January, on the last full day of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, a federal appeals court in Washington struck down his administration’s plan to relax restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The move cleared the way for the Biden administration to issue stronger restrictions. A divided three-judge panel of the court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, ruled that the Trump administration’s plan, called the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, was based on a “fundamental misconstruction” of the relevant law, prompted by a “tortured series of misreadings.” The panel did not reinstate a 2015 Obama-era regulation, the Clean Power Plan, which would have forced utilities to move away from coal and toward renewable energy to reduce emissions. But it rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to repeal and replace that rule with what critics said was a toothless one. How Times reporters cover politics.

The Obama-era plan had aimed to cut emissions from the power sector by 32 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. To do so, it instructed every state to draft plans to eliminate carbon emissions from power plants by phasing out coal and increasing the generation of renewable energy. The measure never came into effect. It was blocked in 2016 by the Supreme Court, which effectively ruled that states did not have to comply with it until a barrage of lawsuits from conservative states and the coal industry had been resolved. That ruling, followed by changes in the Supreme Court’s membership that have moved it to the right, has made environmental groups wary of what the court might do in cases on climate change.
0~Review: At Desert Trip, Rocking Beyond the Hits With a Vengeance~For Mr. Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Mr. Young and the Who, that meant spiking their songs with improvisation. Mr. Dylan has always restlessly rearranged his songs, toying with lyrics and leaving only a few of his recordings’ musical landmarks intact. On Friday night, he recast and zeroed in on some of his most caustic and merciless songs — among them “Masters of War” from 1963, “Ballad of a Thin Man” from 1965 and “Pay in Blood” from 2012 — and sang them with deep cunning and venom coming through his much-weathered voice. Mr. Young has expansive psychedelic jamming in his DNA — his set included a 22-minute “Down by the River” — while the Stones and the Who are built around guitarists who constantly claw at their songs from within. Keith Richards and Ron Wood, the Stones’ guitarists, played nonstop games of syncopation and suspense amid the band’s well-known riffs, while Mr. Jagger raced all over the stage without missing a note. Pete Townshend of the Who set off countless controlled detonations in his songs — trilling, jabbing rapidly, bending notes, scraping his strings, flinging and windmilling a dozen kinds of power chords — while Roger Daltrey swung his microphone on its cord and flaunted his lung power. Although he reveled in the stuttering that has always been part of “My Generation,” Mr. Daltrey took care to enunciate one line quite clearly for the Oldchella audience: “Hope I die before I get old.” For Mr. Waters and Mr. McCartney, whose music is more meticulously controlled, executing old songs anew meant updated spectacle and significance. Mr. Waters did a full set of material from his former band, Pink Floyd, often playing groups of songs to revisit the way the band’s concept albums inexorably build. He has a rare ability to make slow songs majestic rather than tedious; his rock dirges can open like chasms underfoot, accompanied onstage (as they have been through the years) by up-to-the-minute video technology. Mr. Waters placed opposition to Donald J. Trump at the core of his set, showing images of the candidate (in, among other things, a Ku Klux Klan hood) on video and on a flying inflatable pig during the bluesy, condemnatory “Pigs (Three Different Ones).”
0~The History Behind the Birthright Citizenship Battle~The 14th Amendment, which declared that African-Americans were citizens, turned 150 earlier this month. But even as it was being commemorated as one of the signal achievements of post-Civil War Reconstruction, its bedrock provisions were colliding with the furious 21st-century debate over immigration. In June, President Trump tweeted that undocumented immigrants should be sent home “immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases”— a direct contravention, legal scholars pointed out, of repeated Supreme Court rulings saying that the amendment’s guarantee of due process applies to all people in the United States, whatever their status. This week, Michael Anton, a former national security official in the Trump administration, wrote an op-ed article in The Washington Post saying that birthright citizenship — the longstanding principle that anyone born in the United States is a citizen — rests on a “deliberate misreading” of the 14th Amendment. The article drew furious responses from scholars on social media and elsewhere. Among those weighing in was Martha S. Jones, a historian at Johns Hopkins University and the author of the new book “Birthright Citizens: A History of Race and Rights in Antebellum America.”
0~Why an Amtrak Train Derailed in Philadelphia~The Northeast Regional Train No. 188 that derailed last year had been traveling at speeds similar to earlier trains along the route from Washington to Philadelphia. Train engineers are expected to memorize the speed restrictions along the route. But just before the accident, Mr. Bostian was distracted by radio transmissions from another train and and lost track of his location on the route, investigators said at the hearing on Tuesday. The investigation focused on Mr. Bostian, who said he had gaps in his memory but remembered growing worried shortly before the derailment when he heard that the windshield of a nearby Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority train had been hit by an object.Mr. Bostian had listened to about two dozen radio transmissions between the dispatcher and the engineer of the stopped commuter train before the derailment, investigators said. As he approached the curve, investigators believe Mr. Bostian thought he was in a stretch of track after the curve, where the speed limit was 110 m.p.h.“Given that it was dark outside, there were fewer visible cues to help him identify his location,” said Dr. Steve Jenner, a safety board investigator.
0~In Making the French Open Final, Djokovic Edges Closer to His Rivals~PARIS — This golden age of men’s tennis got a little shinier on Friday night. It is harder to deepen the impression at this advanced stage: after all the comebacks, marathon duels and winners under pressure over nearly 20 years of close character study. But Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, in their 58th meeting, still found something inside themselves that spoke to their public, which was allowed the privilege of staying in their seats past the 11 p.m. curfew by the French authorities. It was the right move on many levels. It might have prevented a riot, but above all it was welcome because clearing the main Philippe Chatrier Court would have stopped the flow of a great match that was transcendent in part because of the force of its tidal shifts. The third set was the best example, and one of the most compelling sets to be played at Roland Garros: 91 minutes of grit and pure talent reflected in both grinding rallies and bold swipes of the racket from all sorts of compromised positions. No two tennis players have been better at turning defense into offense, and no two men have played each other more often in singles in the Open era. It was 5-0 Nadal after five games, but Djokovic worked his way back with deep focus, channeling his intensity. There were no screams on Friday night like the one he produced after beating Matteo Berrettini on this same court on Wednesday in another late night match.
0~Drone Stunt at Belgrade Soccer Match Stirs Ethnic Tensions~On Thursday evening, the Albanian ambassador to Serbia, Ilir Bocka, who had been summoned by Serbian officials for a stern rebuke, told reporters in Belgrade that efforts were being made to try to save the prime minister’s visit, which both sides had earlier described as an example of a new era of reconciliation. He called on the Serbian authorities to “unequivocally condemn the extremist behavior” of spectators at the match, according to Serbian news media reports. Soccer and nationalism, twin forces in countries as varied as Britain and Brazil, are a particularly potent cocktail when it comes to relations between ethnic Serbs and ethnic Albanians, whose history is marked by civil war and ethnic cleansing. Relations have been particularly tense since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on Feb. 17, 2008, almost a decade after NATO bombs helped eject Serbian forces under Slobodan Milosevic from Kosovo, ending a vicious war against Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian majority. While Serbia vehemently rejected Kosovo’s independence, Albania ardently applauded it, with some Albanians clamoring to make Kosovo part of Albania. Several players on the Albanian team, including its captain, Lorik Cana, were born in Kosovo when it was part of Serbia. The nationalist flag released at the game, which also featured portraits of two Albanian patriotic leaders, was particularly provocative as it depicted a Greater Albania that included Kosovo and parts of neighboring countries like Greece, Macedonia and Montenegro. Petrit Selimi, deputy foreign minister of Kosovo, said it was imperative that the match not be allowed to spoil regional reconciliation, including recently improved ties between Kosovo and Serbia. “I do hope that politicians in both Albania and Serbia will find a way to focus on the progress to be reached in their respective E.U. paths,” he said, “rather than provocations by those hellbent on repeating the violence of the past.” The soccer skirmish rippled across both countries throughout the week, and the Serbian broadcaster B92 reported that several Albanian bakeries in Serbia had been attacked apparently in retaliation, including in Sombor, a town in northern Serbia, where a gasoline bomb was lobbed at a store. Blic, a popular tabloid newspaper, said ethnic Albanian hackers from Kosovo and Albania had attacked its website. In Kosovo, B92 said, ethnic Albanians set fire to a Serbian flag in Mitrovica, an ethnically divided city. The stadium fight even spilled into Austria, where a group of 50 Albanians attacked Serbs dining in a restaurant, the broadcaster said.
0~Greece Obtains Bailout, but Doubts for Region Persist~ATHENS — Greece announced on Sunday that it had reached agreement on a long-delayed financial rescue package that would require years of painful belt-tightening, but the deal might not be enough to stop the spread of economic contagion to other European countries with mounting debts and troubled economies. The bailout, which was worked out over weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and Greece’s European partners, calls for 110 billion euros, or $146 billion, in loans over the next three years intended to avoid a debt default. But analysts warned that Greece had not yet solved its fundamental problems and that other sovereign debt crises could arise as lenders and market speculators turned their attention to a handful of similarly vulnerable nations across southern Europe. “The immediate impact may be soothing, but the inflammation will soon show up again,” said Edward Hugh, an economist in Barcelona who writes for the influential Fistful of Euros blog. “My feeling is the rot has now gone too far.”
0~After Security Breach, Firms Warn of E-Mail Fraud~The marketing firm that suffered the breach, Epsilon, which handles e-mail marketing lists for hundreds of clients, disclosed the problem in a brief statement on Friday. But its sheer scale became clear over the weekend and on Monday, as banks, retailers and others began alerting their customers to be on the lookout for fraudulent e-mails. While e-mail addresses may not seem particularly vulnerable, experts say that if criminals can associate addresses with names and a business like a bank, they can devise highly customized attacks to trick people into disclosing more confidential information, a technique known as “spear phishing.” “Any time you have an organization that loses the contact information of customers for some of the biggest banks in the world, that’s a big deal,” said Brian Krebs, editor of Krebs on Security, a Web site that specializes in online security and crime. “You’ve just given the bad guys a road map between the banks and their customers.” In traditional phishing attacks, criminals e-mail millions of people with a message that appears to be from a bank or other real business, hoping that some of the recipients will be customers of that business and will follow instructions to, for example, “update your account information.” A spear-phishing e-mail is far more dangerous because it can include a person’s name and is sent only to people who are known to be customers of a certain business, greatly increasing the likelihood that the targets will be duped.
0~‘The Batman’ Review: Who’ll Stop the Wayne?~The darkness in “The Batman” is pervasive and literal. Gotham City in the week after Halloween, when this long chapter unfolds, sees about as much sunshine as northern Finland in mid-December. The ambience of urban demoralization extends to the light bulbs, which flicker weakly in the gloom. Bats, cats, penguins and other resident creatures are mostly nocturnal. The relentless rain isn’t the kind that washes the scum off the streets, but the kind that makes a bad mood worse. The Batman — not just any Batman! — is less the enemy of this state of things than its avatar. On television in the 1960s, Batman was playful. Later, in the Keaton-Clooney-Kilmer era of the ’80s and ’90s, he was a bit of a playboy. In the 21st century, through Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” trilogy and after, onscreen incarnations of the character have been purged of any trace of joy, mischief or camp. We know him as a brooding avenger, though not an Avenger, which is a whole different brand of corporate I.P. But a modern superhero is only as authentic as his latest identity crisis. Both the Batman (Robert Pattinson) and “The Batman” itself struggle with the vigilante legacy that has dominated the post-Nolan DC cinematic universe. “I am vengeance,” our hero intones as he swoops down to deal with some minor bad guys. He doesn’t seem happy about it. He’s grouchy and dyspeptic in his costume, and mopey and floppy in his Bruce Wayne mufti.

His parliamentary record as a serial rebel who frequently defied the party line will also make it hard for him to appeal for loyalty. Yet the scale of his win may give Mr. Corbyn some time to establish his leadership. In fact Mr. Corbyn, a vegetarian and teetotaler, had to be persuaded to run as the left’s leadership candidate, and he nearly failed to make the ballot paper. To stand, Mr. Corbyn needed 35 nominations from Labour lawmakers, and he scraped enough together only when several of those who did not support him decided he ought to be on the ballot to broaden the debate within the party. Mr. Corbyn’s victory was then helped by a rule change under which, for just three British pounds, about $4.60, anyone could become a “registered supporter” and take part in the vote. The party, which had around 187,000 members before the May general election, has gained more than 105,000 since, plus 112,000 “registered supporters.” When those affiliated with the party, mainly through unions, are added, more than half a million people had the right to vote, and more than 420,000 ultimately took part. On Saturday, political opponents moved quickly to condemn Labour’s leftward shift. Michael Fallon, the defense secretary, described the opposition party as “a serious risk to our nation’s security, our economy’s security and your family’s security.” “Whether it’s weakening our defenses, raising taxes on jobs and earnings, racking up more debt and welfare or driving up the cost of living by printing money — Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will hurt working people,” he said in a statement. More worrying for Mr. Corbyn will be internal critics. Steven Fielding, professor of political history at Nottingham University, said that the emphatic nature of Mr. Corbyn’s victory made it likely that his opponents would keep quiet for some months, and hope for him to trip up.
0~Saudi Coalition Airstrike Hits School Bus in Yemen, Killing Dozens~IBB, Yemen — An airstrike from the Saudi-led coalition struck a school bus in northern Yemen on Thursday and killed dozens of people, many of them children, local medical officials and international aid groups said. The attack sent a flood of victims to overwhelmed hospitals struggling to cope in what the United Nations considers one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The coalition said it had hit missile launchers and called the attack a “legitimate military operation,” but the attack and the justification for it were condemned and drew new attention to the tremendous human toll of the war in Yemen, especially on children. “No excuses anymore!” Geert Cappelaere, Unicef’s regional director in the Middle East and North Africa, said on Twitter. “Does the world really need more innocent children’s lives to stop the cruel war on children in Yemen?”
0~Faces of the New York Economy; Big Earner, Big Spender, Little Burden~PHILIP G. POTTER, who develops investment products for high-net-worth clients of Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, likes to think of himself as an ''uberconsumer.'' Last year, he spent his bonus on a 50-inch TV and a $3,500 Rolex watch. He wears custom-made $800 suits, custom-made $80 shirts -- always with white collars and white French cuffs -- and $200 shoes. He is ''totally wired,'' as he puts it: His home phone forwards messages to his pager; he answers them over a tiny $800 cellular phone. A member of what he calls the ''young affluent'' class, Mr. Potter, 25 years old, represents the icing on the cake of New York's economy. Though he declined to say exactly how much he earns, he allowed that depending on his bonus, he may well make ''just over the goal line'' of six figures this year. That would put him into the highest city tax bracket, meaning that City Hall will take at least $3,300 from his paycheck.
0~Police Find Car Bomb in Times Square~Inside, they discovered three canisters of propane like those used for barbecue grills, two five-gallon cans of gasoline, consumer-grade fireworks — the apparent source of the “pops” — and two clocks with batteries, the mayor said. He said the device “looked amateurish.” Mr. Browne said: “It appeared it was in the process of detonating, but it malfunctioned.” Bomb squad officers also discovered a two-by-two-by-four-foot metal box — described as a “gun locker” — in the S.U.V. that was taken to the Police Department’s firing range at Rodman’s Neck in the Bronx to be destroyed, Mr. Kelly said. It was not immediately known what, if anything, was inside it. Officials said they had no reports of anyone seen running from the vehicle. Mr. Kelly said police were scouring the area for any additional videotapes but noted that the S.U.V.’s windows were tinted, which could further hamper any efforts to identify those inside. Some of the surveillance cameras nearby were located in closed businesses, and the mayor made clear it would take time to review all available tapes. “We have no idea who did this or why,” Mr. Bloomberg said. Kevin B. Barry, a former supervisor in the New York Police Department bomb squad, said that if the device had functioned, “it would be more of an incendiary event” than an explosion. The license plates on the Nissan were registered to another vehicle — a Ford pickup truck that was taken to a junkyard near Bridgeport, Conn., within the last two weeks, according to a law enforcement official. The previous owner of the Ford was interviewed Saturday night by the F.B.I., but it did not appear he was regarded as a suspect. Still, the junkyard was considered a primary target of the initial investigation. The S.U.V.’s standard vehicle identification number had been removed, Mr. Bloomberg said, and investigators were scouring it to see if the number appeared elsewhere.

0~Thousands Protest in Spain Against Catalonia Talks~MADRID — Tens of thousands of protesters on Sunday called for the ouster of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain and denounced his proposal for talks to try to ease the tensions around the simmering secessionist conflict in Catalonia. The demonstration — held on one of the main squares of Madrid and convened by right-leaning parties under the slogan “For a united Spain, elections now!” — was the largest against Mr. Sánchez since his minority Socialist government took office in June. The government’s proposal last Tuesday to appoint a rapporteur in talks among political parties to address the Catalan independence crisis has galvanized the opposition, which deems it a betrayal and a surrender to pressure from Catalan separatists. The protest Sunday came two days before the start of a landmark trial of 12 Catalan separatist leaders, which is also likely to stir up emotions over a territorial conflict that remains at the top of Spain’s political agenda. The defendants are accused of rebellion and other crimes stemming from their declaration of their region’s independence in the fall of 2017.
0~Hawaii to Visitors: We’ll Pay You to Leave~“The majority of travelers we have sent back in my opinion have been irresponsible in traveling to Hawaii during the Covid-19 pandemic when they know we are trying to keep Hawaii safe from the spread of this disease,” said Jessica Lani Rich, the president and chief executive of VASH. The organization normally provides visitor support, including translation assistance and help with funeral arrangements. Though visitor arrivals are down nearly 99 percent, some residents have reported seeing visitors on beaches despite quarantine restrictions and stay-at-home orders. All beaches in Hawaii are closed, though individuals may cross them either to swim, paddle or surf while observing social distancing. “They either don’t get or are ignoring the message,” Lynne Matusow, a Honolulu resident, wrote in an email to The New York Times. “We have locals, in masks, scolding them for sitting on beaches, with towels, umbrellas, coolers, etc. That is forbidden.” Ms. Rich said some of the visitors VASH has returned home have told her they were taking advantage of low airfares. A round-trip ticket on Southwest Airlines from Oakland, Calif., to Honolulu, for example, was recently priced at $238 for travel in May. On April 22, nearly one month after the governor, David Ige, announced the mandatory 14-day quarantine restriction for incoming arrivals, the Hawaii Tourism Authority said a total of 421 passengers arrived via air, 109 of whom were nonresident visitors. The number of tourists among them is unknown. The tourism authority counts anyone without Hawaii state identification as a visitor, noting that visitors might include an essential health care or disaster assistance worker, or Hawaii natives now residing on the mainland and returning to stay with family.
0~Chinese Hackers Infiltrate New York Times Computers~Michael Higgins, chief security officer at The Times, said: “Attackers no longer go after our firewall. They go after individuals. They send a malicious piece of code to your e-mail account and you’re opening it and letting them in.” Lying in Wait Once hackers get in, it can be hard to get them out. In the case of a 2011 breach at the United States Chamber of Commerce, for instance, the trade group worked closely with the F.B.I. to seal its systems, according to chamber employees. But months later, the chamber discovered that Internet-connected devices — a thermostat in one of its corporate apartments and a printer in its offices — were still communicating with computers in China. In part to prevent that from happening, The Times allowed hackers to spin a digital web for four months to identify every digital back door the hackers used. It then replaced every compromised computer and set up new defenses in hopes of keeping hackers out. “Attackers target companies for a reason — even if you kick them out, they will try to get back in,” said Nick Bennett, the security consultant who has managed Mandiant’s investigation. “We wanted to make sure we had full grasp of the extent of their access so that the next time they try to come in, we can respond quickly.” Based on a forensic analysis going back months, it appears the hackers broke into The Times computers on Sept. 13, when the reporting for the Wen articles was nearing completion. They set up at least three back doors into users’ machines that they used as a digital base camp. From there they snooped around The Times’s systems for at least two weeks before they identified the domain controller that contains user names and hashed, or scrambled, passwords for every Times employee. While hashes make hackers’ break-ins more difficult, hashed passwords can easily be cracked using so-called rainbow tables — readily available databases of hash values for nearly every alphanumeric character combination, up to a certain length. Some hacker Web sites publish as many as 50 billion hash values. Investigators found evidence that the attackers cracked the passwords and used them to gain access to a number of computers. They created custom software that allowed them to search for and grab Mr. Barboza’s and Mr. Yardley’s e-mails and documents from a Times e-mail server.
0~China Tightens Wuhan Lockdown in ‘Wartime’ Battle With Coronavirus~WUHAN, China — The Chinese authorities resorted to increasingly extreme measures in Wuhan on Thursday to try to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus, ordering house-to-house searches, rounding up the sick and warehousing them in enormous quarantine centers. The urgent, seemingly improvised steps come amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Wuhan, one exacerbated by tactics that have left this city of 11 million with a death rate from the coronavirus of 4.1 percent as of Thursday — staggeringly higher than the rest of the country’s rate of 0.17 percent. With the sick being herded into makeshift quarantine camps, with minimal medical care, a growing sense of abandonment and fear has taken hold in Wuhan, fueling the sense that the city and surrounding province of Hubei are being sacrificed for the greater good of China. The harsh new moves in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, clearly signaled the ruling Communist Party’s alarm that it had failed to gain control of the coronavirus epidemic, which has overwhelmed the country’s health care system and threatened to paralyze China, the world’s most populous country and second-largest economy.
0~As New Services Track Habits, the E-Books Are Reading You~SAN FRANCISCO — Before the Internet, books were written — and published — blindly, hopefully. Sometimes they sold, usually they did not, but no one had a clue what readers did when they opened them up. Did they skip or skim? Slow down or speed up when the end was in sight? Linger over the sex scenes? A wave of start-ups is using technology to answer these questions — and help writers give readers more of what they want. The companies get reading data from subscribers who, for a flat monthly fee, buy access to an array of titles, which they can read on a variety of devices. The idea is to do for books what Netflix did for movies and Spotify for music. “Self-published writers are going to eat this up,” said Mark Coker, the chief executive of Smashwords, a large independent publisher. “Many seem to value their books more than their kids. They want anything that might help them reach more readers.” Last week, Smashwords made a deal to put 225,000 books on Scribd, a digital library here that unveiled a reading subscription service in October. Many of Smashwords’ books are already on Oyster, a New York-based subscription start-up that also began in the fall.
0~At Odds Publicly, Donald Trump and Karl Rove Hold a Private Meeting~Mr. Rove also has a long relationship with Sheldon Adelson, another casino magnate who has said he would spend upward of $100 million to back Mr. Trump. Mr. Adelson and Mr. Trump met on Tuesday, their second meeting in the last few weeks. Mr. Rove has talked with Mr. Adelson about what super PAC to use as a vehicle for donating such a large sum of money to support Mr. Trump, including possibly using the Crossroads fund-raising groups, which he helped establish, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Adelson is also discussing the possibility of creating a new entity that would back Mr. Trump, and has been holding talks with Nick Ayers, the former executive director of the Republican Governors Association, according to two people briefed on the discussions. Mr. Ayers’s involvement was first reported by the website Politico. Creating a new group would give Mr. Adelson more control over how his money is spent, at a moment when there are a number of super PACs that either exist or are being formed to support Mr. Trump’s bid. Other major donors, such as Rebekah Mercer, who supported the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, are considering backing Mr. Trump through other super PACs. Super PACs cannot coordinate with campaigns, and, so far, the Trump campaign hasn’t signaled formally whether any group has its tacit blessing. In two cases, former aides to the campaign have gone to work for super PACs that support Mr. Trump, despite “cooling-off periods” mandated by campaign finance laws when transitions like that take place. There is one super PAC supporting Mr. Trump that is run by a former aide to Ben Carson. Another proposed group, which would be backed by Tom Barrack, a financier and close friend of Mr. Trump, was created on Thursday, with more than $30 million in commitments, according to CNN. Another group is being advised by Edward J. Rollins, the strategist who was Ronald Reagan’s campaign manager and has deep ties to the Republican Party.
0~Georgia Recertifies Election Results, Affirming Biden’s Victory~For the Senate runoff races, election officials in Cobb County, the state’s third most populous county, are planning to open fewer than half of the early voting locations that were available in the general election. Voting rights groups said on Monday that the changes would harm Black and Latino voters. Mr. Biden won Cobb County, part of the Atlanta suburbs, by 14 percentage points, improving on Hillary Clinton’s two-point margin in 2016. But the county is planning to open only five early voting locations for the runoffs, down from 11, one of the largest such reductions in the state. Nearly 400,000 people voted in Cobb County in the general election, many through early in-person or mail-in voting. Janine Eveler, the director of elections in Cobb County, said that the county was forced to cut back on polling locations because of severe staffing shortages. “It was not our desire to reduce the number of early voting locations for the runoff, but, unfortunately, it became a necessity,” she said in a statement. But Georgia Democrats see partisan politics at play in a county that is currently controlled by Republicans. They noted that the locations that were closed were in largely Democratic neighborhoods, including places with large Black and Latino populations. Voting rights and civil rights groups pleaded in a letter to Ms. Eveler and other officials to keep all 11 sites open. “Georgia’s Black and Latinx residents are more likely to live in poverty than other residents and will have more difficulty traveling long distances to access advance voting locations, especially because of the limited public transportation options in Cobb County,” the letter said. “As a result, the elimination of advance voting locations will discourage or prevent many of Cobb County’s Black and Latinx voters from participating in the runoff election.” Groups including the N.A.A.C.P. and Fair Fight Action, the voting rights organization led by Ms. Abrams, had offered to help recruit more election workers, but Ms. Eveler said there would not be enough time to train them.
0~U.K. Approves Johnson & Johnson Vaccine~Britain’s drug regulator on Friday approved the use of the single-dose shots manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, the fourth coronavirus vaccine to be authorized in the country. The authorization comes amid growing concerns about the spread in Britain of a coronavirus variant first detected in India. The number of cases of the variant, known as B.1.617.2, has doubled in a week, according to public data, and as of Thursday, nearly 7,000 cases had been detected. “This fourth approved vaccine adds to our armory,” the British health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Twitter. “When you’re eligible, get your jab.” Britain has also authorized the use of the vaccines manufactured by Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech. More than 58 percent of Britain’s population has received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 36 percent has been fully vaccinated. Britain opened vaccination to adults 30 and older this week, but most of the vaccination campaign’s efforts have in recent weeks focused on second injections.
0~China's Push to Empower Street Vendors for 'Stall Economy' Ignites Debate~Xie Yiyi lost her job last Friday, making the 22-year-old Beijing resident one of millions of young people in China left unmoored and shaken by the coronavirus. So that same day, heeding the advice of one of China’s top leaders, she decided to open a barbecue stall. Many people in China would say selling spicy mutton skewers was a step down for an American-educated young person like Ms. Xie — or, really, for anybody in the world’s second-largest economy. Street vendors are seen by many Chinese people as embarrassing eyesores from the country’s past, when it was still emerging from extreme poverty. In many Chinese cities, uniformed neighborhood rules enforcers called chengguan regularly evict and assault sidewalk sellers of fake jewelry, cheap clothes and spicy snacks. But Li Keqiang, China’s premier, had publicly called for the country’s jobless to ignite a “stall economy” to get the country’s derailed economy back on track. In the process, he laid bare China’s diverging narratives after the coronavirus epidemic. Is China an increasingly middle-class country, represented by the skyscrapers and tech campuses in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen? Or is much of it still poor and backward, a country of roadside stalls in back alleys?
0~Covid News: Delta Variant Is Overwhelming Alaska, Site of Worst U.S. Outbreak~Image A coronavirus vaccination clinic at Shorter Community AME Church in Denver in February. Credit... Kevin Mohatt for The New York Times On the heels of federal officials’ endorsement of booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for many fully inoculated Americans, some states announced plans for getting even more shots in arms. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommended on Friday morning vaccines for frontline workers, as well as for people older than 65 and many people with underlying health conditions, overruling an agency advisory panel. Individuals must also have received a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at least six months ago. Tens of millions of Americans woke up eligible for booster shots. In one recent poll, about three-quarters of vaccinated Americans said they would opt for a booster if the doses were available, and some sought them out long before they were authorized. Federal officials recommended self-attestation on Friday as the best method to determine who could get a booster dose. “We’ve worked closely with partners including governors, pharmacies, doctors, long-term care facilities, and other providers, so that eligible Americans are able to get a booster shot at roughly 80,000 places across the country, including over 40,000 local pharmacies,” Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said at a news conference on Friday. More than 70 percent of current vaccine administration was already taking place in pharmacies, according to a C.D.C. presentation at the meeting of agency advisers on Thursday. CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens all said that they would begin administering boosters on Friday. CVS said it will rely on “self-attestation” from customers to determine eligibility. State health departments generally follow the recommendations of the C.D.C., and many on Friday were eager to move ahead. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced that all eligible state residents could immediately get booster shots following federal clearance, which he called “long overdue.” In Indiana, the health department announced that Pfizer boosters were now available to eligible residents. And in Vermont, officials said that residents ages 80 and older could register for boosters, and the state would expand eligibility to those 65 and older over the next week. Many states began organizing their booster rollouts shortly after President Biden announced a plan for Pfizer and Moderna boosters in mid-August, but the plan was followed by criticism that the White House was getting ahead of the regulatory process, and internal disagreement in the Biden administration about the need for boosters. Over the weeks, many independent scientists and regulators had emphasized that there was little research on who might benefit from the extra shots. Eventually the plan to quickly provide Moderna boosters was dropped, to give the F.D.A. more time to collect and study data. And scientific advisers to the F.D.A. and C.D.C. wrestled over the last week with who should get Pfizer boosters and why. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a plan that will help eligible people access boosters, mainly through pharmacies and their primary care providers. Mass vaccination sites in the state could be reopened, according to the plan. Across the country, New York planned to help distribute the shots by making $65 million available to local health departments, who would lead the way on booster distribution, and offering training to more than 50,000 emergency medical technicians to administer the vaccine, Gov. Kathy Hochul said in recent weeks. “We think it’s really important that more people get this just as an extra layer of protection, like putting on an extra winter coat as the weather starts getting colder,” Ms. Hochul said at a news conference on Thursday, adding that boosters will be made available at pharmacies, nursing homes and on-site at different businesses. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said earlier this month that the city would utilize more than 1,900 vaccination sites across the five boroughs and make various outreach efforts. He said eligible New Yorkers could get boosters “as of this exact moment” in an interview Friday morning on “The Brian Lehrer Show” on WNYC. Alison Beam, Pennsylvania’s acting health secretary, signed an order on Tuesday that will require vaccine providers to offer online scheduling for vaccine appointments, live scheduling assistance, walk-in appointments and coordination with local care agencies to help schedule homebound residents. In West Virginia, which faces some of the worst virus conditions of any state, Gov. Jim Justice and public health officials have been calling for federal regulators to sign off on boosters to shore up protection for older, more vulnerable citizens. “Our federal government moves like a turtle, and a lot of times it moves like a turtle in the wrong direction,” he said at a news conference on Friday. Maj. Gen. Jim Hoyer, a retired National Guard officer who leads the interagency task force that coordinates West Virginia’s vaccination efforts, said on Friday that boosters were already “being given as we are on this press conference.” Coral Murphy Marcos contributed reporting.
0~Obama Calls Marathon Bombings an ‘Act of Terrorism’~WASHINGTON — When President Obama went before cameras at the White House on Tuesday, he said he knew nothing more about who carried out the deadly bombings in Boston than he did the day before. But he knew enough to call them an “act of terrorism.” Mr. Obama’s decision to use that designation — which he scrupulously avoided in his first public response on Monday — attests to the lack of reliable information in the chaotic aftermath of the attack and the extreme sensitivity of any president invoking the notion of terrorism. The shift in wording, a senior administration official said, was “entirely driven by the information flow.” As investigators learned more about the nature of the attack, and the explosives used in it, he said, Mr. Obama felt comfortable referring to it as terrorism. “Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror,” the president said in his appearance shortly before midday. Deploring what he called a “heinous and cowardly act,” Mr. Obama said that “the American people refuse to be terrorized.”
0~Is the U.S. Prepared for an Ebola Outbreak?~Mr. Duncan flies from Monrovia to Brussels, then to Washington and finally to Dallas. He clears customs in Washington, where he may have been given a flier on the warning signs of Ebola. American officials believe Mr. Duncan did not have a fever when he arrived in the United States. Customs and Border Protection agents are supposed to contact the C.D.C. if they think someone may be infected. federal Customs and Border Protection agents are supposed to contact the C.D.C. if they think someone may be infected. On the day Mr. Duncan died, federal officials announced that passengers from the three countries most affected by the Ebola outbreak will be tested for fever by Customs and Border Protection staff members on arrival in the United States. Those who have a fever will be evaluated by a C.D.C. official. It will be up to local health departments to decide whether to place them in quarantine. Health experts say the new measures are more likely to calm the public than to prevent Ebola from entering the country. They caution that a temperature check on arrival would almost certainly not have detected the virus in Mr. Duncan.
0~A Very Strange Version of the Paris Night~Calling it a night at 9 p.m. is about the most anti-Parisian occurrence, especially this time of year, when twilight does not arrive until after 10 p.m. and the last thing anyone wants to do as the sun drifts down is go home. The curfew is no joke though. If you somehow forget to eat and do not have much in the fridge at home, you are out of luck. There are no late-night steak frites to be had. All the kitchens, grocers and ice cream parlors are, unnaturally, locked. Listen to Thibaud Pre. He runs an Italian restaurant on the Canal Saint-Martin in the northeast part of the city. It’s where the youngish folks hang out. Think of the northern neighborhoods of Brooklyn, like Williamsburg and Bushwick, or the eastern part of London. On Friday evening, just before 8, the cool kids and the older adults who wanted to be like them were drinking on the edge of the canals and in Acqua e Farina, Pre’s restaurant, and all of the other bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. An hour later, they were mostly gone, scurrying home or rushing to the Metro, where, just after 9 p.m., security officials could begin asking for the pass required to be out and about after curfew.
0~Dinesh D’Souza Is Charged With Using Straw Donors~Dinesh D’Souza, a best-selling conservative author and filmmaker, was indicted on Thursday on charges that he used straw donors to illegally donate to a 2012 Senate campaign. Mr. D’Souza is an outspoken political commentator who directed “2016: Obama’s America,” a scathing anti-Obama documentary released in the final months of the president’s re-election campaign. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said that Mr. D’Souza encouraged others to give $20,000 to a Senate candidate and reimbursed them for the donations. Election law prohibits such arrangements and caps donations at $5,000 per donor to any one candidate. The Senate candidate was not identified in the indictment. Mr. D’Souza donated to only one federal candidate in 2012, giving $5,000 to Wendy Long, a New York Republican who lost her challenge to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat.
0~The Big Ask of Black Voters: Trust the Government~Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies race and electoral politics, said black skepticism in government stretches back decades, citing Booker T. Washington and his late 19th century and early 20th century argument for black self-help, rather than a focus on systemic discrimination. Black voters are often described as “moderates,” but Mr. Johnson said the voting choices are more nuanced than straightforward ideological choices. Racism “contributes to black people’s lack of support for mass federal programs,” Mr. Johnson said. “There’s a sense that, if you prefer federal programs, that can be an admission that you can’t make it without white people or government.” In “Medicare for all,” free college and other signature progressive proposals, like the cancellation of student loan debt or housing equality, candidates are asking black voters to trust that government can correct the same systemic inequalities that government helped create. But there is often no plan to undo the cynicism that decades of governmental failure have created among older black voters in particular. “No matter who is in office, the government has not been our best friend,” said Samuel Crisp, 73. He is part of the Piedmont Progressive Farmers Group, which focuses on egg production, and attended the Warren campaign event in Virginia. “They all have programs that work against us,” he added. “And they don’t seem to understand that.” There is some precedent for selling older black voters on the promise for structural change. In 2004, the populist campaign of Senator John Edwards of North Carolina won the South Carolina Democratic primary contest. The Rev. Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988 succeeded in bringing a message of systemic upheaval to black voters — winning 11 contests in 1988, including in Virginia and South Carolina. In an interview, Mr. Jackson urged the current crop of left-wing candidates like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren to get better at working to relate to and understand black communities. “I earned the trust of the people. I worked with them on the ground. I wasn’t just an election candidate. I served with them,” Mr. Jackson said. “I was at their restaurants. I played football. I stayed in their homes.” Mr. Jackson acknowledged that forming those connections is a different challenge for white candidates, who could risk appearing “pretentious and not genuine,” but he said he believed there were authentic and effective approaches.
0~An Award for Bill Clinton Came With $500,000 for His Foundation~To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Petra Nemcova, a Czech model who survived the disaster by clinging to a palm tree, decided to pull out all the stops for the annual fund-raiser of her school-building charity, the Happy Hearts Fund. She booked Cipriani 42nd Street, which greeted guests with Bellini cocktails on silver trays. She flew in Sheryl Crow with her band and crew for a 20-minute set. She special-ordered heart-shaped floral centerpieces, heart-shaped chocolate parfaits, heart-shaped tiramisù and, because orange is the charity’s color, an orange carpet rather than a red one. She imported a Swiss auctioneer and handed out orange rulers to serve as auction paddles, playfully threatening to use hers to spank the highest bidder for an Ibiza vacation. The gala cost $363,413. But the real splurge? Bill Clinton. The former president of the United States agreed to accept a lifetime achievement award at the June 2014 event after Ms. Nemcova offered a $500,000 contribution to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The donation, made late last year after the foundation sent the charity an invoice, amounted to almost a quarter of the evening’s net proceeds — enough to build 10 preschools in Indonesia. Happy Hearts’ former executive director believes the transaction was a quid pro quo, which rerouted donations intended for a small charity with the concrete mission of rebuilding schools after natural disasters to a large foundation with a broader agenda and a budget 100 times bigger.
0~Facing ‘Putin’s Energy Blackmail,’ Europe Agrees to Cut Russian Gas Use~The European Commission’s original proposal last week presented a less flexible plan to urgently cut use of the fuel across the bloc. It foresaw fewer exceptions, and put the Commission itself in charge of calling an emergency and triggering mandatory natural gas curbs. Controversially, the proposal asked even those countries that are less dependent on Russian gas or have already started ambitious energy-saving plans to equally share the burden of cutting consumption, to help those who are more dependent. Critics saw the proposal as primarily benefiting the bloc’s biggest economy and de facto leader, Germany, which is very dependent on Russian natural gas imports. The German vulnerability turned the tables on an old European script; in previous financial crises, the Germans pointed the finger at weaker countries, especially in the continent’s south, for being irresponsible. Now southern countries, among them Greece, Spain and Italy, were able to take the moral high ground. But the complexities of curbing gas use in Europe go far beyond cliché cleavages between north and south. Ultimately, the modus operandi of resolving the disagreements was entirely different from the old E.U. playbook, normally characterized by fruitless, late-night meetings and public disparagement. Instead, E.U. energy ministers meeting in Brussels on Tuesday morning were out of their talks five hours later, with a compromise that seemed to address individual concerns without diluting the policy goal — to cut gas use and defang Mr. Putin’s energy threats.

Emile Ducke for The New York Times RIGA, Latvia — Russia is massing thousands of troops in its western neighbor Belarus ahead of what could be the opening of a new front aimed at disrupting the flow of Western military aid from Poland, according to defense officials in Latvia and Ukraine. However, the assembled forces, about 10,000 troops, may still be too weak to make a successful new thrust south from Belarus, Latvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said on Friday. “We have to be cautious, but I doubt that Russians are at this moment capable of opening another front line against Ukraine, at least not a successful front,” Mr. Pabriks said in an interview in Riga, the capital of Latvia, which borders both Russia and Belarus. An announcement last week by Belarus that it was forming a new joint military force with Russia stirred alarm in the West that the Kremlin might be preparing a new ground assault with help from Belarusian forces. Russia massed troops in Belarus ahead of its initial attack on Ukraine in February. On Thursday, a Ukrainian general, Oleksiy Gromov, said that the threat of a possible invasion from Belarus was growing. He said that a new attack would likely not drive toward Kyiv — which lies just 60 miles from the border with Belarus — but rather to the west of the capital, nearer to the Polish border. An offensive south from western Belarus into Ukrainian territory near the border with Poland could disrupt the flow of weapons to Ukraine from the United States and its allies, much of which passes through Poland. The military officials in Riga and Kyiv did not say precisely where the Russian troops were gathering, nor why they believed a new offensive could occur closer to Poland than to Kyiv. Russia used the territory of Belarus, its closest military and political ally, as a staging ground for its February invasion and has since launched missiles and drones into Ukraine from there. But President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, Belarus’s veteran strongman leader, has resisted Russia’s pressure to get directly involved in the war. On Friday, Mr. Lukashenko said it would be undesirable for Belarusian military equipment to be used in Ukraine and denied his country’s troops were training for war, adding “no war today. We don’t need it,” the state news agency Belta reported. Mr. Lukashenko made a similar statement in February, just days before Russia invaded Ukraine from his territory. On Friday, Ukraine’s armed forces said in a statement that if the country were attacked again from Belarus, it would “respond as fiercely as we respond to all occupiers.” A new front in the north would inevitably pull Ukrainian forces away from the south and east, where they have launched offensives to take back land Russia captured early in the war. The flurry of military activity in Belarus in recent days, Britain’s defense ministry said on Friday, is “likely an attempt to demonstrate Russian-Belarusian solidarity and to convince Ukraine to divert forces to guard the northern border.” Noting claims by Mr. Lukashenko that 70,000 Belarusians and 15,000 Russians would be involved in their new joint force, Britain’s defense ministry said it was unlikely that Russia had actually deployed significant forces and added that Belarus “maintains minimal capability to undertake complex operations.” Vadym Skibitsky, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, said in an interview that Ukraine also did not see an immediate threat of another attack from Belarus. Several thousand newly mobilized Russian soldiers are deployed in Belarus at training sites, Mr. Skibitsky said, but they are not accompanied by tanks, artillery or fuel trucks and other logistical support they would need to invade and face Ukraine’s battle-hardened troops. “We see these elements now moving into Belarus, but we do not see the movement of equipment,” he said. Brig. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, also played down the likelihood of a new Russian invasion from Belarus. “We don’t currently have any indications of a potential imminent military action on that front,” he told a briefing on Thursday. Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Kyiv, Ukraine.
0~I’m Republican. I Appreciate Assault Weapons. And I Support a Ban.~I also know that I am made less safe by the threat of tactical rifles. I am confident I can eliminate an active shooter who is attacking with a pistol because the attacker would have to be close to me. But the defense my concealed 9-millimeter affords me is largely gone if the attacker is firing from beyond 40 yards, as he could easily do with the AR-15. No firearm is evil. Guns are tools that fulfill the intent of their users, good or bad. But we’ve seen that the rifle of choice for many mass shooters is the AR-15. The Second Amendment is unimpeachable. It guarantees the right of citizens to defend themselves. I accept, however, that it does not guarantee that every civilian can bear any and all arms. For example, the purchase of fully automatic firearms is largely banned already, and I cannot purchase an AT-4 rocket, grenades, a Bradley fighting vehicle or an Abrams tank. I know that no single action can prevent a truly determined person from committing mass murder, and I am aware of other ways to commit mass murder, such as bombings and mass vehicular slaughter. Not being able to control everything, however, should not prevent us from doing something. Therefore, I support the following: Defining what constitutes an assault or tactical firearm and not allowing them for future purchase — just as we already prohibit the purchase of fully automatic firearms. The exact definition of assault weapon will need to be determined. But we should all be able to agree that the civilian version of the very deadly weapon that the Army issued to me should certainly qualify. I would not support any version of a ban that results in confiscating existing legally owned firearms. Ensuring that every firearm purchaser has a background check. We also need to improve the background check system.
0~Violent ‘Yellow Vest’ Protests in Week 13~PARIS — In the 13th straight weekend of “Yellow Vest” demonstrations in France, protesters showed no sign of letting up pressure on the government and did not appear appeased by concessions by President Emmanuel Macron. There were scattered acts of violence as protesters and the police clashed in marches in Paris and southern French cities on Saturday. Scuffles broke out near the Avenue des Champs-Élysées and by the National Assembly in central Paris. Motorcycles and trash cans burned as throngs moved in a wave through Paris, and protesters set fire to a car belonging to an antiterrorism unit in front of the Eiffel Tower. One protester was severely wounded when he tried to pick up a “sting-ball grenade” used by the police to disperse crowds and it exploded in his hand.
0~North Korea Fires 2 Ballistic Missiles as Arms Rivalry Mounts~SEOUL — North Korea launched two ballistic missiles off its east coast on Wednesday, the country’s first ballistic missile test in six months and a violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions that ban North Korea from conducting such tests. Hours after the missiles were launched, South Korea announced that its president, Moon Jae-in, had just attended the test of the country’s first submarine-launched ballistic missile, making South Korea ​the seventh country in the world to operate S.L.B.M.s, after the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and India. ​The missile tests by both Koreas on the same day dramatically highlighted the intensifying arms race on the Korean Peninsula as nuclear disarmament talks between Washington and North Korea remained stalled. They also underscored the growing concern over regional stability, with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan calling the North Korean missile launch “outrageous” and a threat to peace. In its announcement, South Korea revealed that it had successfully developed a supersonic cruise missile and a long-range air-to-land missile to be mounted on the KF-21, a South Korean supersonic fighter jet, and that it had developed a ballistic missile powerful enough to penetrate North Korea’s underground wartime bunkers.
0~New Outcry as Trump Rebukes Charlottesville Racists 2 Days Later~WASHINGTON — The crisis in Charlottesville, Va., presented President Trump with a choice between adopting the unifying tone of a traditional president or doubling down on the go-it-alone approach that got him elected in 2016. On Monday, Mr. Trump offered a glimpse of a more calming and conventional president, but he ended the day with a flurry of angry tweets that left little doubt he intended to govern on his own terms. Mr. Trump, after two days of issuing equivocal statements, bowed to overwhelming pressure that he personally condemn white supremacists who incited bloody weekend demonstrations in Charlottesville. “Racism is evil,” said Mr. Trump, delivering a statement from the White House at a hastily arranged appearance meant to halt the growing political threat posed by the unrest. “And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.”

0~Unilever to Make the Netherlands Its Sole Headquarters, in Blow to Britain~Unilever employs about 7,300 people in Britain and 3,100 in the Netherlands; none are expected to be affected by the structural change. The company also said it would continue to spend 1 billion pounds, or about $1.4 billion, a year in Britain, including on research and development. Despite the company’s insistence that it would keep its presence in the British capital, Rajesh Agrawal, the London deputy mayor for business, said the decision was “clearly disappointing news” for the city. “It brings into sharp focus the need for the government to secure a Brexit deal that secures London as Europe’s leading business center,” Mr. Agrawal added. Unilever’s two headquarters mirrored its legal structure, in which the company maintained separate stock listings and corporate entities in both countries after its formation by the combination of the British soap maker Lever Brothers and the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie in 1930. Each of the two operating companies technically has its own board, but the boards are made up of the same directors and senior management. While unusual, the structure has been used by some of the largest companies with ties to both Britain and the Netherlands. The oil giant Royal Dutch Shell maintained a similar system until 2005, and RELX Group, the business information company that owns LexisNexis Legal and was formerly known as Reed Elsevier, dropped its dual structure this year. As consumers have shied away from traditional brands in favor of products from smaller companies with more natural and organic ingredients, Unilever has tried to keep pace by buying companies like Schmidt’s Naturals, Sundial Brands and Dollar Shave Club in recent years.

0~New York Is Getting $22 Billion in Federal Aid. How Should It Be Spent?~The City of Los Angeles plans to spend $1.3 billion in federal aid over two years, including to pay for more than $600 million worth of pandemic-related losses incurred as Covid-19 drove up the city’s expenses and hammered its economy. A spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti said a portion of the aid also will be directed to offer rental assistance and could be used to support progressive pilot programs, including one that would give low-income residents a $1,000 guaranteed basic income for a year. The huge amount of federal aid could not only shore up enormous expenses incurred during the pandemic but also propel cities and states to better economic positions than they had before the outbreak, Ms. Gordon said. “It’s an opportunity to create a better platform for growth in the future,” she said. In New York the Citizens Budget Commission has identified up to $4 billion in potentially recurring expenses paid by the federal relief — mental health teams, housing vouchers, early childhood education for 3-year-olds and more — that would be unfunded by 2026 when the assistance phases out, Mr. Rein said. Those programs would be likely to enjoy broad support, he said, raising the chances that the city might be forced to cut elsewhere to continue financing them. “As we came together as a group, we said we have this opportunity but the money is sprinkled,” he said, “and we are setting ourselves up for fiscal challenges with recurring programs.” Shawn Hubler contributed reporting from California.
0~Driver Rams Into Officers at Capitol, Killing One and Injuring Another~WASHINGTON — The band of razor wire-topped fencing around the Capitol had recently come down. The heavy National Guard presence had begun to thin. But on Friday, not quite three months after the deadly Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, a car came careening midday onto the Capitol grounds, slamming into two Capitol Police officers and leaving one of them dead and the other injured. This time, the source of the violence was not an angry pro-Trump mob, but a lone driver, armed with a knife, who had recently told friends he had left his job and had “afflictions.” After crashing his car and menacing officers, he was shot and killed. “It is with a very, very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries,” Yogananda D. Pittman, the acting Capitol Police chief, said during a news conference near the scene. “This has been an extremely difficult time for U.S. Capitol Police, after the events of Jan. 6 and now the events that have occurred here today.”
0~In Rebuke to Trump, Supreme Court Allows Release of Jan. 6 Files~WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused a request from former President Donald J. Trump to block the release of White House records concerning the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, effectively rejecting Mr. Trump’s claim of executive privilege and clearing the way for the House committee investigating the riot to start receiving the documents hours later. The court, with only Justice Clarence Thomas noting a dissent, let stand an appeals court ruling that Mr. Trump’s desire to maintain the confidentiality of internal White House communications was outweighed by the need for a full accounting of the attack and the disruption of the certification of the 2020 electoral count. In an unsigned order, the majority wrote that Mr. Trump’s request for a stay while the case moved forward presented weighty issues, including “whether and in what circumstances a former president may obtain a court order preventing disclosure of privileged records from his tenure in office, in the face of a determination by the incumbent president to waive the privilege.” But an appeals court’s ruling against Mr. Trump did not turn on those questions, the order said. “Because the court of appeals concluded that President Trump’s claims would have failed even if he were the incumbent, his status as a former president necessarily made no difference to the court’s decision,” the order said.
0~Suspect Tries to Compare Capitol Riot to Last Year’s Violence in Portland, Ore.~The comparison has become a staple among right-wing figures in the news media and Republican politicians: The attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 was really no different than the unrest last year that accompanied months of racial justice protests. Any discussion of the first should — out of fairness, they have said — make reference to the second. Now, for the first time, a federal court is poised to consider the merits of that argument, albeit in a narrow legal context. The move comes in the case of Garret Miller, a Dallas man charged with storming the Capitol and facing off with officers inside. Last month, Mr. Miller, 34, raised what is known as a selective prosecution defense, claiming that he had been charged with violent crimes because of his conservative beliefs while dozens of leftist activists in Portland, Ore., had similar charges stemming from last year’s violence reduced or dismissed. “Mr. Miller has been treated differently by the government than the Portland rioters based upon the politics involved,” his lawyer wrote.
0~IPhone Sales Drop, and Apple’s 13-Year Surge Ebbs~SAN FRANCISCO — From the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad, Apple created more than a decade’s worth of new gadgets to fuel its historic growth. But the technology company’s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday — a casualty of Apple’s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers. Apple, the Silicon Valley giant that has spent much of the last five years as the world’s most valuable company, said on Tuesday that revenue for its second fiscal quarter, which ended in March, declined 13 percent to $50.6 billion as sales of its flagship product, the iPhone, fell, with little else to take its place. Nearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries. Rival smartphone makers using Google’s Android operating system continue to challenge the company with powerful, less expensive devices.
0~What is Court Packing? Supreme Court Vacancy Revives Idea From FDR~“I will ask them to, over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system, because it’s getting out of whack,” Mr. Biden said in the interview, which is expected to air on “60 Minutes” on Sunday. Expanding the court is an idea commonly associated with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who pushed legislation in 1937 that could have broadened the Supreme Court from nine to as many as 15 justices. The history is more complicated than the usual narrative suggests: Mr. Roosevelt, aiming to push older justices to step down, wanted to add a justice to the court for each sitting justice who refused to retire after 70. Today, Democrats characterize court expansion as a defensive move against Republican actions, not a unilateral power grab. In 2016, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, refused to hold a vote on Merrick Garland, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Mr. McConnell held the seat open until after the inauguration of Mr. Trump, who nominated Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. Many Democrats now say that Justice Gorsuch occupies a seat “stolen” by Republicans, which has shifted the ideological core of the court. Since Justice Ginsburg’s death, the outrage has intensified as Senate Republicans have committed to doing what they said was inappropriate in 2016: confirming a justice in an election year. “Let me be clear: If Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans move forward with this, then nothing is off the table for next year. Nothing is off the table,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told his caucus on a phone call after Justice Ginsburg’s death.
0~Omar Mateen: From Early Promise to F.B.I. Surveillance~FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Omar Mateen’s life seemed to be on a successful trajectory a decade before he carried out one of the worst cases of mass murder in American history. He earned an associate degree in criminal justice technology in 2006. A year later, he was hired by one of the world’s premier private security companies, G4S. And then, in 2009, he got married and bought a home. Soon, though, signs of troubles emerged. His wife, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, divorced him in 2011, after he abused her. Two years after that, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was called in after reports from Mr. Mateen’s co-workers that he, the American-born son of Afghan immigrants, had suggested he may have had terrorist ties. The F.B.I. interviewed him twice, but after surveillance, records checks and witness interviews, agents were unable to verify any terrorist links and closed their investigation.
0~Saudis Said to Use Coercion and Abuse to Seize Billions~The crown prince is seeking to recover that money, which he believes was taken illegally from a charity, according to people familiar with the negotiations. King Abdullah’s children, however, consider it their inheritance. The foundation’s administrator is Prince Turki, whose aide, General Qahtani, died in custody. Prince Turki is still detained and most of his siblings and their families are banned from traveling outside the kingdom. Others are abroad in London and elsewhere, afraid to return to the kingdom that their father recently ruled. According to one relative and two associates of the Abdullah family, his children are allowed to withdraw $26,000 per week each from their accounts to cover their expenses. The government said in January that 56 people are still being held because of “pending criminal cases” and will be put on trial. Anyone who preferred to challenge the corruption accusations in court had the right to do so, the government says. Those who have been released say they are not really free. They have kept low profiles, unsure when the government will take the assets they signed away in the Ritz. Most are barred from travel and cannot obtain access to their financial accounts. Some detainees believe the ankle bracelets they are wearing that track their movements also transmit their conversations. Some cover the trackers with pillows or play loud music to deter potential eavesdroppers, people who have visited them say. “They want to pressure you and your kids so that you will sell your assets to be allowed to travel again,” one relative of a released detainee said. “It is the same inside and outside of the Ritz.”
0~T-Mobile to Make It Cheaper to Make Calls While Abroad~Cellphone plans are a little like languages: they don’t always translate well in foreign countries. Often, travelers have to pay an extra $100 to their provider to get any cell service abroad. Or they must sign up for a short-term plan with a carrier in the country they are visiting. T-Mobile US, one of the largest phone carriers in the United States, wants to change that. The company on Wednesday said it was eliminating the charges that a customer normally paid to use their phone number and data service in a foreign country, called roaming fees. John Legere, T-Mobile’s chief executive, said in an interview that travelers had long been shocked by exorbitant cellphone bills after they traveled, so many people now just leave their phones off. He said the point of the change was to help the people who would pay $100 for service abroad. But it was also to help “the people who fear turning their phone on.”
0~House Passes Bill Giving More Power to the F.D.A.~Just Tuesday, cancer patients marched outside F.D.A. offices to protest the agency’s decision not to approve Provenge, a drug for prostate cancer. The legislation passed Wednesday does nothing to address calls by some patient advocacy groups for the agency to allow the sale of some drugs while they are still being researched. Nor does the bill do much about concern over the safety of imported foods beyond creating a registry of adulterated foods and a statement that Congress “should work to develop a comprehensive response to the issue of food safety.” Followers of the drug agency’s activities said the bill was so complicated that it would take time to sort through it. “It’s a Christmas tree with more moving parts than you can imagine,” said Peter Barton Hutt, a former F.D.A. general counsel. The House vote, 405 to 7 for approval, came after an all-night negotiating session over a few sticking points, and it came almost exactly three years after the withdrawal from the market of Vioxx, a pain pill that was found to increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The Vioxx withdrawal kicked off an intense period of scrutiny for the drug agency that resulted in development of many of the bill’s most important provisions. One of those is a projected increase to $400 million — up about 25 percent — that drug makers must pay to finance agency operations. Fees for makers of medical devices will also increase. The bill would expand the scope of what the agency can do with that money. Drug makers would be required to post publicly the results of all clinical trials involving approved medicines. This provision is in response to controversy about a set of clinical trials kept secret by the industry that revealed that antidepressants increased the risks of suicide in teenagers while doing little to treat their depression.
0~Trump Takes Center Stage in Dispute Over Jamal Khashoggi~But Mr. Trump also deflected questions about the kingdom’s human rights record. Asked if it had been overlooked for too long, the president directed attention to other countries. “I think a lot of records are overlooked,” he said. “If you look at Iran, if you look at some of the other countries, if you take a look at Syria, if you take a look at a lot of countries, a lot of countries’ records have been overlooked. But this is a very serious thing and we’re looking at it in a very serious manner.” Turkish officials have dribbled out a series of lurid leaks describing an assassination scheme so complex that it could have been directed only from a senior level of the Saudi royal court: a team of 15 agents, including a top Saudi doctor of forensics, flying into Turkey on two private planes the day of Mr. Khashoggi’s appointment at the consulate expressly to kill him and dispose of the mess. In statements, however, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stopped short of directly accusing the Saudis. Turkish officials have said their president has held his fire in part because he hopes that Washington will help push Saudi Arabia to acknowledge what happened to Mr. Khashoggi. But such faith in Washington is hard for almost any Turkish politician to espouse publicly these days because of a tide of anti-Americanism that has swept the country since Mr. Trump raised tariffs on several categories of Turkish imports, punishing the country’s struggling economy. “Intervention by Trump is the highest form of mockery,” Resul Tosun, a columnist for the pro-government Star newspaper wrote on Friday, arguing that any American help with the investigation would “portray Turkey as a banana republic.”

0~Assassination in Iran Threatens Fate of Nuclear Deal~WASHINGTON — The assassination of the scientist who led Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon for the past two decades threatens to cripple President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s effort to revive the Iran nuclear deal before he can even begin his diplomacy with Tehran. And that may well have been a main goal of the operation. Intelligence officials say there is little doubt that Israel was behind the killing — it had all the hallmarks of a precisely timed operation by Mossad, the country’s spy agency. And the Israelis have done nothing to dispel that view. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long identified Iran as an existential threat, and named the assassinated scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, as national enemy No. 1, capable of building a weapon that could threaten a country of eight million in a single blast. But Mr. Netanyahu also has a second agenda. “There must be no return to the previous nuclear agreement,” he declared shortly after it became clear that Mr. Biden — who has proposed exactly that — would be the next president. Mr. Netanyahu believes a covert bomb program is continuing, until yesterday under Mr. Fakhrizadeh’s leadership, and would be unconstrained after 2030, when the nuclear accord’s restraints on Tehran’s ability to produce as much nuclear fuel as it wants expires. To critics of the deal, that is its fatal flaw.
0~China’s Communist Leader Acts to Bolster Military~GUANGZHOU, China — Xi Jinping, the new Communist Party chief and civilian commander of the Chinese military, is moving quickly to make strengthening the country’s armed forces a centerpiece of what he calls the “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation. The nationalist message of building up the People’s Liberation Army has been broadcast loudly in the aftermath of Mr. Xi’s recent visit to south China. The trip, which began Dec. 7, was Mr. Xi’s first outside Beijing as party chief and is now being examined for his policy priorities. This week, the state news media gave prominent coverage to Mr. Xi’s visit with troops of the Guangzhou military region, including a trip aboard the Haikou, a destroyer that belongs to the fleet patrolling disputed waters in the South China Sea. “We must insist on using battle-ready standards in undertaking combat preparations, constantly enhancing officers’ and troops’ thinking about serving in battle, and leading troops into battle and training troops for battle,” Mr. Xi said, according to a report on Wednesday by Xinhua, the state news agency, that was later published by prominent state-run newspapers. “And we must insist on rigorous military training based on the needs of actual combat.” Speaking to soldiers in the city of Huizhou, Mr. Xi emphasized the military aspects of his Chinese dream: “This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation; and for the military, it is the dream of a strong military. We must achieve the great revival of the Chinese nation, and we must ensure there is unison between a prosperous country and a strong military.”
0~A Strained Alliance: Obama-Netanyahu Rift Grew Over Years~WASHINGTON — For six years, the pattern has been the same. A dispute between American and Israeli leaders spills out into the open. Analysts declare the relationship in crisis. Then the two sides try to tamp down emotions and argue that the rupture is not as dire as it looks. In the latest falling-out between President Obama and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first part of the pattern has certainly held — but not the second. This time, senior officials in both Washington and Jerusalem are making little effort to paper over the seriousness of the rift and even less, it seems, to try to repair it. The diplomatic break touched off by Mr. Netanyahu’s decision to negotiate an address to Congress without first telling Mr. Obama is about much more than a speech. It reflects fundamentally different world views between the leaders of two longtime allies: an American president eager for a historic rapprochement with Iran and an Israeli premier nursing an existential fear of a nuclear-armed enemy. It reflects six years of suspicion and mistrust and grievance, wounds from past brawls easily reopened by what might otherwise be small irritations. It reflects resentment on the part of Mr. Obama, who watched Mr. Netanyahu seemingly root for his Republican opponent in the 2012 election and now sees him circumventing the Oval Office to work with a Republican Congress instead. And it reflects a conviction on the part of Mr. Netanyahu that Mr. Obama may sell out Israel with a bad deal and may be trying to influence the coming Israeli elections.
0~Elizabeth Warren to Forgo Receptions and Fund-Raisers With Big Donors~Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday escalated her presidential campaign’s battle against big money in politics, announcing that her bid for the Democratic nomination will forgo traditional fund-raising methods meant to cultivate a candidate’s relationships with the wealthy. The Massachusetts senator said she would no longer hold the private fund-raisers and one-on-one meetings with big donors that have become typical for Democrats and Republicans. “That means no fancy receptions or big money fund-raisers only with people who can write the big checks,” Ms. Warren said in a morning email to supporters. “It means that wealthy donors won’t be able to purchase better seats or one-on-one time with me at our events. And it means I won’t be doing ‘call time,’ which is when candidates take hours to call wealthy donors to ask for their support.” Ms. Warren made the announcement as the Democratic primary to oppose President Trump’s re-election bid begins to take shape, and candidates in the crowded field are trying to find ways to distinguish themselves. Ms. Warren, who rose to prominence as a harsh critic of big corporations and unrestrained capitalism, has attempted to push the field in that direction, announcing expansive, liberal ideas on money and wealth more than a year before the first votes are cast.
0~Obama Offers New Standards on Police Gear in Wake of Ferguson Protests~WASHINGTON — President Obama, grappling with how to respond to the racial unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and a wave of anger at law enforcement officials across the country, said Monday that he would tighten standards on the provision of military-style equipment to local police departments and provide funds for police officers to wear cameras. But Mr. Obama stopped short of curtailing the transfer of military-grade gear to local law enforcement authorities and continued to put off a visit to Ferguson. Instead, the White House tried to channel the rage over the fatal police shooting of a black teenager there into a national debate about how to restore trust between the police and the public. Administration officials said they concluded after a review that the vast majority of transfers of military-style equipment strengthened local policing, even after the police in Ferguson were criticized for heavy-handed use of such gear to quell protests last summer. But the officials said local authorities needed common standards in the types of hardware they requested and better training in how to use it. All told, the changes were modest, and Mr. Obama himself was circumspect in remarks about Ferguson after an orchestrated day of meetings at the White House with civil rights and religious leaders, big-city mayors, and law enforcement officials. The president seemed eager to keep the focus not on what happened in Ferguson but on its broader lessons for the country.
0~China’s Cultural Revolution, Explained~Fifty years ago, Mao Zedong unleashed the Cultural Revolution, a decade-long upheaval that had dramatic, often violent effects across China. Here is an overview of those tumultuous years: What was the Cultural Revolution? The movement was fundamentally about elite politics, as Mao tried to reassert control by setting radical youths against the Communist Party hierarchy. But it had widespread consequences at all levels of society. Young people battled Mao’s perceived enemies, and one another, as Red Guards, before being sent to the countryside in the later stages of the Cultural Revolution. Intellectuals, people deemed “class enemies” and those with ties to the West or the former Nationalist government were persecuted. Many officials were purged. Some, like the future leader Deng Xiaoping, were eventually rehabilitated. Others were killed, committed suicide or were left permanently scarred. Some scholars contend that the trauma of the era contributed to economic transition in the decades that followed, as Chinese were willing to embrace market-oriented reforms to spur growth and ease deprivation. When did it take place? On May 16, 1966, the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee issued a circular that outlined Mao’s ideas on the Cultural Revolution. But there were precursors in the months and years before that. The end is considered to be Mao’s death on Sept. 9, 1976, and the subsequent arrest of the Gang of Four, a radical faction of four political leaders including Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, in October. Although the Cultural Revolution lasted a decade, much of the most extreme violence occurred in the first few years. How did it begin? The Cultural Revolution had roots in the 1958-61 Great Leap Forward, the collectivization of agricultural and industrial output that precipitated a famine that left as many as 45 million dead. Mao was blamed and partly sidelined by Communist Party leaders who pulled back some of the most extreme collectivization efforts.
0~Bahrain is the second country to approve a Chinese vaccine, and other news around the world.~Bahrain said on Sunday that it had approved the use of a Chinese vaccine against the coronavirus, after the United Arab Emirates became the first government to do so on Wednesday. Bahrain said that the vaccine, manufactured by Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned drug maker, was 86 percent effective based on testing of more than 42,000 volunteers, the same preliminary results that the Emirates cited. Bahrain’s statement provided few additional details of the approval process. Sinopharm had no immediate reaction to the decision. Experts had described the reported efficacy of the Sinopharm vaccine as a respectable result that would help China’s efforts to play a key role in the global coronavirus inoculation drive, but they noted the lack of detail in the initial announcements. It also falls short of the results reported by the American drug makers Pfizer and Moderna, which said that their coronavirus vaccines were more than 90 percent effective. Last month, Bahrain said it had begun providing the Sinopharm vaccine to frontline medical workers under an emergency-use authorization. The decision announced on Sunday will allow the vaccine to be administered to the wider public. Bahrain was involved in the testing of the Chinese vaccine, with more than 7,700 people in the island kingdom volunteering for Phase 3 clinical trials.
0~House Votes to Curb N.S.A. Scrutiny of Americans’ Communications~WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives late on Thursday voted to bar the National Security Agency from looking for Americans’ communications without a warrant within a database of emails and phone calls it gathers while targeting foreigners, a technique critics have labeled a “backdoor search loophole.” By a 293-to-123 vote, the House approved the ban as an amendment to the 2015 defense appropriations act. A version of the proposal had been a component in the original version of the USA Freedom Act, legislation the House passed last month that was aimed at curbing N.S.A. spying, but it had been stripped out in negotiations among congressional leaders. The proposal has drawn opposition from security agencies and still has a long way to go before it would become law. But the chief sponsors of the provision — Representatives Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, and Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky — celebrated the lopsided vote. “There’s no question Americans have become increasingly alarmed with the breadth of unwarranted government surveillance programs used to store and search their private data,” they said in a joint statement. “By adopting this amendment, Congress can take a sure step toward shutting the back door on mass surveillance.”
0~Consultant to Politicians in Brazil Faces Arrest~Warrants were also issued for the arrest of Mr. Skornicki and an Odebrecht executive. The new developments come at a delicate time for Ms. Rousseff, whose popularity has declined sharply since her last election. While she has strongly denied having any knowledge or involvement in the scheme, she has been hit hard by the fallout. She has also come under sharp criticism as the country’s once-booming economy veered into a nasty downturn. Yet in recent months, she had won a bit of a respite. Calls for her impeachment and the widespread protests accompanying them have faded somewhat, and the frightening spread of the Zika virus has given her a new opportunity to display leadership. Part of the shift had to do with the growing public rancor toward Eduardo Cunha, the leader of Brazil’s lower house, who had spearheaded impeachment hearings against the president even though he faces serious corruption allegations himself. But Monday’s developments signal that the Petrobras investigation may be getting closer to Ms. Roussef and Mr. da Silva. As of Monday afternoon, Mr. Santana and Ms. Moura had not been apprehended. They were reported to be in the Dominican Republic, where they were working on the re-election campaign of President Danilo Medina.
0~Nigerian Army Facing Questions as Death Toll Soars After Prison Attack~DAKAR, Senegal — Well over 500 people were killed in Nigeria last week when security forces responded to what the military portrayed as a jailbreak attempt by the Islamist group Boko Haram, making it one of the bloodiest episodes yet in the military’s five-year counterinsurgency campaign, according to officials in the northern town of Maiduguri. As inmates streamed last Friday through the opened gates of Giwa Barracks, a notorious military detention center in Maiduguri, a military plane fired on them while soldiers on the ground also opened fire, killing scores, a senior hospital official in Maiduguri said. “The aircraft opened fire from the sky,” he said. “The aircraft picked them easily from up top.” Other officials in Maiduguri corroborated his account and went further, asserting that the overwhelming majority of those killed were detainees imprisoned on flimsy or no charges — and not proven insurgents, as claimed by the military. The episode was reported last week but far lower death tolls were given in most accounts, with the Nigerian military announcing only that there was “heavy human casualty on the terrorists” who it said had attacked the prison.
0~Ruling Threatens Hong Kong’s Independence From China~HONG KONG — Nearly three years after sweeping pro-democracy protests filled the streets of Hong Kong, a local court delivered the struggling movement a severe blow on Friday, removing four legislators from office and assuring China greater influence over the city’s government. The pro-democracy lawmakers were dismissed from the Hong Kong Legislative Council because they had used unacceptable words or even dubious tones in taking oaths of office that require declarations of loyalty to China. The ruling means that democracy advocates in the semiautonomous city’s legislature will no longer have enough votes to block legislation from their pro-Beijing counterparts. “Voters entrusted us with the task of monitoring the government,” said Leung Kwok-hung, one of those unseated. “We’ve lost that power.” Hong Kong has been rattled by episodes that have raised fears that China is reaching deeper into the city to enforce its will. A bookseller who sold lurid titles about China’s leaders was abducted and taken to mainland China. Xiao Jianhua, a prominent billionaire who grew up in China, was snatched from a high-end hotel and brought to the mainland.
0~On Monkeypox, Health Secretary Says States ‘Need to Work With Us’~James Krellenstein, a founder of PrEP4All, an AIDS advocacy group, said that was not fast enough. He faulted the F.D.A. for not moving more quickly to scale up supply and for delaying an inspection of the vaccine maker’s manufacturing plant in Denmark. But Dr. Robert Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner, told reporters Thursday that his agency had moved “much faster than had been planned,” considering that it had to not only inspect the plant but also make sure the vaccine was effective. “The only thing worse than not having a vaccine,” he said, “is having a vaccine which is widely distributed and is not effective.” At the moment, there is not enough vaccine to go around. On Wednesday, Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, a Democrat, wrote a letter to Mr. Becerra and Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, complaining that New Jersey had not gotten its fair share. In the letter, obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Murphy noted New Jersey’s proximity to New York, which has more monkeypox cases than any other state. He said that his calculations showed that because of that proximity and the number of same-sex households in New Jersey, his state would carry 3 percent of the national disease burden, but had been allocated only 2.06 percent of the 131,000 doses that have been available thus far. “Therefore, we do not believe that New Jersey has received an equitable percentage of available vaccine,” Mr. Murphy’s letter said. Federal health officials say their allocation strategy depends on two factors: how many cases a state has and how many of its residents are at risk. The formula favors areas with at-risk populations — including men who have sex with men, who have H.I.V. or who are eligible for medication that can reduce a person’s chances of getting infected with H.I.V., said Dr. Jennifer McQuiston, who is helping to lead the monkeypox response for the C.D.C. Coming after more than two years of the coronavirus pandemic, the monkeypox outbreak, which began in May, has been yet another challenge for beleaguered public health officials around the country. Congress has so far not allocated any money for the response — although Senate Democrats did propose $21 billion in Covid spending on Thursday — and the public is tired of hearing about infectious disease. The Biden administration has estimated it will need another $7 billion to combat monkeypox. And because of the country’s federalist system, in which public health is left to the states, coordinating a national response has not been easy, said Adriane Casalotti, the chief of public and government affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
0~11 Books By Latinos to Read for Hispanic Heritage Month~National Hispanic Heritage Month, a celebration that runs from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, captures a period covering seven different independence days across Latin America. In recent years, however, the celebration has prompted Latinos in the United States to look inward, grappling with issues of representation, colorism and sexuality. To better understand these perspectives, here are 11 recent books that provide a glimpse into distinct corners of contemporary Latino life in the United States: ‘Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,’ by Ed Morales (Verso, 2019) The recent debate over the term “Latinx,” which has grabbed the attention of countless op-ed pages and Twitter threads, is just the latest iteration of a long reckoning over this single, shared identity. So argues Morales, a lecturer at Columbia and CUNY, whose book of politics and social history explains how our current understanding of the Latino identity is rooted in the Latin American concept of mestizaje, or “hybridity,” and how that troubled history is shaping American politics today. Read our review ‘The Undocumented Americans,’ by Karla Cornejo Villavicencio (One World, 2020) This collection falls somewhere between reportage, fiction and memoir in its storytelling, rendering an intimate portrait of the undocumented condition in the United States. Villavicencio chronicles the lives of ground zero cleanup workers, a Haitian priestess in Miami and a former housekeeper battling breast cancer in Flint, Mich., richly describing a population that, as Caitlin Dickerson notes in her review, remains “largely absent from modern journalism and literature.” Read our review | Read our interview with Cornejo Villavicencio ‘The Poet X,’ by Elizabeth Acevedo (Quill Tree, 2018) In this National Book Award-winning verse novel, 15-year-old Xiomara Batista’s life in Harlem has changed seemingly overnight: Her body, now larger and curvier, is newly subject to catcalls and insults; her Dominican mother has become a stern disciplinarian; and her church no longer feels like the haven it once was. As Xiomara contends with these changes, she turns to slam poetry, where she finds freedom and discovers a distinctive voice. Read our interview with Acevedo Lovato unearths the family secrets his father kept guarded to tell a story of trauma and violence from El Salvador to San Francisco’s Mission District. As he reckons with this multigenerational history, Lovato blends this memoir with exhaustive reporting that sheds light on a cycle of bloodshed that spans El Salvador’s civil war, the birth of MS-13 in California and the exportation of gangs to Central America.

0~António Guterres Wants Gender Parity at the U.N. It May Take Time.~[In Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.] The secretary general of the United Nations doesn’t just call himself a feminist. Since becoming the world’s top diplomat in 2017, António Guterres has worn that title like a badge. He does not shy away from terms more commonly found in feminist parlance — “mansplaining,” “patriarchy” and “male-dominated world,” among them. And in a recent speech, he did not put too fine a point on his views about gender inequality. “Stupid,” he branded it, and an obstacle to peace and security. Still, despite broad calls for the U.N. to be overseen by a woman when Mr. Guterres was seeking the job (at the time of his election, more than half the 13 candidates were women), in the end member states went with him. And so whatever his views, Mr. Guterres remains both symbol and product of a male-dominated organization. His focus on gender, however, is a “radical step forward from what we’ve seen in the past,” said Lyric Thompson, the director of policy and advocacy at the International Center for Research on Women, a Washington-based advocacy group that has closely tracked the secretary general’s tenure and suggests improvements.
0~Amid Rain of Shells, Aleppo’s Civilians Offer ‘Final Scream’~BEIRUT, Lebanon — Families, medical workers, insurgent fighters and wounded people were packed and ready Wednesday morning to vacate the ravaged rebel-held neighborhoods of the Syrian city of Aleppo under a deal between Russia and Turkey. Then the resumed booms of incoming artillery shells from pro-government forces sent them into hiding or running for their lives. It was the latest life-or-death whiplash for the thousands trapped in the ruins of a once-vibrant northern metropolis, which has come to symbolize the atrocities unfolding in the nearly six-year-old war. Under the supposed deal for a cease-fire and evacuation — announced on Tuesday by Turkey, Russia and Syrian rebels — the remaining fighters were to leave Aleppo for rebel-held territory farther north and civilians were free to join them or move to government-held areas.
0~Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s First Female Leader, Is Assailed in China for Being ‘Emotional’~BEIJING — An article by a Chinese military official suggesting that Taiwan’s new president was “extreme” and “emotional” because she was unmarried provoked an outcry on Wednesday, undermining the ruling Communist Party’s efforts to win allies across the Taiwan Strait. The article, written by a senior scholar for the People’s Liberation Army, described Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s first female leader, as a “single woman politician” who was prone to a radical style because she lacked the “burden of love, family and children.” It also questioned her loyalty to China because of her family’s ties to Japan. The article, written by Maj. Gen. Wang Weixing of the Academy of Military Sciences in Beijing and posted on Tuesday on the website of the International Herald Leader, a newspaper affiliated with the state news agency Xinhua, was roundly denounced as sexist and promptly removed from major mainland news sites. “It is discrimination against women and being single,” Sun Xingjie, a lecturer at Jilin University in northeast China, wrote in a commentary published by Sina, a news portal. “Putin divorced during his presidency. Has Russia’s strategy changed since?”
0~Obama Acknowledges U.S. Erred in Assessing ISIS~"WASHINGTON — President Obama acknowledged in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the United States had underestimated the rise of the Islamic State militant group, which has seized control of a broad swath of territory in the Middle East, and had placed too much trust in the Iraqi military, allowing the region to become “ground zero for jihadists around the world.” Reflecting on how a president who wanted to disentangle the United States from wars in the Middle East ended up redeploying to Iraq and last week expanding air operations into Syria, Mr. Obama pointed to assessments by the intelligence agencies that said they were surprised by the rapid advances made in both countries by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. “Our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that, I think, they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria,” Mr. Obama said on “60 Minutes,” the CBS News program, referring to James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence. Mr. Obama added that the agencies had overestimated the ability and will of the Iraqi Army to fight such Sunni extremists. “That’s true. That’s absolutely true,” he said. In citing Mr. Clapper, Mr. Obama made no mention of any misjudgment he may have made himself. Critics have repeatedly pointed to his comment last winter characterizing groups like the Islamic State as a ""JV team"" compared with the original Al Qaeda."
0~Boston Is Eager to Begin Marathon Bombing Trial, and to End It~Todd Koen, 42, of Beverly, Mass., a firefighter at the scene after the bombs went off, is just as infuriated at Mr. Tsarnaev but thinks he should be sent to prison for the rest of his life. “If he gets the death penalty he gets off easy,” Mr. Koen said. “He doesn’t have to deal with it or live with it.” Ms. Clarke, who is preparing a defense that casts her client as having been manipulated by his older brother, Tamerlan, has made overtures to prosecutors about a plea bargain, according to a lawyer close to the case. But so far she has been rebuffed, and her frustration showed in court papers that she filed Dec. 29 seeking to delay the trial. “If the government remains unwilling to relent in seeking death, and the case therefore must be tried, the defense is asking for nothing more than a trial that is fair,” she wrote. It will not be fair, she said, unless she has more time to prepare. In a flurry of last-minute pleadings, Ms. Clarke, who declined to be interviewed, also sought to have the trial moved out of Boston. But for now, it is scheduled to start here on Monday. Federal death penalty trials are rare. This would be the biggest since that of Zacarias Moussaoui, a Sept. 11 conspirator, in 2006, and the trial of Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, in 1997. That such a trial would take place here is the source of some angst. Massachusetts has no death penalty and sentiment in this city is strongly against it; a Boston Globe poll in September 2013 found 57 percent of Bostonians favored life without parole for Mr. Tsarnaev, while 33 percent favored death. Still there has been little outcry at Mr. Holder’s decision to authorize the death penalty. In July, a Globe poll of voters statewide found 62 percent supported it, while 29 percent were opposed. The state’s top politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Gov. Deval Patrick, who is leaving office, and the Boston mayor, Martin J. Walsh, all Democrats, oppose the death penalty but none spoke out against the decision. Mr. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts stemming from the explosion of two bombs on April 15, 2013, near the finish line. On April 19, after a night of mayhem that included the killing of an M.I.T. police officer and a frenzied manhunt, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, lay dead, having been shot by the police and run over by Dzhokhar, who was escaping in a stolen sport utility vehicle; Dzhokhar was later captured in a boat in a suburban driveway.
0~Who Will Be Running Consumer Agency on Monday? It’s Unclear~Now, both sides say the law is in their favor, setting up a clash that may well end up in court. President Trump and his administration are working to roll back regulations on businesses. The consumer bureau has been a prominent holdout. When Congress created it six years ago, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it gave the agency broad powers over a wide variety of financial products, including mortgages, credit cards, bank accounts and student loans. The consumer bureau is still carrying out the agenda it developed under President Barack Obama, issuing new rules — like a recent regulation intended to curtail sharply the payday lending market — and sanctioning financial companies for practices that it considers unfair or abusive. Nearly 30 million consumers have collected almost $12 billion in refunds and canceled debts because of the agency’s actions. But the bureau has long been vilified by Republicans as an overreaching, aggressive arm of government. Now, with President Trump’s support, they have intensified their efforts to curb its power. In a significant blow to the agency, Congress recently overturned a rule that would have allowed millions of Americans to band together in class-action lawsuits against financial institutions. Installing Mr. Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk who previously called the agency a “sick, sad” joke, as the agency’s interim leader would immediately alter the consumer bureau’s focus.
0~Mapping the Clashes Between Baltimore Police and Protesters~In the Sandtown-Winchester area where Mr. Gray was chased by police officers, life expectancy is 69.7 years, on par with Iraq and Kazakhstan. In many of the neighborhoods where violence has flared, life expectancies, incomes and other quality-of-life measures are far below the American average. Some of the areas with the lowest life expectancy, like Seton Hill, where Lexington Market was looted on Monday, also have the highest poverty rates and are home to a large percentage of African-Americans.
0~Venice Flooding Brings City to ‘Its Knees’~ROME — The mayor of Venice, who said that the city “was on its knees,” has called for a state of emergency and the closing of all schools after the Italian city was submerged under “acqua alta,” an exceptionally high tide — the highest in 50 years. Outdoor restaurant tables and chairs could be seen bobbing in the waters, and tourists were forced to clamber through the windows of high-end hotels as the water rose to about six feet before 11 p.m. on Tuesday. As dawn broke on Wednesday, the authorities began to survey the damage. “I’ve seen things in San Marco I thought I’d never see,” Mayor Luigi Brugnaro of Venice told the Italian station Radio24. “It is a very difficult situation,” he added. In a post on Twitter, the mayor blamed climate change for the city’s troubles and called for the rapid completion of a long-delayed barrier system.
0~In Indian Candidate, Hindu Right Sees a Reawakening~Asked last month about the R.S.S.’s muscular assistance, Arun Jaitley, a top official in Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, dismissed the notion that the group would have a place in a postelection government. “People who do have a lot of ideological affinity to us have been extremely active and helpful in this campaign, not so much as organizations but as individuals,” Mr. Jaitley said. “As far as governance is concerned, we have been in power as a political party, and I can assure you we take our own decisions.” Ambiguity has long surrounded the R.S.S. It was founded in 1925 by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, an independence campaigner who had split from the Indian National Congress party over what he considered “undue pampering of the Muslims,” according to “R.S.S.: A Vision in Action,” published by the group in 1988. Its central ritual and recruiting tool is the morning drill, known as the daily shakha, which was designed to “create an all-Bharat national consciousness.” The Indian government banned the R.S.S. for 17 months in 1948 after a man associated with the group assassinated Mohandas Gandhi, and for brief periods in the 1970s and 1990s. Its opponents say it fuels religious conflict. For many years, the group has maintained that it has no involvement in Indian politics, saying its mission is focused on character-building. But many of its members have gone on to become candidates for the Bharatiya Janata Party, whose spokeswoman recently referred to the R.S.S. as the party’s “ideological fountainhead.” “The B.J.P. and the R.S.S. are married to each other,” said Dilip Deodhar, an analyst whose family has been active in the R.S.S. for generations. “The power is there, but it is like that of a mother over her children. The mother does not use it for anything but the child’s welfare. There is no abusing it.” The current campaign has thrust the group into an unusually public role. In October, the R.S.S.’s leader, Mohan Bhagwat, ordered the group and its affiliates to press for 100 percent voter turnout, according to Ram Madhav, a spokesman for the organization. Last week in Varanasi, an intense electoral battleground, some 5,000 R.S.S. volunteers were circulating — nearly as many as the 6,000 sent out by the B.J.P., according to Ashok Pandey, a B.J.P. spokesman.
0~Climate Change Poses ‘Systemic Threat’ to the Economy, Big Investors Warn~WASHINGTON — Climate change threatens to create turmoil in the financial markets, and the Federal Reserve and other regulators must act to avoid an economic disaster, according to a letter sent on Tuesday by a group of large investors. “The climate crisis poses a systemic threat to financial markets and the real economy, with significant disruptive consequences on asset valuations and our nation’s economic stability,” reads the letter, which was signed by more than three dozen pension plans, fund managers and other financial institutions that together manage almost $1 trillion in assets. That financial threat, combined with the physical risks posed by climate change, may create “disastrous impacts the likes of which we haven’t seen before,” the letter says. It urges the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies to “explicitly integrate climate change across your mandates.” Investors worry that if regulators do not act, climate change may cause the price of some companies to fall suddenly, the effects of which may ricochet through the economy. Providing more information about that risk — for example, by requiring companies to disclose more about their greenhouse gas emissions, or which of their facilities are at risk from rising seas — could help investors make better decisions.
0~To Make It to the Moon, Women Have to Escape Earth’s Gender Bias~NASA first planned to have extra-small, small, medium, large and extra-large suits. For budget reasons, the extra-small, small and extra-large suits were cut. However, many of the male astronauts could not fit into the large suits, so the bigger size was brought back. The smaller sizes never were. Cady Coleman, an astronaut who has flown on two space shuttles and traveled to the space station , stands 5 feet 4 inches tall and remains the smallest person to ever qualify for a spacewalk. While she was training in NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab, she had to improvise padding to wear inside her spacesuit. Without that, smaller people would have an air bubble inside their suits that would make them spin in the lab’s pool as if a beach ball were strapped to their stomachs. It would not be a problem in space, Ms. Coleman told me. “But the N.B.L. was where people decided if you had what it takes to do a spacewalk,” she said. And complaints? Well, no one else previously had that problem, so it must just be the person who complained. As a result, this gender bias became a mistake that we did not learn from, because the female astronauts compensated.
0~Texas Democrats Face Covid Outbreak and a Stalled Voting Rights Push~WASHINGTON — Democratic state lawmakers from Texas arrived in Washington last week with plans to apply unending pressure on the Senate to pass voting rights protections that would help counteract a Republican election overhaul bill back home. Then a Covid-19 outbreak stalled their progress. The entire delegation from Texas is now stuck at a Washington hotel after six of the Democratic state representatives tested positive for the coronavirus, and an official from Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office who met with them has also tested positive. All of those who have tested positive are fully vaccinated, but nobody in the capital is now particularly eager to meet in person with the group, which has resorted to virtual meetings. In the meantime, Senate Democratic leaders remain focused on passing an infrastructure package, President Biden is in a standoff with social media companies, and there has been no public sign that the Texas Democrats have won over any senators who weren’t already on board with their push to pass new federal voting legislation without clearing a 60-vote Senate threshold. They have not secured a group meeting with Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona or with any Republicans. (A state senator, who is not part of the group of House Democrats who first left Texas, did meet with Ms. Sinema, the senator’s office said.) And they cannot go home to Texas for another two and a half weeks or they will risk being arrested for leaving the state.
0~How Texas’ Power Generation Failed During the Storm, in Charts~A huge winter storm slammed Texas earlier this week, knocking out power plants and leaving millions of residents without electricity and heat for days, amid freezing conditions. A major part of the problem: The state’s power plants were not prepared for the frigid temperatures that accompanied the storm. Natural gas, coal and nuclear plants — which provide the bulk of Texas’ power in the winter — were knocked offline, and wind turbines froze, too. Texas’ Power Generation Took a Hit During the Storm.

But natural gas — which is a crucial power source when electricity usage peaks — was hit hardest. “All sources underperformed expectations,” said Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University in Houston. “But far, far more than everything else combined were the shortfalls from natural gas.” During the blackouts, the grid lost roughly five times as much power from natural gas as it did from wind. Natural gas production froze, and so did the pipelines that transport the gas. Once power plants went offline, they were not prepared to restart in the below-freezing conditions. Demand for natural gas to heat homes and businesses also spiked, contributing to shortages. And high gas prices further disrupted generation, as operators who could not turn a profit took their plants offline. Several coal plants and one of Texas’ four nuclear facilities were also knocked offline by cold temperatures. The usually-balmy state does not require power plants to be winterized — “as we've painfully come to find out,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at The University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute. Just as generation was dropping from the grid, demand for electricity in Texas hit a record high for winter, rivaling demand seen during some of the hottest summer days. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the majority of the state’s power grid, reported that demand peaked at 69,000 megawatts on Sunday, surpassing its planned worst-case scenario. Shortly after, the grid operator instructed utilities to begin controlled power outages to avoid longer-term damage.

Solar power By The New York Times · Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration Hourly Electric Grid Monitor; Seasonal Assessment of Resource Adequacy for the ERCOT Region, Winter 2020-21 | Note: This graphic accounts for ERCOT’s thermal, wind and solar generation. It does not include auxiliary and backup power supplies used during peak demand. In its seasonal risk assessment, ERCOT anticipated that “extreme” winter demand could spike as high as 67,000 megawatts statewide if conditions matched the 2011 ice storm that led to blackouts in parts of the state. Researchers estimate that had the grid been able to deliver it, power needed for heating would have pushed demand around 5,000 megawatts higher earlier this week. Governor Greg Abbott blamed the blackouts on solar and wind energy, but those power sources were not major players in the state’s emergency plans. Dr. Cohan said the state's emergency scenario wasn't so far off in some of its predictions, but it failed to anticipate the scale of outages caused by this winter storm, particularly among natural gas power plants. “None of their scenarios envisioned that we could possibly have over 30,000 megawatts of outages at the same time,” he said. “That’s more than double their worst-case.” Experts are still assembling a full picture of what contributed to the power failures and lawmakers have called for an investigation into ERCOT’s preparedness and handling of the situation.
0~Trump, Pence Lead G.O.P. Seizure of Late-Term Abortion as a Potent 2020 Issue~“It’s going to come into play, quite frankly, in the elections next year. We’re not going to let it go away,” Carol Tobias, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, the country’s largest anti-abortion group, said of New York’s law and Virginia’s defeated proposal. “You’re going to see articles written and speeches, and our affiliates around the country are going to take it up,” Ms. Tobias added. She singled out a video clip of the Virginia lawmaker, Kathy Tran, earlier this week acknowledging that her bill would allow, in certain circumstances, for a woman to request an abortion when she was about to give birth. Ms. Tran later clarified that she “misspoke” and that the bill would not allow the prevention of a live birth. Nonetheless, the clip of her initial comments, already viral, was further amplified when Virginia’s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, was asked during a radio interview on Wednesday about Ms. Tran’s bill. Mr. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, said late-term abortions would be permissible in cases of severe deformities or nonviable fetuses, and described a situation in which such an infant would be delivered, and then a “discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” How Times reporters cover politics.

Conservatives seized upon the answer as proof that Mr. Northam approved of killing an infant even after it was delivered, even as Mr. Northam’s office said the reply was taken out of context and called the idea that he would support such a proposal “disgusting.” “That’s going to be played in legislative bodies around the country or at least used to lobby,” Ms. Tobias, of the National Right to Life Committee, said. It already has: Virginia’s Republican Party sent a fund-raising email with the clip of the Virginia lawmaker; the National Republican Congressional Committee has also attacked several newly elected House Democrats from Virginia, trying to link them to the debate in the statehouse. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida likened the Democratic proposals to legalizing infanticide, and the former United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, said the idea made her sick.
0~Afghan War Casualty Report: November 2020~The following report compiles all significant security incidents confirmed by New York Times reporters throughout Afghanistan from the past seven days. It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials refuse to confirm casualty information. The report includes government claims of insurgent casualty figures, but in most cases these cannot be independently verified by The Times. Similarly, the reports do not include Taliban claims for their attacks on the government unless they can be verified. Both sides routinely inflate casualty totals for their opponents. Nov. 27-Dec. 3, 2020 At least 39 pro-government forces and four civilians were killed in Afghanistan the past week. The deadliest attack took place in Ghazni Province, where a military Humvee stolen by the Taliban and laden with explosives targeted a military base in Ghazni City, the provincial capital, killing 31 soldiers and wounding 24 others. The explosion was so powerful that it damaged several buildings on the base. In Zabul Province, a car bomb targeted the convoy of Atta Jan Haqbayan, the head of provincial council, killing three civilians and wounding 23 others, including Haqbayan. Afghan government and Taliban negotiators in Qatar agreed to the principles and procedures that will guide the ongoing peace negotiations between them, officials announced on Wednesday, an important move that could pave the way for talks that have been hobbled by disagreements for more than two months. [Read the Afghan War Casualty Report from previous weeks.] Dec. 3 Paktia Province: three security forces killed A car bomb targeted a patrol of Afghan forces in the southern part of Gardez, the provincial capital, killing three members of the National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan’s intelligence agency, and wounding 14 civilians.

0~Democrats for Low Wages~This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Virginia is notably hostile to labor unions. It’s one of only three states to ban government workers from bargaining collectively, and it also puts legal obstacles in the way of private sector unions. Not surprisingly, after Democrats took control of Virginia’s state legislature this year, they began considering a bill to make it easier for unions to enroll workers. Economic research has found that unionized workers earn roughly 15 percent more on average than otherwise similar workers who aren’t in a union. But, even as the Virginia legislature was passing a raft of other progressive legislation, the union bill died. One big factor appears to have been an economic analysis by a local business development group predicting that the bill would hurt the state’s economy. And what was the group’s evidence for the claim? A survey of local business executives and consultants, who said they liked Virginia’s hostility to unions and predicted the bill would damage the economy.
0~Long Island’s Schools Fail to Educate All Students, Study Says~“It could be an extraordinary catalyst for change,” Mr. Halpin said. “Our schools are not nearly as good as we think they are, they cost way too much and the education could be much better for the kids if the schools were organized differently. “We’re not getting the value we should, even in districts that are expending extraordinary amounts per student. And in high-needs areas, kids are literally trapped in districts that doom them to an inferior education. How many potential Barack Obamas are stuck out there?” The study found that as of 2005, the latest year for which data was compiled, wealthier districts on Long Island spent $25,708 annually per student, while poor ones spent $17,747. That gap produces disparities in class sizes, the number of computers and other resources. Yet taxes are often highest in beleaguered districts because of large enrollments and lower property values. With little commercial property in Roosevelt, for example, homeowners pay 90 percent of school taxes. In adjacent Uniondale, with a big chunk of the Roosevelt Field shopping mall, residents shoulder only 29 percent of their district’s taxes. “It’s very clear there has been an inequity in the financing of education on Long Island and throughout New York State,” Roosevelt’s school superintendent, Robert-Wayne Harris, said. “Unfortunately, in communities like Roosevelt, taxpayers have to bear the brunt.” He said he doubted that the Island was ready to merge districts. The study examined how much a typical annual tax bill would rise to enable a spending increase of $250 per student. For Fire Island, Amagansett, Bridgehampton and Quogue, it would be only a few dollars. But for Brentwood, Wyandanch, Hempstead and Roosevelt, it would come to more than $300. Image In Uniondale, adjacent to Roosevelt, homeowners pay 29 percent of their property taxes to support local school. Credit... Phil Marino for The New York Times State aid adjustments have failed to equalize the financing, the report said. Poor districts also have greater needs, like the growing number of immigrant children requiring help with English. That figure jumped to one in four students in 2007, from one in seven in 2001, the report said.

We routinely see four-wheelers nearly kill themselves to not be caught behind a big truck. Take your time. Stay safe. I like to imagine all the cute little cars swarming around me as being driven by my brothers, my friends, my mom. I feel responsible for their safety. My husband and I had a furious four-wheeler throw an oversized soda into the open window of our cab. Relax. Don’t succumb to road rage. Let’s all get there in one piece.

0~A Rainmaker Seeks to Grow His Firm at a Time of Big Media and Tech Deals~Since founding LionTree in 2012 with a fellow UBS alumnus, Ehren Stenzler, Mr. Bourkoff has steadily expanded the firm’s reach, opening offices in San Francisco, London and Paris. And he has begun to poach brand-name talent: Last year, LionTree hired Jake Donavan, who led European industry coverage for JPMorgan Chase’s investment bank, as president of its European division. “The pitch was, ‘help me build something fun and exciting,’” Mr. Donavan said in an interview. Referring to how Wall Street refers to tech, media and telecom, he added, “It’s a unique time in the T.M.T. ecosystem.” LionTree remains a relative minnow in the world of deal making. The 60-person firm has cracked the top 25 advisers on worldwide tech, media and telecom takeovers three times since its founding, according to Thomson Reuters. Its advisory business’s best year to date was in 2015, when it ranked eighth, outpacing every other independent bank. Last year, it ranked 24th, behind firms like Evercore and Raine Group. (LionTree did not have a role in the Disney deal, even though other boutique banks were involved.) But the company, whose offices reflect a sort of sleekly modernized “Mad Men” décor, match Mr. Bourkoff’s vision for what his bank should look like. Few in the firm have formal titles, in what is meant to create a “flat” organization in which young bankers can feel free to propose transaction ideas. Much effort has been spent on data analysis and reaching out to young tech start-ups run by millennial founders. LionTree has worked to grow its investment management business, which uses outside client money to invest in transactions, often alongside advisory clients. This year, the firm backed a new investment company, Ocelot, that will use the $425 million that it raised from public-market investors, including Mr. Malone, to buy a privately held business. And Mr. Bourkoff has also hired a number of advisers to serve as “entrepreneurs in residence,” including Ursula Burns, the former chief executive of Xerox, and Betsy Morgan, the former chief executive of Glenn Beck’s The Blaze, who are meant to both bring in business opportunities and come up with new initiatives. (It was Ms. Morgan, for instance, who helped come up with the idea of the firm’s KindredCast podcast, which has featured the likes of Mr. Moonves of CBS and the talent manager Scooter Braun.)
0~What is the Blockchain? Explaining the Tech Behind Cryptocurrencies~When a database is maintained by a single authority, if that authority gets compromised by a hacker, or even by natural disaster, the people relying on that database can lose access to all their data. With a blockchain, all the people relying on the database can keep and update their own copy of the data. Apart from the security, a lot of data is kept in a way that requires all the players to separately keep track of the records themselves. Banks, for instance, keep track of every transaction they do with other banks, even though the other banks are also keeping track of the same records. It costs a lot to make sure everyone’s records are in sync. Blockchains can potentially provide a more efficient way to do this so that everyone is always on the same page. If blockchains involve multiple computers all keeping track of data, what if they disagree? This issue, of how to keep everyone on the same page, is what the most important, but also the most confusing, bits of blockchain technology are aimed at resolving. In Bitcoin, the process of mining, or creating new Bitcoin, also has a second purpose of making sure everyone is making the same updates to their copy of the blockchain. Most virtual currencies have used this process to coordinate everyone on the blockchain. When blockchains don’t have a virtual currency, they have to find a different mechanism to get everyone to agree on new additions to the ledger. These mechanisms are called consensus algorithms, and they are among the most contentious pieces of blockchain design. Can anyone join any blockchain and help update the records? With most large virtual currencies, anyone can join in and see and help maintain the records. These are called public blockchains. This system has made many big players looking at the technology uncomfortable. Consequently, most corporations and governments have worked with so-called private blockchains, which only approved computers can see and join.
0~François Hollande Pardons French Woman Who Killed Abusive Husband~PARIS — In an unexpected move, President François Hollande of France granted a full pardon on Wednesday to a woman who had been sentenced to prison for murdering her husband after decades of domestic abuse. The woman, Jacqueline Sauvage, was found guilty by a criminal court in 2014 of shooting her husband, Norbert Marot, three times in the back with a hunting rifle in 2012. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison. “The president of the republic has estimated that Ms. Sauvage’s place was no longer in prison, but with her family,” said a statement from the president’s office announcing her full pardon. Mr. Hollande had commuted part of her sentence in January. Ms. Sauvage was released from a prison near Paris within hours of the announcement. “I’m deeply shaken, I wasn’t expecting it,” Carole Marot, one of Ms. Sauvage’s daughters, told French radio. “An infinite thanks to the president of the republic.”
0~In Idlib, Final Offensive in Syrian War May Come at Horrific Cost~BAGHDAD — On land, Syria’s government is mustering thousands of conscripts to bolster its depleted forces. At sea, a Russian naval flotilla is just offshore, ready to intervene with formidable firepower. In Idlib Province, millions of civilians are dreading what comes next. The warring sides in Syria’s long and merciless civil war are preparing for another brutal offensive, and this one may be the last. The looming assault on Idlib Province is the one the government in Damascus hopes will deliver the final military blow against the rebel fighters and their civilian supporters who rose up more than seven years ago demanding regime change. Where Syria and its Russian and Iranian allies see a chance to crush the remaining opposition, Western leaders warn of a humanitarian calamity in Idlib, where an estimated three million civilians live.
0~This Earth Day, Green Is the New Denim~See, for example, the environmental profit and loss statement that Kering created in 2010 and applied to Puma and is currently applying to all its luxury brands, with results due in 2016, or pretty much any of the assessments demanded of the member brands in the proliferating sustainability indexes from names like Dow Jones, Ethisphere and Corporate Knights. Or see two developments that stood out this week because (like the above) they reflect a relatively new willingness on fashion’s part to engage with the least mediagenic side of the issue. There’s just no good way to reduce these initiatives to an Instagram moment. And in an industry based on image, one that has embraced that social media platform above all others (to such an extent that the Council of Fashion Designers of America is actually giving Instagram its “media” award this June), that’s worth noting. First, Adidas, long a part of the above indexes, announced that it had signed a five-year “seven figure” contract to partner with an organization called Parley for the Oceans, which was created to publicize and tackle the problem of ocean plastic. It is the most long-term such initiative the company has signed to date, according to Eric Liedtke, head of global brands, and will involve both developing new plastic treatments that can be used in recycled polyester fabrics, and driving direct action. Translation: picking up plastic on the beach. And second, Maiyet, the socially conscious luxury brand started in 2010 to help create sustainable businesses in challenged regions of the world, embarked on its first supply-chain initiative, working with the Gobi Revival Fund to facilitate a vaccine program and “corral sanitation” for nomadic goat herders in Mongolia as part of a drive to source ethical cashmere. Effectively, it is committing about $200,000 a year to the project, as well as buying 40 tons of fiber directly from the farmers (as opposed to from the traditional Chinese middlemen), which will then be spun into cashmere in a factory in Italy, with practices assessed by Maiyet. It plans to sell the material at the Florentine yarn fair, Pitti Filati, ensuring quality and supply for their own products as well as for any other brand that buys it. Also, presumably, some profit for themselves.
0~Texas Urges Supreme Court to Leave Its Restrictive Abortion Law in Place~WASHINGTON — Texas’ attorney general urged the Supreme Court on Thursday to leave the state’s restrictive abortion law in place, saying that the federal government was not entitled to challenge it. If the justices are nonetheless inclined to hear the Justice Department’s request that they block the law while legal challenges proceed, wrote Ken Paxton, the state’s attorney general, they should use the case to overrule Roe v. Wade and to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion. The state law, which has been in effect since Sept. 1, bans most abortions after six weeks and makes no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. Abortion clinics in Texas have largely stopped performing the procedure, requiring women seeking abortions to travel out of state. The law, known as Senate Bill 8, was intended to evade review in federal court. It barred state officials from enforcing the law and deputized private individuals to sue anyone who performed an abortion or assisted with it in any way, including by providing counseling, financial assistance or a ride to the clinic.
0~Joe Biden Weighing Unique Steps to Reassure Voters Concerned About His Age~Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., aware that concerns about his age could weigh on his candidacy if he runs for the White House, has discussed two steps that could reassure voters about electing a 78-year-old president next year. Mr. Biden and his top advisers are considering nodding to the rising next generation in Democratic politics — and elevating an heir — by announcing a running mate early, well before the nomination is sealed. Also under discussion is a possible pledge to serve only one term and framing Mr. Biden’s 2020 campaign as a one-time rescue mission for a beleaguered country, according to multiple party officials. Such moves would amount to a big play that would send a signal about the seriousness of the election, and could potentially appeal to both liberal activists and general-election voters who are eager to chart the safest route toward defeating President Trump. But Mr. Biden is not sold on either approach, and both carry significant risks, chiefly that they could call further attention to the age of a candidate who would turn 80 in the White House. There is also the risk that Mr. Biden could appear presumptuous — even imperious — by choosing a running mate before the electorate has the chance to sift the field of candidates, presenting voters with a two-person package before anyone has voted for even the top spot on the ticket. More than a dozen people are running in the Democratic primary, including a record number of women and minorities, and announcing a running mate too soon could foreclose the possibility of uniting the party by inviting a popular runner-up to join the ticket later.
0~Cuomo Proposes Higher-Education Initiative in New York Prisons~“If we don’t provide an exit strategy for ex-offenders, they are just going to be re-offenders,” Mr. Vance said. “It’s just really common sense.” The college initiative is part of a broader agenda touching on criminal justice reform and social issues that the governor outlined on Sunday, including seeking an additional $100 million for so-called community schools, which aim to address challenges for students beyond the classroom, an approach tried in New York City and other urban areas. He also wants $55 million for jobs programs for at-risk youths, a category that includes those who have committed crimes. Image Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. Credit... Branden Camp/Associated Press The governor also announced an agreement with the state Office of Court Administration to stop making some juvenile criminal records available for purchase from private data and background check companies. That change, expected to take effect this month, comes in conjunction with a recent executive action by the governor to pardon as many as 10,000 people who were convicted of nonviolent crimes as 16- and 17-year-olds but have since avoided criminal activity. Some state prisons already offer a handful of college courses, but Mr. Vance said the new initiative would expand those programs by about a third. It would also improve them so that credits could be more easily transferred to colleges outside prison walls, a problem that has bedeviled the existing system. The proposal would offer colleges and other educational institutions up to $5,000 per student to provide a full-time course load of 30 college credits, according to the district attorney’s office. Only inmates who have a high school degree and are within two to five years of completing their sentences would be eligible. Those serving life sentences would be disqualified. Mr. Vance said studies had shown that educated inmates were less likely to commit crimes when they left prison, an outcome even law-and-order-minded prosecutors could embrace.
0~Disney to Reveal Plans to Turbocharge Streaming Offerings~LOS ANGELES — A significant expansion of the “Star Wars” universe. Tom Hanks as Geppetto in a live-action “Pinocchio,” and Yara Shahidi as Tinker Bell in a live-action “Peter Pan & Wendy.” Footage from new Marvel projects. A star-studded prequel to “The Lion King.” On Thursday, as part of a four-hour investor presentation focused on streaming, the Walt Disney Company will discuss a Death Star-size trove of coming content — all of the above and more, said three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private planning. Some big-budget Disney movies will continue to have exclusive runs in theaters. (The “Lion King” project, directed by Barry Jenkins and focused on Mufasa’s back story, is a good bet.) Others will debut online. (That is where “Pinocchio” is headed.) All will ultimately serve one goal, which is strengthening Disney+, the company’s flagship streaming service. At a time when streaming is becoming cuttingly competitive — and some of Disney’s traditional businesses are struggling — Disney hopes to use the virtual event to dazzle Wall Street: Here is a 97-year-old company making a jump to direct-to-consumer hyperspace.
0~U.S. Sees Direct Threat in Attack at Kenya Mall~NAIROBI, Kenya — Viewing the deadly siege at a shopping mall in Kenya as a direct threat to its security, the United States is deploying dozens of F.B.I. agents to investigate the wreckage, hoping to glean every piece of information possible to help prevent such a devastating attack from happening again, possibly even on American soil. For years, the F.B.I. has been closely watching the Shabab, the Somali Islamist group that has claimed responsibility for the Nairobi massacre and recruited numerous Americans to fight and die — sometimes as suicide bombers — for its cause. The Shabab has already attacked most of the major actors trying to end the chaos in Somalia — the United Nations, Uganda, aid groups, the Somali government and now Kenya. The United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars bankrolling anti-Shabab operations for years, and there is growing fear that the group could turn its sights on American interests more directly, one of the reasons the Obama administration is committing so many resources to the investigation in Kenya. “We are in this fight together,” said Robert F. Godec, the American ambassador to Kenya. “The more we know about the planning that went into this, the way it was conducted, what was used, the people involved, the better we can protect America, too.”
0~Supreme Court Upholds Ohio’s Purge of Voting Rolls~The case concerned Larry Harmon, a software engineer and Navy veteran who lives near Akron, Ohio. He voted in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections but did not vote in 2012, saying he was unimpressed by the candidates. He also sat out the midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. But in 2015, Mr. Harmon did want to vote against a ballot initiative to legalize marijuana and found that his name had been stricken from the voting rolls. State officials said that they had done so after sending Mr. Harmon a notice in 2011 asking him to confirm his eligibility to vote and that he did not respond. Mr. Harmon said he did not remember receiving a notice, but he was dropped from the voter rolls. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, ruled in favor of Mr. Harmon in 2016, saying that Ohio had violated the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 by using the failure to vote as a “trigger” for sending the notices. The Supreme Court reversed that ruling, allowing the approach by Ohio, which is more aggressive than any other state in purging its voter rolls. After skipping a single federal election cycle, voters are sent a notice. If they fail to respond and do not vote in the next four years, their names are purged from the rolls. A few other states use similar approaches, but not one of them moves as fast. “Ohio is the only state that commences such a process based on the failure to vote in a single federal election cycle,” said a brief from the League of Women Voters and the Brennan Center for Justice. “Literally every other state uses a different, and more voter-protective, practice.”

0~Labor Secretary Faces Demands to Resign Over Epstein Plea Deal~Congress’s top Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, called for his resignation, as did The Miami Herald, which uncovered the details of the plea deal. “If Acosta, when he was U.S. attorney in Miami, had shown an ounce of sympathy for the vulnerable girls Epstein sexually exploited, they would have had a powerful voice on their side,” the paper wrote in an editorial. Mr. Trump, in remarks while he met with the emir of Qatar, said on Tuesday that he felt “badly” for Mr. Acosta and praised him as “an excellent secretary of labor.” He added, “I do hear that there were a lot of people involved in that decision, not just him,” a reference to the Epstein deal. But he said the White House would look into the matter “very carefully.” Two senior administration officials said Mr. Trump’s support for Mr. Acosta could quickly evaporate if more damaging details emerged about the plea agreement. Republican senators, who all voted to confirm Mr. Acosta, were cagey in their defense. “To the degree there’s new information, I think people are willing to take a look at that,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. “But I think most people believe that he went through a very thorough vetting process when he got his current job.” Mr. Acosta ran the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department during George W. Bush’s administration before landing the top spot at the United States attorney’s office in Miami. He left after the end of the Bush administration to become dean of the law school at Florida International University. Mr. Acosta, who graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, was tapped to be labor secretary after the president’s first choice, Andrew F. Puzder, withdrew his nomination once his business record came under attack. Championed by Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, both Cuban-Americans like Mr. Acosta, he sailed through the confirmation process in April 2017 with the Epstein incident barely mentioned.
0~Cisco to Pay $8.6 Million to Settle Government Claims of Flawed Tech~WASHINGTON — Cisco Systems agreed on Wednesday to pay $8.6 million to settle claims that it sold video surveillance technology that it knew had a significant security flaw to federal, state and local government agencies. Cisco will pay civil damages in connection with software that it sold to various government agencies, including Homeland Security, the Secret Service, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a government complaint unsealed on Wednesday. Eighteen states, including New York and California, and the District of Columbia joined the Justice Department in the claim against Cisco, one of the world’s largest sellers of software and equipment to businesses and governments; 15 states and the District of Columbia recovered under the settlement. The case was filed in the Federal District Court for the Western District of New York under the False Claims Act, which addresses fraud and misconduct in federal government contracts. The government said the video surveillance software it bought from Cisco was “of no value” because it did not “meet its primary purpose: enhancing the security of the agencies that purchase it.” In many cases, the Cisco software actually reduced the protection provided by other security systems, the complaint said.
0~Ex-Military Leader in China Is Subject of Graft Inquiry~HONG KONG — A former commander of the People’s Liberation Army was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party and placed under investigation for graft crimes on Thursday, becoming the most senior military figure brought down in President Xi Jinping’s campaign against corruption. The fall of retired Gen. Guo Boxiong had been rumored since last year, and was hinted at in Chinese news reports earlier this year that laid out graft accusations against his son. But the party’s announcement of charges against General Guo amounted to an emphatic rejection of assertions that Mr. Xi was losing his appetite for investigating top-level corruption, or for “fighting tigers,” in his often-quoted words. “The notion that hunting tigers has slowed can be laid to rest,” said a commentary issued online by the People’s Daily, the party’s main newspaper, of General Guo. He derived illicit riches from his influence over promotions in the People’s Liberation Army, said the party leaders’ decision, issued by Xinhua, the main official news agency.
0~The Bail Reform Backlash That Has Democrats at War~Those opponents have helped funnel a parade of negative stories to the press about crimes allegedly committed by those released under the law. New York City tabloids have regularly featured cover stories of repeat perpetrators, including several anti-Semitic incidents, while upstate communities have been rattled by incidents such as a deadly accident that resulted in the death of a 9-year-old, in which the driver was released with a desk appearance ticket. The rancor had been intensified by accusations that some opponents are deliberately misleading the public, exemplified by a case in Long Island last week: The Nassau County police commissioner, Patrick Ryder, initially blamed the death of a 36-year-old man in an MS-13 gang case, Wilmer Maldonado Rodriguez, on the changes to the law on discovery, rules about when the prosecution must turn over evidence to the defense. Under the new law, prosecutors must automatically turn over evidence, generally within 15 days of arraignment. In the hours after Mr. Ryder’s statements, activists excoriated Nassau County officials for spreading misinformation and unfairly attacking the law. Mr. Ryder quickly retracted his assertion, saying there was “no direct link” between Mr. Rodriguez’s death and criminal justice reform. Despite that, Attorney General Barr appeared to use the case on Tuesday to criticize New York’s criminal justice laws, telling a group of county sheriffs that “a member of the community” had been “killed by an MS-13 member who was released under new legal reforms in New York.” A request for clarification from his office was not returned. Supporters of the law were so concerned about the attention given to Mr. Ryder’s comments that they launched a six-figure television campaign on Long Island to call out Mr. Ryder’s actions.
0~Abu Dhabi Is to Gain a Louvre of Its Own~PARIS, Jan. 12 — After months of rumors and a week of protests, the French government has finally confirmed that in exchange for a sum said to be $800 million to $1 billion, it will rent the name, art treasures and expertise of the Louvre to a new museum to be built in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. A formal agreement is expected to be signed later this month, with the new “Louvre” — one of five museums planned for a multibillion-dollar tourist development on Saadiyat Island, off Abu Dhabi — to open in 2012. Critics of the plan — some 2,400 signers of a petition accusing France of “selling its soul” in hopes of scuttling the deal — have been dismissed as “grumpy spirits” by the French culture minister, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres. The decision, he said, has been made. Such is the power of the French government. It owns most major French museums and, by all accounts, President Jacques Chirac has concluded that this is one global market where France can compete effectively. On matters of state, the Louvre’s opinion, reportedly unenthusiastic in this case, carries little weight.

According to prepared remarks submitted before Friday’s hearing and obtained by The New York Times, he planned to say that those actions meant to improve efficiency were unfairly twisted for political ends to suggest, incorrectly, that Republicans wanted to use the mail to help erode confidence in the election. “I recognize that it has become impossible to separate the necessary long-term reform efforts we will need to undertake from the broader political environment surrounding the election,” Mr. DeJoy plans to tell senators. “And I do not want to pursue any immediate efforts that might be utilized to tarnish the Postal Service brand, particularly as it relates to our role in the democratic process.” How Times reporters cover politics.

Thursday’s hearing centered in part on the role played by Mr. Mnuchin, one of Mr. Trump’s longest-serving cabinet members, who has been focused on overhauling the Postal Service. Mr. Trump assigned the Treasury secretary in 2018 to lead a task force to study ways to reform the Postal Service, which the president has accused of essentially subsidizing e-commerce companies such as Amazon by charging too little. He has demanded higher shipping prices. Mr. Mnuchin on Thursday rebutted suggestions that he had done anything but play a proper role as the federal government’s lender to the Postal Service and in fulfilling his duty to try to help fix its financial woes. In a letter to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, Mr. Mnuchin explained his role as the chairman of the Federal Financing Bank, the Postal Service’s sole lender, and said he did not intervene to pave the way for Mr. DeJoy to be the postmaster general. “Neither I nor any other Treasury official played any role in recruiting or suggesting Mr. DeJoy for the position of postmaster general,” Mr. Mnuchin wrote, adding that he was surprised to learn about the selection.
0~In Hong Kong, a Vast Citizens’ Network Keeps Watch on the Police~HONG KONG — As protests and arrests have become routine across Hong Kong, online groups, some with more than 100,000 members, have formed to document arrests and police action during protests and at other times. Recent videos of arrested protesters from Telegram Nov. 20#TinShuiWai 2 female 1 male, students Dec. 11850 #MongKok 1 female arrested Dec. 4#ToKwaWan 0730 1 male student arrested Dec. 82354 #MongKok Fa Yuen Street, 1 arrested Dec. 90323 #SheungShui Arrested people in police car Dec. 152244 #MongKok On AM7196, blue jacket, black shirt A bus was blocking traffic on a recent night in Mong Kok, a busy shopping district. Someone had activated the emergency brake, a tactic sometimes used by protesters to disrupt normal life in Hong Kong even when there aren't major demonstrations. Police officers pursued a 16-year-old to a nearby street and pinned him to the ground as they arrested him. Video from Telegram; annotation by The New York Times According to a police report sent to The New York Times, the arrest happened at 8:14 p.m. At the same time that night, reports of the arrest began streaming into Telegram, an online social network used by protesters to organize. Posts on Telegram channel for reporting arrests 2013 #MongKok 3 plain clothes officers arrested 1 8:14 p.m. 2015 #MongKok Near Mong Kok Center, 1 arrested 8:16 p.m. 2013 #MongKok 3 plain clothes officers arrested 1 8:14 p.m. 2015 #MongKok Near Mong Kok Center, 1 arrested 8:16 p.m. A small crowd gathered. Two plainclothes officers tried to handcuff the teenager. Bystanders demanded that another officer show police identification. One officer responded: “I don’t have to tell you anything. You don’t need to know.” As the teenager was pinned to the ground, he repeatedly yelled out his name and identification number. He also said that he would not kill himself, a reference to rumors about the circumstances of a teenager’s death in October that the police had classified as a suicide. A few minutes later, a bystander uploaded a video of the arrest to Telegram. Dozens of riot police soon arrived, pointing long guns at people. The crowd backed up, but at least several witnesses continued to record video. The protests, now in their seventh month, have grown tense. Violent confrontations are frequent. Protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails and vandalized property, and the police have responded with force, including mass arrests. Allegations of abuse during arrests and inside police stations have created fear among protesters. Lawyers have reported difficulty in finding arrested protesters, sometimes having to visit multiple police stations before locating them. Some lawyers have reported that the police coerced their clients into giving statements without a lawyer present. Driven by a deep mistrust of the police, an ad hoc online network has formed to report and follow up on arrests. Unconfirmed reports of arrests on Telegram Posts from Nov. 18 to Dec. 16 from a Telegram channel. For dozens of arrests each week, users post photos and videos to the online groups. That night in Mong Kok, the crowd watched closely as the young man was taken away in an ambulance because of injuries suffered during the arrest. Many stood guard until the last officer left the scene, sending updates to online channels. The police did not respond to a request for comment on the messaging channels where such information has been shared. The license plate of the ambulance that took the arrestee away was reported to the channel. Later that night, a message was posted to the channel saying that the teenager’s family was with him.

0~Trisha Brown, Choreographer and Pillar of American Postmodern Dance, Dies at 80~Trisha Brown, the choreographer and exemplar of the founding generation of American postmodern dance, died on Saturday in San Antonio. She was 80. Barbara Dufty, the executive director of Ms. Brown’s dance company, confirmed the death. Ms. Brown had been treated for vascular dementia since 2011. Few dance inventors have so combined the cerebral and sensuous sides of dance as Ms. Brown did, and few have been as influential. Her choreography, showcased primarily in New York, helped shape generations of modern dance creators into the 21st century. [ Mikhail Baryshnikov, Laurie Anderson and other artists speak on working with Ms. Brown. ] In December 2012, it was announced that the two dances she had made the previous year would be her last. By that point, she had been an international figure for over 30 years, choreographing for the Paris Opera Ballet, collaborating with Mikhail Baryshnikov, and commissioning stage designs from Robert Rauschenberg and other eminent visual artists, including Donald Judd and Nancy Graves.
0~Legalizing Marijuana, With a Focus on Social Justice, Unites 2020 Democrats~“I say this as the father of a middle school student, where middle schools are one of the fastest growing markets for marijuana sales today,” he told a coffeehouse crowd. “In the black market, they do not ID — they do not care — as long as they can make that sale.” The 2020 Democratic hopeful who may be most vulnerable on marijuana policy is former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who in the 1980s and 90s was a leader in the “war on drugs.’’ He championed laws that set tough mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, including possessing large amounts of marijuana. This led to an era of mass incarceration, with a lasting economic and social toll for minorities. “In 1994 Biden had a fairly mainstream position, but in 2020 that position is so far from the mainstream of Democratic politics that it is almost offensive,” said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who focuses on state and federal marijuana policy. He called Mr. Biden’s history on criminal justice issues “his biggest liability in the 2020 primary.” Mr. Biden has apologized for parts of his record, calling a law from the 1980s requiring harsher penalties for crack cocaine than powder cocaine — the former was more popular with African-Americans and the latter with whites — “a big mistake.” Spokesmen for Mr. Biden, who has told aides he is 95 percent committed to getting into the presidential race, did not respond to requests for comment. Two Democratic senators opposed to legalizing marijuana at the federal level — Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who entered the race last month, and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who opted out of running this month — represent battleground states in the Midwest, whose politics are less progressive than the coastal states that led the way to legalizing cannabis for adults.
0~Where the Titanic Shipwreck Rests, New Photos Reveal Extensive Decay~In the 34 years since the R.M.S. Titanic was discovered on the seafloor south of Newfoundland, it has become the world’s most famous shipwreck — a rusting hulk assailed by hundreds of explorers and moviemakers, salvors and tourists, scientists and federal watchdogs. All agree that the once-grand ship is rapidly falling apart. Resting on the icy North Atlantic seabed more than two miles down, upright but split in two, the fragile mass is slowly succumbing to rust, corrosive salts, microbes and colonies of deep-sea creatures. This month, a team from Triton Submarines captured video of the iconic wreck with human-occupied submersible s, in order to assess its status and anticipate the trajectory of its deterioration. The company called it the first such visit in nearly 14 years. “It was kind of a cool thing to see the ocean reclaiming it,” said Patrick Lahey, the president of Triton, who surveyed the wreck himself during one of the dives.
0~Greek Parliament Approves First Balanced Budget in Decades~ATHENS — Greece’s Parliament early on Monday approved a budget for 2015 that foresees extensive tax cuts and solid growth despite continuing negotiations with creditors over economic policy and questions about the country’s prospects for emerging from a punishing international bailout. The budget was approved 155 to 134 in the 300-seat House after days of vehement debate, with political tensions high as a possible election looms next year. Before the vote, thousands of Greeks joined a peaceful gathering outside the Parliament building to protest austerity policies by successive governments, which have slashed household incomes by a third and pushed unemployment to 26 percent. In a speech before Parliament, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said the blueprint, the first balanced budget in decades, signaled Greece’s gradual emergence from six tough years of recession. “We are leading the country to a new era where we can offer relief,” he said. “We are reducing the deficit to zero.” Apart from a deficit target of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product, the budget predicts that the Greek economy, which has shrunk by a quarter in the past five years, will expand by 2.9 percent of G.D.P. in 2015 after a timid return to growth this year. It also promises relief, notably 30 percent reductions in a tax on heating oil and an income tax surcharge.
0~Trump-Kim Deal Promises Answers for Families of Korean War M.I.A.s~Air Force Lt. Hal Downes’s B-26 bomber was on a nighttime run over North Korea when it went down in 1952. Did he die in the crash? Was he captured? His family never knew. They hoped they might at least be able to bring his body home when the fighting was over. But the war never formally ended. This week, the Downeses and the families of thousands of other Americans still missing from the Korean conflict received a jolt of hope when President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, signed a joint statement in Singapore that included a promise to recover and repatriate all American war dead in the North. The two sides agreed to the same thing after the 1953 armistice but have made only sporadic progress to accomplish it since then, and almost none in the last 13 years of mounting tensions over the North’s nuclear program. Now, the Singapore statement holds the prospect that the work might soon resume.
0~Maurice Hilleman, Master in Creating Vaccines, Dies at 85~Dr. Maurice R. Hilleman, a microbiologist who developed vaccines for mumps, measles, chickenpox, pneumonia, meningitis and other diseases, saving tens of millions of lives, died yesterday at a hospital in Philadelphia. He was 85. The cause was cancer, said a son-in-law, Greg Slamowitz. Raised on a farm in Montana, Dr. Hilleman credited much of his success to his boyhood work with chickens, whose eggs form the foundation of so many vaccines. Much of modern preventive medicine is based on Dr. Hilleman's work, though he never received the public recognition of Salk, Sabin or Pasteur. He is credited with having developed more human and animal vaccines than any other scientist, helping to extend human life expectancy and improving the economies of many countries. Dr. Hilleman probably saved more lives than any other scientist in the 20th century, said two medical leaders, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Paul A. Offit, chief of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.
0~Federal Court Rules Texas’ ID Law Violates Voting Rights Act~HOUSTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that Texas’ voter identification law, one of the strictest in the country, violated the Voting Rights Act and that the state must find ways to accommodate voters who face hardships in obtaining the necessary documents. Democrats and voting rights advocates hailed the ruling as a significant victory in one of the nation’s most closely watched voting rights cases. It was the fourth time in nearly four years that a federal court found that the Texas law discriminated against or disproportionately affected black and Hispanic voters. “The court got it right, recognizing the stink of discrimination,” said Trey Martinez Fischer, a state representative who is the chairman of the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus, one of several minority groups, voters and Democratic lawmakers who sued Texas over the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, found that the law had a discriminatory effect on blacks and Latinos, who often lack the forms of identification required under the Texas law. But the ruling did not strike down the law entirely, ruling instead that new procedures must be found to assist potential voters lacking the required identification.
0~Behind Joe Biden’s Thinking on a Female Running Mate~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” [music] Today: Two weeks ago, the biggest story in the country was the Democratic presidential primary. Now, with the coronavirus, it’s been largely forgotten. Alex Burns on what happened when those two stories collided. It’s Monday, March 23. michael barbaro Hello? alex burns Hello, Michael. michael barbaro Hey. It’s always nice to be heralded by a bing, you know? alex burns Is that not your usual entrance into halls and rooms? michael barbaro Usually it’s trumpets. [LAUGHS] I feel like every day pretty much for two weeks, we would talk on the show. And then poof, we have this unplanned hiatus, and you go away. And so I kind of miss you a little bit. alex burns [LAUGHS] It’s a particularly painful kind of social isolation, for me at least. michael barbaro So, bring us up to speed on the Democratic primary. How would you describe the current state of the race? alex burns Well, it’s pretty close to over at this point. Joe Biden has emerged as the overwhelming favorite to be the Democratic nominee. He clearly has a support from the majority of the party, wide lead in the delegate count. And Bernie Sanders has not conceded the race, but he’s acknowledged that he is sort of reassessing his campaign. And that’s often the first stage in the process of winding things down. michael barbaro So in effect, it feels like what you just described is more or less where we were a couple of weeks ago. But with the benefit of some hindsight and some reporting on your part, I wonder if you could tell us how exactly that happened, because I don’t think we’ve properly accounted for the whiplash and the speed with which the Sanders campaign came kind of crashing down. alex burns No, I don’t think we have. And I think really, you have to rewind the tape almost exactly a month ago to what was the high point. archived recording (bernie sanders) And now, I’m delighted to bring you some pretty good news. [CHEERING] I think all of you know, we won the popular vote in Iowa. [CHEERING] We won the New Hampshire primary. [CHEERING] And according to three networks in the A.P., we have now won the Nevada caucus! [CHEERING] alex burns He wins the Nevada caucuses. And he wins them by just an enormous margin. archived recording (crowd) Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! alex burns He crushes Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg. archived recording (crowd) Bernie! Bernie! Bernie! alex burns He wins young voters. He wins older voters. He wins folks who have participated in caucuses in the past and people who are participating for the first time. It’s in Nevada, where we see him go from winning about a quarter of the vote to winning nearly half the vote. archived recording (bernie sanders) And no campaign has a grass-roots movement like we do, which is another reason why we’re going to win this election. [CROWD CHEERING] alex burns And that sends a really powerful signal across the Democratic Party. michael barbaro And what does that signal? alex burns I think what most of us thought at the time was that it was sending a signal that Bernie Sanders was broadening his appeal, and that he was building a more diverse and more muscular political coalition than he had been able to demonstrate so far. It’s also clear now that another message it sent to the rest of the Democratic Party was that Sanders was becoming a real freight train in this race. And that if you were going to stop him, you were going to need to do it real fast. So the moment where Sanders is riding high like that, I think he’s kind of faced with a choice of either trying to more actively reassure the Democratic Party that they can trust him to be the nominee — and to make a more explicit case about his own electability and to address himself more clearly to moderate voters who have, you know, been beyond wary of his campaign, just terrified of the idea of nominating him. Or he can stick with the approach that got him there to begin with. And that’s to run as this anti-establishment progressive populist who is taking on his own party in addition to taking on the Republican Party. And the question then I think is, which version are we going to hear over the coming week and the coming months from Bernie Sanders? michael barbaro And what happens? alex burns The day after he wins the Nevada caucuses, a “60 Minutes” interview airs. archived recording (anderson cooper) Back in the 1980s, Sanders had some positive things to say about the former Soviet Union and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. archived recording (bernie sanders) And everybody was totally convinced — archived recording (anderson cooper) Here he is explaining why the Cuban people didn’t rise up and help the U.S. overthrow Cuban leader, Fidel Castro. archived recording (bernie sanders) He educated their kids, gave them health care — alex burns The piece of it that really pops out to a lot of Democrats is when Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders about his past praise for the Castro regime in Cuba. archived recording (bernie sanders) We’re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba. But it’s unfair to simply say, everything is bad. When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro — alex burns And it just sends a shockwave through Democrats. [music] archived recording Bernie Sanders has the lead in total votes in delegates. But his comments he made Sunday night on “60 Minutes” that are causing fresh panic for some Democrats. archived recording 1 It’s absolutely inconceivable that any American as old as him, knowing everything we know about Fidel Castro and the people that he’s murdered over the years, that anybody could support him in any way. archived recording 2 The blowback is emblematic of broader uncertainty about how nominating a self-described democratic socialist could impact Democrats’ chances in the general election. archived recording 3 I like Bernie. archived recording 4 How do you feel about him praising the Soviet Union and Fidel Castro? archived recording 5 Yeah, I don’t like that part. alex burns So to hear that from Sanders, and to hear him essentially be unapologetic about it, I think, was a real sign to people that if you thought this guy was going to start moving to the middle now, that is not happening. archived recording His response infuriated democratic lawmakers from South Florida, a key swing state where public support for the Castro regime is a nonstarter. alex burns More specifically, and in a more localized, but really no less important way, this is terrifying to Democrats in Florida. archived recording (reporter) Freshman Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, she called Sanders’s comment quote, “absolutely unacceptable.” archived recording (debbie mucarsel-powell) He made more than a mistake. It’s what he believes. And it’s unacceptable to our community. archived recording (reporter) And Congresswoman Donna Shalala, who suggested that Sanders talk to her constituents before quote, “singing the praises of a murderous tyrant“, unquote. alex burns You see just a unified, almost unified, wall of criticism of Sanders coming from Democrats in that state, saying, you are imperiling the general election in one of the biggest swing states on the map. [music] After the “60 Minutes” interview, you then start to hear prominent national Democrats say something that many of them haven’t said so far, which is, we just can’t nominate this guy. archived recording (jim clyburn) Let me thank all of you for joining us here this morning. alex burns And that’s the point where you see Joe Biden get a major, major endorsement from Jim Clyburn, popular congressman from South Carolina, highest ranking African-American member of Congress. archived recording (jim clyburn) Well, I want the public to know that I’m voting for Joe Biden. South Carolinans should be voting for Joe Biden. And here’s why. I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us. archived recording That’s right. That’s right. archived recording (jim clyburn) That’s important. alex burns So we head into the South Carolina primary, which Joe Biden was always favored to win. archived recording NBC News is now projecting that former Vice President Joe Biden has won a decisive victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary. alex burns And he wins it by 30 points. archived recording And he has done so by a substantial margin, potentially changing the dynamics of a race dominated so far by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. alex burns That is beyond what even the Biden campaign was expecting. Biden just coalesces the overwhelming majority of Democrats who are not for Bernie Sanders behind his campaign. michael barbaro And so why in that moment did we not see Biden’s win in South Carolina, which as you just said, was kind of mathematically quite significant as the beginning of a turning point kind of comeback? alex burns So on the night of South Carolina, we can look at Biden’s 30 point margin, and say, wow, that was impressive. And this guy is clearly more resilient than even some of his supporters, even some of his inner circle believed he was. What we didn’t know is that the next day — archived recording (pete buttigieg) So tonight, I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency. alex burns — Pete Buttigieg would drop out of the race. archived recording (pete buttigieg) I will no longer — alex burns And then on Monday morning, Amy Klobuchar would drop out of the race. archived recording (amy klobuchar) Today, I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president. [CROWD CHEERING] alex burns And by the end of Monday — archived recording (pete buttigieg) That I’m delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president. [CROWD CHEERING] alex burns — both of them would endorse Joe Biden. archived recording (beto o'rourke) I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden. [CROWD CHEERING] alex burns And by the way, so would Beto O’Rourke, who dropped out of the race a couple of months ealier. We saw a transformation of voter’s preferences within this field at a speed that I don’t think it’s an overstatement to call it totally unprecedented. michael barbaro I want to understand this phenomenon. Let me just begin with those endorsements that you just described. Why did Buttigieg, did Klobuchar drop out and endorse him so quickly? What’s your understanding now of how that happened? alex burns There are a couple of things going on here. Pete Buttigieg was on track to get totally waxed on Super Tuesday, which is just three days after South Carolina. So he is staring at the possibility of not just defeat and not just a setback, but something like political humiliation to go in a month from essentially winning Iowa — basically splitting the win with Bernie Sanders — to winning absolutely nothing on Super Tuesday. And so there is a logic of self-interest that says, maybe you should take your winnings and walk away from the table at this point. Amy Klobuchar faces a somewhat different situation because she does look like she will win her home state of Minnesota. But she is clear-eyed enough at that point to recognize there’s really no path forward for her in the race beyond Super Tuesday. Beyond the self-interest, though, these are two of the candidates who have been the bluntest and most pointed all along about their concern for the implications of nominating Sanders. They have been talking about the idea of nominating Sanders as deeply, deeply politically risky. And there are people who can do the math for themselves and see that after Nevada and South Carolina, there are really only two candidates in this race who are putting up big numbers on the national level in the way that it would take to go the distance. And between those two candidates, there’s no question about whether they’re closer to Biden or Sanders. michael barbaro OK, so at this point, post-South Carolina and post-Super Tuesday, Biden is the front-runner. But there’s a ton of primaries and delegates left. And still theoretically, time for a Sanders comeback, right? alex burns Right, and it turns out to be very much a theoretical exercise, the Sanders comeback. You see starting right after Super Tuesday, he points the way to the next round of primaries, most importantly, Michigan. archived recording Well, the “Joementum” continues. Former Vice President Biden swooping to victory overnight in a pivotal primary contest. alex burns Sanders ends up totally flopping in Michigan. It’s a blowout in the state. archived recording Biden sweeping every county in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi. He also won Idaho. The wins giving him a commanding 160 delegate lead over Sanders. alex burns And what happens, essentially the night that Biden wins in Michigan and in a number of other important states, is that the campaign is essentially frozen in place by a force that hits the campaign and hits the entire country in a way that nobody could have anticipated. And of course, that’s the coronavirus. [music] michael barbaro We’ll be right back. Alex, how exactly does the coronavirus epidemic — eventually becomes a pandemic — how does that hurt Sanders and help Biden? That’s not entirely intuitive to me. alex burns Well, what it does is it essentially ends the active portion of the campaign. On the night of the March 10 primaries, both of them are supposed to hold election night events where they address a roaring crowd of supporters. Both of those events get canceled. There have been no campaign rallies since then. Bernie Sanders cannot hit the road and gather tens of thousands of people in stadiums and deliver a forceful plea to the Democratic Party to not go ahead and nominate Joe Biden. The window to make that argument has essentially closed. What’s also going on is that the terms of debate go from being about ideological differences and policy differences to the reality of a terrifying national crisis. And what we see consistently in public polling for months, and in exit polls taken around the March primaries, is that on the question of which candidate you trust to handle a major crisis, Joe Biden is overwhelmingly favored, not just over Bernie Sanders, but over every alternative that democratic voters had in the race. michael barbaro So in a sense, the coronavirus doesn’t just freeze the campaign and freeze Joe Biden’s advantages electorally, it amplifies them because many democratic voters see him as a crisis-style leader. alex burns Exactly. Biden’s biggest strengths from the beginning have involved his experience, and his perceived steadiness, and the fact that voters basically find him trustworthy, and reassuring. michael barbaro Well, that’s interesting because another way of thinking about this, and the impact that we’re seeing already on Americans from this pandemic — the health care shortcomings, the thin financial cushion on which so many Americans are living — that’s the stuff that Bernie Sanders has been saying forever. So I could also imagine a version of this where the pandemic strengthens Sanders’s candidacy, not weakens it. alex burns I think that’s really, really sharply put. But I do think people are processing this differently than they would process, for instance, a crash just of the financial sector. That if you saw an economic collapse in which people felt like the government was racing to contain a contagion from the financial industry, and that their lives were basically safe, I suspect that we might be having a different political debate right now. And that you would see Bernie Sanders holding these enormous rallies and making exactly the case you just laid out. And I think that things are so turbulent and unpredictable right now that we can’t totally rule out the possibility that maybe that happens at some point once people see the scale of economic damage and the kind of vividness that we certainly and unfortunately will. What we have right now, though, is people who are experiencing a terrifying disruption in their daily lives. They’re experiencing it yes, as an economic crisis, but also as a public health crisis, and something that probably feels to a lot of people like a national security crisis. And while a lot of Sanders’s themes and ideas about the economy will probably be a bigger part of the conversation in the coming months, I don’t know that the country has reached that point yet. michael barbaro So I want to turn now to the practical question of how the rest of the Democratic primary unfolds. Because the situation we’re in hasn’t just frozen the dynamics of the race, it also seems to have actually frozen the mechanics of the campaign. Which feels pretty tricky because people have to leave their homes and go vote in order for there to ever be a nominee. So how is that going to work? alex burns Well, the short answer is we still don’t really know. Almost every day now, we hear from another state that is delaying its primary well into May or even into June. Now, some of the relevance of those changes is going to depend on what Bernie Sanders does next. If Sanders does stick around, and if Biden is not able to functionally unify the Democratic Party, with or without Bernie Sanders’s support, then we could see this really weird long period of dormancy in the campaign followed by a sudden frenzy of activity again in the late spring when maybe the virus will be more under control, and maybe people will start voting again. Personally right now, I think that that is an unlikely scenario. michael barbaro Alex, what’s your understanding of how Bernie Sanders is thinking of the big and difficult question of how long to stay in the race if it doesn’t really seem as a practical path to the nomination? He’s certainly hearing lots of calls to step aside in a moment of crisis, kind of let the party coalesce around a nominee and prepare itself for a general election. alex burns I think there are a couple things about the mindset of the Sanders’s camp right now that are really worth emphasizing here. One is that this is a group that not that long ago thought that they were on, not a glide path, but a pretty convincing course to the nomination. And they saw it fall away with astonishing speed. So there’s a level, I think, still of kind of shell shock, at feeling like they had this, or they were close to having this. And then it was yanked away from them. That’s a hard thing for a campaign, and especially, for a candidate to process. I think the conditions of the pandemic also make it harder for, well, anybody involved in the race at this point to think through, what is the right thing to do next? What we know about Bernie Sanders is that he cares a great deal about his agenda. And we also know that, as a personal matter, he likes Joe Biden. This is not the Sanders-Clinton rivalry. He doesn’t feel that the party really conspired to kneecap him in this race in the way that he did, with some justification, in 2016. So what you see here is a candidate, Sanders, who I think understands what an underdog he is right now, and an opponent in Biden, who is a negotiator. And I think that’s why you’re seeing Biden make such explicit overtures to Sanders supporters. archived recording (joe biden) Tonight in keeping with the latest guidance from the CDC, I’m speaking to you from my home in Wilmington, Delaware — alex burns That in the last two primary nights that we’ll have for a while, he has in his election night remarks, addressed himself to Sanders supporters — archived recording (joe biden) So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. alex burns — saying that he admires their enthusiasm and their ideas. archived recording (joe biden) Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. And together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country. alex burns He gave them credit for having fundamentally changed the framework of American politics. And he, specifically addressing young people, said — archived recording (joe biden) Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics. But we share a common vision for the need to provide affordable health care for all Americans, reduce income inequity that has risen so drastically, to tackling the existential threat of our time, climate change. alex burns — he understands the gravity of the challenges that they feel in their lives. When Biden takes those steps, it’s a clear signal that he’s trying to show Bernie Sanders that he has respect for the movement that he’s built. archived recording (joe biden) We have to step up and care for one another. Thank you all. Thank you all for listening. michael barbaro Finally, Alex, if Joe Biden is becoming a kind of de facto nominee over the next few weeks during this dormancy in the campaign, and if it starts to feel like a general election is getting underway between Biden and President Trump, I wonder what this really unique set of circumstances — which has meant so much for the Democratic primary — is going to mean for Biden’s potential challenger, the sitting president, Donald Trump. alex burns We know that the president is not going to be able to run for re-election on a message that happy days are here again, and there is nothing but prosperity as far as we can see. That message is gone. What we don’t know is what kind of story he will be able to tell about managing this crisis. We just don’t know what the conditions on the ground are going to be like in a couple of months, let alone in the general election. When this crisis hit, Joe Biden had a pretty solid advantage over the president in general election polls. The map just feels to me like it’s really up for grabs right now, because we’ve never conducted an election under these kinds of conditions. And even 2008, the election in the middle of a financial crisis, we hadn’t had the kind of time that we are going to have now to process the meaning of the setbacks that the country is currently experiencing. [music] michael barbaro It’s interesting you mentioned 2008 because it feels to me that that race might be the proper analogy, a crisis. And as you’ve said throughout this conversation, Democrats are starting to view Joe Biden as the candidate of crisis. I’m sure Republicans view President Trump as the candidate of crisis. And the question will become, once this crisis is over, what the general electorate views as the candidate of the crisis, who handled the crisis well and who would get us out of the crisis best. alex burns And is there a candidate they blame for the crisis? If people ultimately see the president as having let them down in this, that feels awfully hard to escape. As it is, we can’t say that that’s how the country is going to feel. But we can say that he was an unpopular president on the day this crisis started. And that it’s certainly not, based on what we know now, changing that picture in his favor. [music] michael barbaro Alex, thank you very much. alex burns Thank you. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. [music] michael barbaro Here’s what else you need to know today. Over the weekend, global efforts to contain the coronavirus by restricting people’s movements intensified. Australia ordered most public spaces closed. India said it was shutting down all but essential services in its capital, Delhi. Germany limited gatherings to no more than two people. Britain ordered 1.5 million people with serious medical problems to self-quarantine. And Lebanon called in the army to endorse a lockdown. archived recording (mike dewine) We are certainly at war.

0~U.K. Reaches Brexit Transition Deal With E.U.~LONDON — British and European Union negotiators on Monday agreed on the terms of a 21-month transition period to keep Britain inside Europe’s economic structures and to avoid an economically damaging “cliff edge” when the country formally departs the bloc next March. The transition accord was announced on Monday at a news conference in Brussels by David Davis, Britain’s main negotiator, and his European Union counterpart, Michel Barnier, who described it as a “decisive step” toward an orderly withdrawal, or Brexit. The deal, however, depends on a broader agreement on Britain’s withdrawal, which is to be finalized this year but is by no means certain. One of the main sticking points in those talks has been the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union. To achieve the transition accord, the British government retreated from an earlier pledge and conceded that European Union citizens who arrived in Britain during the transition period would have the same rights as those already in the country. (Earlier this year, Prime Minister Theresa May insisted that the rights of those newcomers would be “different.”)
0~Trump Mocks Warren as ‘Pocahontas’ at Navajo Veterans’ Event~WASHINGTON — President Trump on Monday transformed a White House ceremony to honor Navajo veterans of World War II into a racially charged controversy, using the event as a platform to deride Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.” Standing in the Oval Office alongside three Navajo code talkers, whom he called “very, very special people,” Mr. Trump dispensed with his prepared remarks and took aim at Ms. Warren without naming her, resurrecting a favorite nickname as the veterans stood stonefaced. “You were here long before any of us were here,” Mr. Trump said to the veterans, ages 90 and older, who wore their military uniforms for the occasion, juxtaposed with turquoise and silver, hallmarks of Navajo culture. “Although we have a representative in Congress who, they say, was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas.” He made the remarks while standing in front of a portrait of President Andrew Jackson — a favorite of Mr. Trump’s — who served as the nation’s seventh president and signed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which resulted in the mass displacement and deaths of Native Americans often referred to as the Trail of Tears.
0~Hurdles Frustrate Effort to Shrink Guantánamo~“Many countries just are not moving very quickly” to accept detainees, Sandra Hodgkinson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs said in an interview on Wednesday. “In some instances, they don’t want them back. In some instances, they are not willing to cooperate with us to find a solution to Guantánamo.” But critics say the United States has complicated the situation by making stringent demands about how the released detainees be handled. In the case of the British detainees, American officials wanted some of them to be jailed for a period of time and closely monitored upon release, including having their communications intercepted, according to documents in a lawsuit in England. In some instances, detainees have been quickly freed by their home countries and have become public figures, adding to the chorus of criticism about Guantánamo. In addition, the Pentagon has recently asserted that some 30 former such detainees have “returned to the fight,” including one who blew himself up last month as Pakistani forces closed in on him. Practical considerations have also made progress slow. The transfer of scores of Afghans has been delayed while a new prison has been readied for them in Afghanistan. “You can’t just ‘close Guantánamo,’ ” said Bobby Chesney, a national security law expert at Wake Forest University School of Law who has written about the legal issues involved in transfers. “It is a time-consuming and elaborate process, and I don’t see any reason why it is going to get quicker,” Mr. Chesney said. If and when the Pentagon reaches its stated goal of transferring as many as 150 detainees, the remaining Guantánamo population would fall into two categories, military officials said. They estimate that they might have sufficient evidence on as many as 80 to try them for war crimes.

0~India Blames Pakistan for Attack in Kashmir, Promising a Response~NEW DELHI — India accused Pakistan on Friday of orchestrating a suicide bombing that killed dozens of soldiers in Kashmir, the worst attack there in decades, promising an appropriate response and calling on world leaders to isolate its neighbor. Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack, in which at least 40 Indian soldiers were killed Thursday when a driver slammed an explosives-packed vehicle into a paramilitary convoy. But by Friday afternoon, India had recalled its ambassador to Pakistan for consultations in New Delhi. [On August 5, India revoked Kashmir’s special status.] With national elections in India set to take place by May and Prime Minister Narendra Modi facing a close contest, analysts say he risks looking weak if he does not respond. Mr. Modi was elected in 2014 on promises to crack down on Kashmir’s militants and to adopt a tougher line on Pakistan. The nuclear-armed rivals have gone to war three times since independence in 1947, with two of the wars fought over Kashmir. “We will give a befitting reply; our neighbor will not be allowed to destabilize us,” Mr. Modi said after an emergency meeting with security advisers on Friday, according to Reuters. “Our security forces are given full freedom” to respond, he added.
0~Tillerson, in Alaska, Gives No Hint on Paris Climate Accord~FAIRBANKS, Alaska — Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said on Thursday that the United States would “continue to be vigilant” in protecting the Arctic, a region that is undergoing rapid change linked to global warming. But he gave no signal as to whether his government would remain in the Paris climate accord, the international agreement that would go furthest in ensuring that protection. Mr. Tillerson, speaking at a meeting of the Arctic Council that marked the end of the United States’ two-year chairmanship of the intergovernmental organization, reaffirmed that the United States would stay involved in Arctic issues, including safeguarding what he termed the region’s “fragile environment.” He also signed, along with his counterparts from Russia, Canada and the five other nations with Arctic territory, a closing statement that mentioned the impacts of climate change on the region and took note of the Paris agreement. But Mr. Tillerson was noncommittal in addressing the Trump administration’s views on the Paris accord, in which the United States and most other nations have pledged to reduce carbon emissions with a goal of keeping global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius.
0~Kamala Harris Makes the Case That Joe Biden Should Pass That Torch to Her~“Senator Sanders —” “We need a political revolution.” “Repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent.” “If we had a value-added tax, even half the European level —” “If we turn toward socialism, we run the risk of helping to re-elect the worst president in American history.” “There need not be disagreement in the party, because in truth we want healthy capitalism.” “Joe Biden was right when he said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of Americans, 32 years ago.” “I’m still holding on to that torch.” “The fact that somebody has a younger body doesn’t mean you don’t have old ideas.” “I would like to speak on the issue of race. Vice President Biden, I do not believe you are a racist. But I also believe — and it is personal — and I was actually very, it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. You know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. And she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” “Look, everything I’ve done in my career — I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights —” “My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting: a black man, Eric Logan, killed by a white officer. This will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved.” “But you’re the mayor. You should fire the chief if that’s the policy and someone died.” “People who have health care under Medicare for all will have no premiums, no deductables, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care.” “The quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare.” “I would call it ‘Medicare for all who want it.’” “On Day 1, we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that Trump has done.” “I will release children from cages.” “When I see these kids at the border, I see my mom. She was separated from her parents for years during the Holocaust.” “To take children from the arms of their parents —” “This is collective child abuse.” “— actually put them up for adoption —” “Families always belong together.” “— in Colorado, we call that kidnapping.” “The first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump.” “We expose him for the fraud that he is.” “He’s torn apart the moral fabric of who we are.” “That is not reflective of our America and our values. And it’s got to end.” “But if you think we’re going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you got another thing coming. Because he didn’t win by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying, ‘Make America Great Again.’”
0~Bernie Sanders, at Fox News Town Hall, Says His Wealth Isn’t the ‘American Dream’~Shortly after he disclosed his tax returns for the last 10 years, Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday rejected the idea that his newfound millionaire status was a testament to capitalism and the “American dream.” Appearing on Fox News in a town-hall style event, Mr. Sanders defended his wealth as the honestly earned result of a popular book that he wrote. “If anybody thinks I should apologize for writing a best-selling book,” he said, “I’m not going to do it.” But he did not directly answer the question, asked by an audience member, about whether he himself should pay more in taxes now that he is a member of the “1 percent,” from whom he has spent years calling for greater contributions.
0~Virus-Tracing Apps Are Rife With Problems. Governments Are Rushing to Fix Them.~In April, Norway released a smartphone app, Smittestopp or “stop infection,” that records users who come into close contact for more than 15 minutes and sends alerts if they have been exposed to the coronavirus. “We can all help stop the spread of infection and save lives,” Prime Minister Erna Solberg said in a statement at the time. “If many people download the Smittestopp app, we can open up society more and get our freedom back.” Within two weeks, nearly 900,000 people — or about one out of five Norwegians older than 16 — had started using the app. But by mid-June, the government had temporarily turned off the service after data protection regulators there said Norway had so few coronavirus cases that the risks of intensified surveillance outweighed the app’s as yet unproven public health benefits. This week, the country’s data watchdog formally imposed an interim ban on the app.
0~Tech Magnates Bet on Booker and His Future~A graduate of Stanford, Mr. Booker has nurtured close ties to Silicon Valley: he amassed more than $400,000 in campaign contributions from tech executives and employees for his 2010 mayoral re-election and nearly $700,000 this year for his Senate bid, an analysis of state and federal campaign finance records shows. This spring, the widow of Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs, and the power couple Marc Andreessen and Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen held a fund-raiser for him. And as a social media enthusiast, with more than 30,000 Twitter posts, Mr. Booker has cast himself as an ambassador between the high-tech world and his beleaguered city. His aides noted that he had leveraged his relationships to Newark’s benefit, including a pledge of $100 million to the city’s schools from Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder. It was during a fund-raising swing in Silicon Valley in 2009, when Mr. Booker was soliciting campaign contributions from Ms. Powell Jobs and the venture capitalists Ted Schlein and Fredric Harman, that the visit to LinkedIn headquarters was arranged. In attendance at the gathering were Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, and its co-founder, Reid Hoffman (both of whom later invested in Waywire) along with John Ham of Ustream, the live-video service (Mr. Ham is now on Waywire’s advisory board), and Sarah Ross, the marketing wizard behind Ashton Kutcher’s record-setting Twitter following, who would become a principal in Waywire. Ms. Ross suggested in an interview that she saw in Mr. Booker a kindred social media spirit. She said she has wondered how the civil rights movement might have been different had the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had access to Twitter. “Social media is a movement,” she said, “and Cory Booker is a leader in this movement.” In 2011, Ms. Ross was approached by a friend, Nathan Richardson, an Internet executive who was thinking of starting a new company, to talk about the future of social media. In January 2012, she arranged for Mr. Richardson to join her and Mr. Booker at the Andros Diner in Newark. Mr. Booker had concerns about “marginalized voices” getting lost in the ocean that is YouTube, he said. “I see high school kids who are doing incredible videos,” he said, “but their voices are not breaking into the national conversation.” The idea of a company soon came together among the three. Mr. Booker recalled how Ms. Ross pressed him to sign on: “‘You know what? You should do it, found the company. Obviously you don’t have to be involved — you’ve got a full-time job. But found the company.’ ”
0~Five Takeaways From President-Elect Biden’s Victory Speech~Joseph R. Biden Jr. waited a long time to give the speech he delivered in Delaware on Saturday night. Not just the five days since Election Day, but arguably the 48 years since he was first elected to the Senate, during which he ran for president three times. And at age 77, as Mr. Biden came trotting up the runway to an explosion of car horns and cheers, beaming and looking almost surprised by the ovation, it was clear that his moment had arrived. Here are five takeaways from the president-elect’s victory speech. A new tone from the top. The contrast between Mr. Biden and President Trump was bracing and notable in almost every passage, as the president-elect invoked his own spirituality and shared credit for the moment with his supporters and the people around him. He quoted from a hymn, “On Eagle’s Wings.” He thanked his supporters: “I owe you, I owe you, I owe you everything.” He warmly praised Kamala Harris, his running mate, and celebrated the fact that she would be the first woman, let alone woman of color, to serve as vice president: “It’s long overdue, and we’re reminded tonight of all those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen.” Most of all, even as the nation faces one of the darkest periods in its history — a deadly pandemic, economic decline, political polarization — Mr. Biden was relentlessly optimistic, even cheerful. “We can do it,” he said. “I know we can.”
0~Mudslinging at Balenciaga~PARIS — We live in a dirty, dirty world. A world where muckraking, mudslinging and drain-the-swamp chanting are just part of daily life. Little wonder Demna, the mononymous designer of Balenciaga and master of the visual metaphor, decided to get down into the pit and wallow. To be specific: He decided to truck in 275 cubic meters (more than 9,700 cubic feet) of black mud harvested from a French peat bog and dump it in the middle of a convention center on the outskirts of Paris. It was smooshed onto the walls, sliding down the sides of an enormous trough, and dug into a shallow catwalk along the edge, seeping with water, all courtesy of the Spanish artist Santiago Sierra. The air was pungent with a moist eau de peat (a special scent had been created to enhance the smell of decomposition), and slime was oozing across the aisles. Guests picked their way carefully to their seats, terrified of wiping out. The set was, Demna wrote in his show notes, about “digging for the truth and being down to earth.” If that requires getting your hands (and feet and clothes) gunked-up, so be it. While his couture has become his experiment with Balenciaga’s legacy, the ready-to-wear has become his means of social commentary. It isn’t pretty out there. His mud club wasn’t either.
0~Sergei Skripal Was Retired, but Still in the Spy Game. Is That Why He Was Poisoned?~Officials were more circumspect about Mr. Skripal’s visit to Estonia, with one describing it as “very sensitive information.” A senior European official with knowledge of the trip confirmed that the former Russian agent met secretly with a select group of intelligence officers in June 2016, though it is not clear what they discussed. The British intelligence services helped facilitate the meeting, the official said. A spokesman for the British Home Office also declined to comment. Mr. Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found semiconscious on a park bench in the British town of Salisbury on March 4. Officials later determined that they had been poisoned with novichok, a deadly nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union. The British government has accused Russia of manufacturing and stockpiling the agent, as well as training “special units” to employ it against Russia’s enemies. Russia has aggressively denied any involvement and has lampooned the British investigation. But Mr. Skripal would certainly still have enemies in Russia, not least of all President Vladimir V. Putin, who has said he is incapable of forgiving betrayal. In 2006, a Russian military court convicted Mr. Skripal of selling out fellow Russian spies in exchange for payments from British agents. He was serving a 13-year sentence when he was unexpectedly sent to Britain in the 2010 spy swap. Russia’s relations with Estonia and the Czech Republic, two former Communist Bloc countries, are freighted with the legacy of the Cold War. Estonia in particular moved aggressively to assert its independence after breaking with the Soviet Union in 1991, often provoking Russian ire. Ferreting out Russian spies is a source of national pride. “Estonia has the best counterintelligence in Europe,” said Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was Estonia’s president for a decade and left office in 2016. “We’ve caught as many spies as Germany.” Nothing about Mr. Skripal’s travels appears all that uncommon. John Sipher, who retired from the Central Intelligence Agency in 2014 and once ran covert operations against the Russians, said the United States routinely deployed Russian defectors to lecture the intelligence services of its allies, though their meetings with other agencies would be kept secret to avoid angering Moscow. “There is a bit of a game where, O.K., the guy spied for us, we got what we wanted, and now that we’re out, we’re not going to rub your nose in it,” he said.
0~Russian Campaign Promotes Homegrown Vaccine and Undercuts Rivals~Intelligence officials in the United States noticed the first uptick in Russia targeting Spanish-speaking communities in August, when President Vladimir V. Putin announced that he had granted approval to Sputnik V. Since then, Russia’s campaign has intensified, said two intelligence officials who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with reporters. The State Department officials described Russia’s influence campaign as a combination of Russia’s state-backed media outlets highlighting reports that warned about the dangers of the U.S. vaccines, while promoting any reports that were enthusiastic about the Russian-made vaccine. At the State Department, a report circulated last month outlining Russia’s efforts, according to the officials. A department spokeswoman said Russia had tried to promote its own vaccine while “seeking to sow distrust” in the United States about Western vaccines. Analyzing over 1,000 Russian-aligned Twitter accounts, the State Department’s Global Engagement Center found that Spanish-language accounts showed the greatest engagement. Russia’s campaign, the spokeswoman said, “undermines the collective global effort to end the global pandemic.” The influence campaign in Mexico has become the best understood of the efforts by the outlets with ties to the Kremlin. It was different from previous Russian disinformation campaigns, which leaned on posting false and misleading information online. As social media companies have become more aggressive in rooting out disinformation, Russian operations have focused on promoting selective news stories that skirt the truth, rather than reject it. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. The new approach was particularly effective because the Spanish-language Twitter and Facebook accounts of Russia Today and Sputnik, two state-controlled media outlets, regularly rank among the most influential in Latin America, said researchers at First Draft. “They have cultivated a large audience and regularly rank in the top 10 of the most-shared stories or links,” Mr. Longoria said. In a statement, Russia Today said: “RT stories referenced represent a cherry-picked fraction of our coverage, and have been reported on by many other news outlets as well. Although The Times frames them as a part of a ‘disinformation’ campaign, nowhere does it point to any errors, inaccuracies or falsehoods in these stories, therefore baselessly tainting RT news coverage.” Sputnik did not respond to a request for comment.
0~Why Many Police Traffic Stops Turn Deadly~Trainers and tactical guides typically emphasize that vehicle stops account for more killings of officers than almost any other type of interaction. Of the roughly 280 officers killed on duty since late 2016, about 60 died — mostly by gunfire — at the hands of motorists who had been pulled over, a Times analysis showed. (About 170 other officers died in accidents on the job.) But the assertions about the heightened danger ignore the context: Vehicle stops far outnumber every other kind of police dealings with civilians. In fact, because the police pull over so many cars and trucks — tens of millions each year — an officer’s chances of being killed at any vehicle stop are less than 1 in 3.6 million, excluding accidents, two studies have shown. At stops for common traffic infractions, the odds are as low as 1 in 6.5 million, according to a 2019 study by Jordan Blair Woods, a law professor at the University of Arkansas. “The risk is statistically negligible, but nonetheless it is existentially amplified,” said Mr. Gill, the Salt Lake County district attorney and an outspoken proponent of increased police accountability. State laws generally prohibit police officers from using lethal force unless they reasonably believe it necessary to prevent imminent death or serious injury. Under pressure from street protests over the 2014 killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., and the more recent Black Lives Matter marches, many police departments have made de-escalation their watchword. They often advise officers to defuse conflict with motorists, for example by listening attentively instead of just barking orders. “The last thing I need to try to do is exert my authority, like ‘You’re going to do what I tell you to do because I said so,’” said Jon Blum, a former police officer who now writes training materials for police agencies and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “What the officer has to do is sell the person.” Departments have increasingly instructed officers to let suspected lawbreakers drive away and find them later, avoiding the risks of potential confrontation or a high-speed pursuit. “You have the guy’s car license plate and you know where he lives,” said Scott Bieber, the chief of police in Walla Walla, Wash. “You go get him in 45 minutes at his house and add a charge of eluding.”

0~A Relationship Where Marriage is Freedom~Their differences melted away on the dance floor. When Mr. Florke wrote his number on a napkin, Mr. Maloney put it in his wallet. He kept it there for 20 years. Mr. Florke, 51, and Mr. Maloney, 47, who was elected in 2012 as New York’s first openly gay congressman, were married last month at a church near their home in Cold Spring, N.Y., as their three children looked on. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, gave a toast. Joan Osborne, the pop singer, crooned a ballad for their first dance. It was a moment that neither could have predicted from that night at the Roxy, when Mr. Florke, heartbroken from losing a longtime partner, was only seeking a casual fling; when Mr. Maloney, about to start work at a white-shoe law firm, was still wondering, and worrying, about what it would be like to date a man. Each had arrived in Manhattan via very different paths. The son of an Iowa farmer, Mr. Florke came out when he was young and moved to New York at 18, enrolling in a fashion course. Mr. Maloney was the youngest of six children in a staunch Catholic family and attended elite schools, where he dated women. “I was so dramatically different from the world that he had come from,” Mr. Florke said. But at the time, it suited him: “He was just coming out of the closet. I thought it was perfect, because he wouldn’t be looking to have a relationship.”
0~BNP Paribas Guilty Plea Is Latest Big Settlement to Bolster New York State’s Fiscal Position~It is payback in a way. New York was hit hard by the financial crisis, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. In 2008 alone, cash bonuses paid by Wall Street firms to employees in New York City fell 44 percent, according to the New York State comptroller’s office, as firms notched record losses and one big firm, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy. Job losses, cuts in compensation and bankruptcies all translate into less tax money for the state. The crisis spawned dozens of regulatory investigations, which took several years to come to fruition. While the BNP Paribas case is not related to misdeeds committed during the financial crisis, a number of the recent big settlements are. For instance, in 2013, the state’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, received $613 million as part of a national settlement with JPMorgan Chase centering on its sale of troubled mortgage securities to investors in the run-up to the crisis. Damien LaVera, a spokesman for the attorney general, said that in 2013 his office recovered $1.78 billion in settlements, of which $440.2 million went to victims’ groups and the rest to the state, be it general funds, repayments to Medicaid or areas earmarked in settlements. This is up from the $1.5 billion the attorney general collected in settlement money in 2012. That year, $481.5 million went to victims’ groups and the rest went to the state. The Financial Services Department, which is led by Benjamin M. Lawsky and whose duties include regulating overseas banks with offices in New York, has collected roughly $3.7 billion since 2012. That includes the $2.2 billion this week. Money collected by the agency goes directly to the state’s general fund. The state attorney general has previously tried to hang on to settlement money, hoping to allocate it to different programs. But this has not been without controversy. When Mr. Schneiderman collected the $613 million from JPMorgan, his office and the bank negotiated the terms so that the attorney general would be given sole discretion over how to allocate the money. Mr. Schneiderman had plans for the cash, including preventing avoidable foreclosures and expanding his office’s efforts to fight financial fraud.
0~Losing Water, California Tries to Stay Atop Economic Wave~While state authorities can set some requirements on how things get built — such as recent restrictions on the size of lawns permitted for new homes, and a law requiring developers of projects of more than 500 homes to demonstrate where they will get water — decisions on land use are left largely to local city councils and planning commissions. And water consumption is not necessarily the first concern of local officials as they approve grand 25-year development plans, with their promises of jobs and tax revenues. “It’s very hard to be a local elected official and say no,” said Max Gomberg, the senior environmental scientist for climate change with the State Water Resources Control Board, the agency with primary responsibility for regulating the water supply. “All the reasons to say yes are very powerful, starting with tax revenues. And of course, the self-interest of wanting to be re-elected.” Bullet Train to Nowhere : Construction of the California high-speed rail system, America’s most ambitious infrastructure project, Construction of the California high-speed rail system, America’s most ambitious infrastructure project, has become a multi-billion-dollar nightmare A Piece of Black History Destroyed: Lincoln Heights — a historically Black community in a predominantly white, rural county in Northern California — endured for decades.

In Newport Beach, where seawater often seeps into the groundwater, a project to build more than 1,300 new homes has won approval from the City Council and is now before the California Coastal Commission. Across the Coachella Valley, an inland stretch of Southern California dotted with oases of affluence, local planning officials are weighing applications for development in the desert, including 7,800 new homes approved by the city of Coachella last summer, even as authorities warn of continuing declines in the aquifer and in the Colorado River, which provide water to these communities. California has a population of about 38 million; it is projected to hit just under 50 million by 2050. Folsom officials describe the expansion here as the kind of well-planned development that has characterized their trim and attractive city since it was founded in 1856. “Housing doesn’t create growth — people create growth,” Mr. Palmer, the city manager, said. “It’s happening all over California. When you are in the city business, you accommodate market factors.” Mr. Palmer noted that Folsom was not now using its entire allocation from the lake, and said that he was confident there would be enough water to supply the future development on the books.
0~Poll Shows Trump Dragging Down G.O.P. Senate Candidates~Taken together, the three battleground states paint a grim picture for Republicans right now — and suggest that if Mr. Trump does not arrest his fall he could hand Democrats control of both the presidency and the Senate next year. “The election is a referendum on Trump,” said Kirk Adams, a Republican and former Arizona state House speaker. “That could change, but until then, down-ballot Republicans will have to decide if they will ride the Trump train to its final destination or if they need to establish some brand independence.” Jill Cohen, a 52-year-old resident of Tempe, Ariz, who was a Republican until 2016, said she would have a difficult time supporting a Senate candidate who “aligns herself” with Mr. Trump and his views. “I look to a leader of our country to be someone who is unifying, who is welcoming, who is inclusive and who I can tell my children to look up to,” she said. Mr. Trump, she added, “is not any of those things.” She said she longed for more consensus-oriented lawmakers and would vote for Mr. Kelly. “I really like Kyrsten Sinema for that reason because she is willing to go across the aisle and work bipartisan,” she said, referring to Arizona’s other senator. “And I think Kelly would, too.” The margin of sampling error in the Times/Siena survey for the individual state polls in Arizona, Michigan and North Carolina is about four percentage points. The Times survey of battleground states is not the only recent polling that illustrates how the president’s unpopularity is endangering his party’s candidates. A recent Des Moines Register poll in Iowa — which found Mr. Trump up by just one percentage point in a state he carried by about 10 in 2016 — showed Senator Joni Ernst trailing by three points against Theresa Greenfield, a first-time candidate. Republicans have a 53-47 Senate majority. A pickup of three seats would give Democrats control, if Mr. Biden wins and his vice president is able to break a 50-50 tie. But if Doug Jones of Alabama, a rare Democratic senator in the Deep South, loses his re-election in a state that Mr. Trump is expected to comfortably carry, Democrats would need to pick up four seats to take control.
0~Trump and Clinton Tied in Final Upshot Poll of North Carolina~North Carolina could decide both the presidency and control of the Senate, so it’s a good thing that it counts its vote quickly on election night. It might need to count all of them before we know the results up and down the ballot. It’s that close. Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are tied in the state, 44 percent to 44 percent, in the final New York Times Upshot/Siena College survey released Monday. The Republican senator Richard Burr narrowly leads his Democratic challenger, Deborah Ross, 46 percent to 45 percent.
0~Joe Biden Said He Did Not View Abortion ‘As a Choice and a Right’ in 2006~In a newly unearthed video from 2006, Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he supported Roe v. Wade but did not view abortion as “a choice and a right” — remarks that raise further questions about how he views abortion rights as he runs for the Democratic presidential nomination and faces pressure over his position on the issue. “I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it’s always a tragedy,” Mr. Biden said in a videotaped interview with Texas Monthly, resurfaced on Thursday by CNN. “I think it should be rare and safe,” he added. “I think we should be focusing on how to limit the number of abortions.” Mr. Biden referred to himself as a “little bit of an odd man out in my party” because he wouldn’t vote for federal financing of abortions, had voted to limit late-term abortions, but supported Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the legal right to the procedure.

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but you have options As the Intelligence Committee chairman, Mr. Burr receives regular briefings on threats to the United States, including the coronavirus. He is also a member of the Senate health committee, which in January hosted a briefing with top Trump administration officials open to all senators. It is apparently not the first time Mr. Burr has acted decisively to shield his assets from financial turmoil after hearing from government officials. In 2009, he recounted in a speech how after he heard Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson discuss a major company’s difficulty moving money between banks, he called his wife and instructed her to withdraw as much cash as possible from their own accounts out of fear there would be a run on funds. Three other senators also sold major holdings around the time Mr. Burr did, according to the disclosure records: Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who is also a member of the Intelligence Committee; James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma; and Kelly Loeffler, Republican of Georgia. The record of Mr. Burr’s stock transaction shows he and his wife sold 33 different stocks on Feb. 13 that were collectively worth $628,000 to $1.7 million, according to the disclosures filed with the secretary of the Senate. Those sales include as much as $150,000 worth of stock in two hotel chains, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts and Extended Stay America. The values of both companies have declined significantly in recent weeks. He also sold as much as $65,000 worth of stock in Park Hotels & Resorts. Ms. Feinstein and her husband sold $1.5 million to $6 million worth of stock in Allogene Therapeutics, a California-based biotech company, in transactions that took place on Jan. 31 and Feb. 18. Mr. Inhofe sold a large amount of stock — all on Jan. 27 — including holdings in PayPal, Apple and Brookfield Asset Management, a real estate company, with the overall value of the sales totaling as much as $400,000, a disclosure report shows.
0~Discovery to Buy Scripps, Owner of Food Network, in $11.9 Billion Deal~“This shotgun marriage is a clear sign that the cable network industry has seen the future, and that future requires deep cost cutting and increased scale to mitigate both the current headwinds and the inevitable painful changes that lie ahead,” Mr. Nathanson wrote in a research note. “Without any material improvement to current ratings and subscriber trends, the timing and cost for Discovery to double down in the U.S. will likely look foolish in hindsight.” The Discovery-Scripps deal has been in the works for a long time. About nine years ago, Discovery approached Scripps about a potential deal, Mr. Zaslav said. But the Scripps family’s shareholders, who control roughly 92 percent of the broadcaster’s voting stock — and who vote as a group — were not yet ready to sell. In 2014, the companies started talking again, but those discussions fell apart over a range of issues, including price. Discovery shifted gears and focused on expanding its international footprint, making deals to buy Eurosport, SBS Nordic and other programming rights. All the while, Mr. Zaslav stayed close with Kenneth W. Lowe, the chief executive of Scripps Networks Interactive. The two men have been friends for nearly 30 years, sneaking away from industry conferences for steak dinners, and they have gone on vacations with their wives together, including a trip to Rome a few months ago. Both men were inducted into the Cable Hall of Fame in April. It was about six weeks ago that Mr. Zaslav decided that Discovery should take another look at Scripps after a meeting with his head of content for Latin America. The executive asked Mr. Zaslav if he knew Mr. Lowe, explaining how a deal to distribute Scripps programming across Discovery’s Home & Health network in that region was providing a significant boost and that they could use more. The next morning, Scripps came up again during a discussion Mr. Zaslav was having with Group Nine, the digital media company in which Discovery invested $100 million. Mr. Zaslav asked about the Tastemade video network, which led to a discussion about Scripps’s significant presence in the food category on emerging services like Snapchat’s Discover.
0~A Rare Look Inside the Hospital Where 15 Coronavirus Patients Have Died~Unlike at any other hospital in the United States, the staff members at the hospital in Kirkland, Wash., have faced the brunt of the rapidly escalating coronavirus outbreak. So far, 65 people who have come through the hospital have tested positive for the virus, a number that grows by the day. Fifteen of them have died, mostly residents of a nearby nursing home devastated by the illness and half the nation’s death toll. While much of the country is just starting to see clusters of cases emerge, the hospital east of Seattle offers a window into the challenges set to cascade through the nation’s health care system, testing the resilience of workers, the readiness of institutions and the flexibility of supply chains. The past few weeks have seen medical workers operating at the very edges of their capabilities, facing a virus so virulent that some patients were dying within hours of coming down with their first symptoms. Caregivers who had been sent home into quarantine had to be called back to work to face the overwhelming task at hand. Engineers spent late nights scrambling to overhaul rooms so that contaminated air could not escape. Sanitation and janitorial crews struggled to swab down rooms where even a trace of the virus could infect the next patient. Supplies were so strained that nurses turned to menstrual pads to buttress the padding in their helmets.
0~What Is SWIFT and Why Does It Matter for Russia?~President Biden said on Thursday that the United States and Europe were united in their efforts to confront Russian aggression toward Ukraine with aggressive sanctions. However, there was one area where he suggested disagreement: SWIFT. The Belgian messaging service, formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, connects more than 11,000 financial institutions around the world. It is viewed as a potential nuclear option in the world of sanctions because, if Russia was kicked off SWIFT, the nation would essentially be severed from much of the global financial system. But doing so would not be simple and could come with its own set of costly complications for countries outside Russia, many of which are dependent on the country for energy, wheat and other commodities. That has made some nations skittish about pulling the trigger. SWIFT is a global cooperative of financial institutions that began in 1973 when 239 banks from 15 countries got together to figure out how to best handle cross-border payments. It does not actually hold or transfer funds, but it allows banks and other financial companies to alert one another of transactions that are about to take place.
0~Trump Calls Some Unauthorized Immigrants ‘Animals’ in Rant~WASHINGTON — President Trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a White House meeting on Wednesday, warning in front of news cameras that dangerous people were clamoring to breach the country’s borders and branding such people “animals.” Mr. Trump’s comments came during a round-table discussion with state and local leaders on California’s so-called sanctuary laws, which strictly limit communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, and which the Trump administration is suing to invalidate. It was hardly the first time the president has spoken in racially fraught terms about immigrants, but it underscored his anger about unchecked immigration — the animating issue of his campaign and his tenure so far — and his frustration that he has not been able to do more to seal the nation’s borders. As he has in numerous private meetings with his advisers at the White House, Mr. Trump used the session to vent about the nation’s immigration laws, calling them “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world.” He exhorted his administration to “do much better” in keeping out undesirable people, including members of transnational gangs like MS-13. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we’re stopping a lot of them,” Mr. Trump said in the Cabinet Room during an hourlong meeting that reporters were allowed to document. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people, these are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.”
0~Snap Moving to I.P.O. Faster Than Its Peers~Snap wants to be sure youth is not wasted on the young. The company, which offers an app with disappearing messages and pictures, is preparing an initial public offering at the tender age of five years. That is earlier than most of its technologically minded peers, which tend to mature a little more before going public. Snap’s value, however, may yet have some growing to do. The start-up, formerly known as Snapchat, is based in Los Angeles and led by the 26-year-old Evan Spiegel. It submitted confidential I.P.O. paperwork this month under a law intended for smaller firms. A market debut early next year could get Snap trading ahead of highly anticipated stock sales by older ventures including Airbnb, Palantir, Pinterest and Uber. Figures discussed only privately so far are impressive. Snap has approximately 150 million daily active users, should generate over $350 million in revenue this year and hit $1 billion in 2017. If that is accurate, it would mean growth of nearly 200 percent. The mooted top-end valuation of $25 billion would then peg it at an eye-popping 25 times the expected top line. Both Twitter and Facebook were expanding at about the same rate when they were the same age. Twitter would have had only about 50 million comparable users, an estimate calculated by using the proportion of monthly-to-daily users it reported at the time of its I.P.O. two years later. And yet it garnered a valuation, privately, of 25 times revenue. Growing pains have cut the microblogging site to less than five times next year’s revenue.
0~Vaccine Rollout Gives U.K. a Rare Win in the Pandemic~The divergence between Britain and its European neighbors has prompted some to claim an early windfall from Brexit. Britain’s divorce from the European Union helped give it the political leeway to authorize multiple vaccines before the bloc and to swiftly lock up its own production of the vaccine from AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. France, by contrast, has vaccinated only 1.8 percent of its population and Germany 2.6 percent, according to numbers collected by Our World in Data. That reflects supply shortages that have rippled across the continent, as well as the slower pace of European Union regulators in approving vaccines. But Britain’s success is also a result of back-to-basics decisions by the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Rather than contracting out the campaign to private companies or building it from scratch, as it did with its costly, ineffective contact tracing operation, the government has put vaccination in the hands of the National Health Service, which despite financial strains is still widely revered by the British public. Beyond state hospitals, general practitioners are at the forefront of the program. Not only does that put trusted local doctors, who are experienced with seasonal flu inoculations, in charge, but it has also allowed these doctors to precisely target the people in the government’s highest priority groups. That is a stark contrast to the more fragmented approach in the United States. While people there have had to scramble for appointments on finicky online portals and overwhelmed telephone hotlines, British hospitals and physicians have directed the scheduling themselves, allowing them to begin with their oldest and most vulnerable patients.
0~American Consumers, Not China, Are Paying for Trump’s Tariffs~The authors of the latest study used customs data to trace the fallout, examining import values before and after the tariffs. The research showed that the tariffs had little impact on China. “We’re just not seeing foreigners bearing the cost, which to me is very surprising,” Professor Weinstein said in an interview. They also found a delayed impact from the tariffs, with the decline in some imports roughly doubling on average in the second year of the levies. That is because “it takes some time for firms to reorganize their supply chains so that they can avoid the tariffs,” the authors write. Reaction to the tariffs has varied across business sectors, however. In the steel industry, for example, companies that export to the United States have dropped their prices — suggesting that other countries are in fact paying “close to half” of the cost of tariffs, according to the paper. Because China is only the 10th-largest steel supplier to the United States, though, exporters in the European Union, Japan and South Korea are most likely bearing much of that cost. And as foreign prices drop, domestic steel production has barely budged, which bodes poorly for hiring in the United States steel industry, the authors note. “The steel industry isn’t getting that much protection, as a result,” Professor Weinstein said. In previous research, the authors found that by December 2018, import tariffs were costing United States consumers and importing businesses $3.2 billion per month in added taxes and another $1.4 billion per month in efficiency losses. They did not update those numbers in the latest study.
0~De Blasio Resisted on Coronavirus. Then Aides Said They’d Quit.~Mr. de Blasio said on Monday that he knew of no offer or threat to resign. “I know nothing about that. I know people have had serious conversations, trying to make citizens’ decisions together,” the mayor said at a news conference late Monday afternoon. “I know when someone comes up to me and says, ‘I want to resign,’ that has not happened.” “Does everyone agree on everything all the time? No. Are there different factors? Does health think the same way as education? Guess what? No,” the mayor added later. “They have different imperatives and we have to make sense of them for example, but no one threatened to resign. Period.” As fears over the coronavirus outbreak rose with each new reported case in New York City, Mr. de Blasio has tried to do his best to project a sense of calm. He stressed that the vast majority of people who contracted the virus in New York would recover after a mild illness. He also continued to travel from Gracie Mansion in Manhattan to work out at a Y.M.C.A. in Park Slope, Brooklyn, a longstanding routine that has garnered intense criticism. Even on Monday, hours before all gyms in New York had to close, the mayor was seen getting one last workout in at the Y — attracting a new furious round of criticism.
0~U.S. and Russia Reach Deal to Destroy Syria’s Chemical Arms~GENEVA — The United States and Russia reached a sweeping agreement on Saturday that called for Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons to be removed or destroyed by the middle of 2014 and indefinitely stalled the prospect of American airstrikes. The joint announcement, on the third day of intensive talks in Geneva, also set the stage for one of the most challenging undertakings in the history of arms control. “This situation has no precedent,” said Amy E. Smithson, an expert on chemical weapons at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. “They are cramming what would probably be five or six years’ worth of work into a period of several months, and they are undertaking this in an extremely difficult security environment due to the ongoing civil war.” Although the agreement explicitly includes the United Nations Security Council for the first time in determining possible international action in Syria, Russia has maintained its opposition to any military action.
0~‘Wrong Side of History’: In Queens, Amazon Deal’s Demise Reveals Deep Divisions~Shortly after news broke on Thursday that Amazon was abandoning its plans for a campus in Long Island City, Queens, local elected officials and activist groups who had opposed the deal held a celebratory rally near the site where the company had planned to build its new offices. But along with those cheering the deal’s demise, many hecklers from another faction appeared — those who supported Amazon coming to New York and blamed opponents for torpedoing a deal that would have brought sorely needed jobs and improvements to the community. “Where you gonna get the jobs?” one heckler shouted. [For the full story on Amazon’s decision to pull out of New York, read more here.] And so, as the Amazon news reverberated around New York City and beyond on Thursday, perhaps nowhere did it get a more divided reception than in Long Island City, the neighborhood that would have undergone the biggest transformation as a result of the deal.

At the rally on Saturday, he referred to several recent cases in which ballots have been misplaced or lost, including a handful of ballots in Pennsylvania. How Times reporters cover politics.

Shortly after announcing Judge Barrett’s nomination in a Rose Garden event on Saturday at the White House, Mr. Trump flew to the Harrisburg airport to speak to an outdoor crowd of perhaps a few thousand — far fewer than the “tens of thousands” he claimed from onstage. It was the latest of several rallies he has held in which his supporters packed together, mostly without face masks. Flanked by a huge television screen displaying the words “FILL THAT SEAT!” Mr. Trump used the announcement to whip up his supporters, eliciting roars of applause and chants of “U.S.A., US.A.,” when he predicted that Republicans in the Senate would quickly confirm Judge Barrett. “She will defend your God-given rights and freedoms,” Mr. Trump said, accusing Mr. Biden of refusing to provide the names of potential nominees to the Supreme Court because his “names will be handpicked by socialists.” Mr. Trump and his campaign are betting that the opportunity to cement a conservative majority on the court for decades to come will underscore for his supporters the need to return him to the Oval Office for another four years. But the president did not dwell exclusively on Judge Barrett. In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Mr. Trump railed against Mr. Biden and exaggerated his own record during his time in office.
0~‘Fortress of Solitude,’ Now With Musical Numbers, at the Public Theater~For a novel that featured a magic ring that allowed teenagers to fly and turn invisible, Jonathan Lethem’s “The Fortress of Solitude” felt uncannily true to life. This 2003 chronicle of a Jewish boy growing up in a largely African-American Brooklyn neighborhood understood that nothing is ever as simple as black and white. It’s appropriate that the R&B group that formed part of the soundtrack of the coming-of-age of Mr. Lethem’s ambivalent hero was called the Subtle Distinctions. Whether the subject was music, comic books, graffiti, absent parents or experimental sex, the fine differences in their forms — and our narrator’s painful consciousness of them — made the book an especially authentic-tasting brew. The Subtle Distinctions surface again in the big-hearted but thin-blooded musical adaptation of “The Fortress of Solitude,” which opened Wednesday night at the Public Theater. I’m referring exclusively to the musical quartet. Subtle distinctions, without the capital letters, are rarely in evidence in this production, which features a book by Itamar Moses and songs by Michael Friedman. Directed by Daniel Aukin, who also conceived the show, this “Fortress” operates mostly on an either-or binary system, as opposed to the more multistranded approach taken by Mr. Lethem. Parallels, contrasts and conflicts are laid out neatly. Such simplification is perhaps inevitable in translating the indirection of a 511-page novel into the show-and-tell shorthand of a standard-length musical. To its credit, the singing “Fortress” resourcefully juggles different time periods and cultures and characters of different ages without ever blurring those elements. But it does tend to remove their distinctive edges.
0~Trump Sexual Misconduct Accusations Repeated by Several Women~WASHINGTON — Several women who came forward during the 2016 campaign to accuse Donald J. Trump of sexual misconduct renewed their allegations publicly on Monday, betting that recently aggressive attitudes against harassment will give their stories new life and demanding that Congress investigate the president’s actions. The women said that they were frustrated that their stories about what they described as Mr. Trump’s actions did not have a greater effect on his campaign. But they also expressed hope that they would be taken more seriously after a torrent of similar accusations had toppled the careers of powerful men in the news media, business and politics. “Now it’s just like, ‘All right let’s try Round 2, the environment is different, let’s try again,’” Samantha Holvey, a former contestant in the Miss USA pageant, said Monday morning on the NBC program “Megyn Kelly Today.” She repeated her charge that Mr. Trump ogled her and other women in the pageant’s hair and makeup room. Ms. Holvey was joined by Jessica Leeds, who has said Mr. Trump groped and kissed her during a flight in the 1970s, and Rachel Crooks, who has accused Mr. Trump of repeatedly kissing her outside her office in Trump Tower. Lisa Boyne, a fourth accuser, joined the women at a news conference hosted by Brave New Films, a documentary film company.
0~Justice Dept. Seeks to Curb Illegal Gun Trafficking~CHICAGO — The Justice Department on Thursday began putting in place a plan to reduce violent crime in the nation’s largest cities, detailing the work of five federal strike forces aimed at disrupting illegal gun traffickers who flood urban streets with illicit firearms. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland traveled to Chicago, where one of the strike forces will be located, to highlight the plan and underscore the Biden administration’s efforts to curb the spread of illegal firearms. A Chicago police officer and two agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were shot while working undercover in the city this month. “The gun violence tragedy now facing the country, needless to say, affects our communities and our security and safety, but it also affects our law enforcement officers,” Mr. Garland said in remarks at A.T.F. headquarters in Washington before leaving for Chicago. He also appealed to lawmakers, who have not yet confirmed President Biden’s nominee to lead the bureau, David Chipman. “A.T.F. is on the front lines of our efforts to battle gun violence,” Mr. Garland said. “We are very hopeful that the Senate will soon act.”
0~For Unions and New York City Hall, an Open-Door Relationship Turns Complex~As what would become one of the most controversial deals of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration — the removal of deed restrictions on a Lower East Side nursing home — hung in the balance, the health care workers union, 1199 S.E.I.U., sought to exert its influence through a series of emails and text messages to the mayor’s top officials. The direct pipeline to City Hall was the kind of access that most unions could have only dreamed about; for two decades, successive mayors, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg, kept the city’s unions at more of an arm’s length. But in 2014, with the election of Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who counts those with union ties among his closest advisers, the door opened wide. Phone calls were returned. Concerns addressed. Contract disputes that languished under Mr. Bloomberg were resolved within months of Mr. de Blasio’s taking office. It was a new day for labor at City Hall. The good will went both ways. Early in Mr. de Blasio’s tenure, unions were among the biggest supporters of his political causes, including a nonprofit advocacy group for his issues and a failed bid in 2014 to push the State Senate to Democratic control. Three of the biggest unions — 1199, the American Federation of Teachers and Unite Here, which represents hospitality workers — gave a total of $1.25 million to the nonprofit, Campaign for One New York, before it closed early this year; labor unions gave nearly that much to the Senate bid in a fund-raising effort organized by de Blasio aides.

Instagram, the photo-sharing start-up he bought for $1 billion in 2012, has been valued at 100 times that figure by Bloomberg Intelligence. That, on paper at least, would mark an incredible return on investment. Back in April 2012, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive, drew a fair amount of criticism for the deal, which surprised both Silicon Valley and Wall Street. First, there was the timing of the deal. Facebook announced the acquisition roughly a month before its initial public offering.
0~New Spies Went for a Joyride in Moscow. Russia Isn’t Happy.~MOSCOW — Officers and recent graduates of Russia’s top security academy will be reprimanded or fired after a video circulated online showing them joyriding around Moscow in a parade of gleaming black luxury vehicles, the Federal Security Service said on Thursday. The agency, known as the F.S.B., said in an exceedingly rare statement that the incident had compromised its credibility in the eyes of the Russian public. The joyride took place in June. About 50 young men celebrated their graduation from the agency’s academy by honking and waving from a fleet of 30 rented Mercedes G-Class S.U.V.s, roaring through the streets of the capital. The vehicles, which are popular with Russian gangsters and the bodyguards who protect top government officials, cost at least $105,000 apiece in Russia. With the country in a sustained economic downturn, the sight of them careering through Moscow was hardly an image that the agency, where President Vladimir V. Putin once worked, would want to project.
0~Hurricane Andrew: How The Times Reported the Destruction of 1992~When Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said on Wednesday that Hurricane Irma, projected to make landfall in the state on Sunday, would be stronger than Hurricane Andrew, those who lived through that August 1992 storm would have had little doubt about the seriousness of the warning. If invoking the name of Andrew didn’t bring back unpleasant memories, here’s a refresher on one of the biggest natural disasters in American history. The storm was blamed for 61 deaths and an estimated $27 billion in damage, or $47.8 billion in 2017 dollars, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At the time it was the costliest hurricane in United States history; it has since been passed by Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012. Andrew hit especially hard in Dade County, home to Miami, where more than 125,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and 160,000 people were left homeless. The storm displaced 250,000 people in all.

The police instead fined him for not wearing a mask, as his hard-hit Lombardy region required people to wear masks even outside. He said he didn’t know masks were obligatory, because there had been so many confusing official decrees that “I didn’t understand anything.” It Italy, about 4.5 million people were expected to return to factories and construction sites on Monday. Joggers and cyclists can now legally go further than 200 meters from their homes. And travel for work or essential shopping or health needs can take place more broadly within each region, though travel between regions is still tightly restricted. Masks are required on public transportation and in stores, and in other closed spaces open to the public. Already, there were signs that some Italians were slipping back into their pre-virus habits. In Rome’s Villa Doria Pamphili park on Monday, teenagers in groups of six and 12 wore no masks as they squeezed together on benches or caught up, closely, with their sweethearts. Families rode by on bikes. And Giulia Quadri, a professional dog walker, took some dogs out on a “test run.” She said she had lost most of her business during the lockdown, when dog walking was an acceptable reason for people to leave their apartments. “I need to understand if I can go pick up my clients’ dogs with the car and bring them here,” she said, unclear whether that was legal or not. As Italians tried to figure out what was allowed and what was not, the big worry was that they would push the limits too far.
0~El coronavirus y el trabajo: ¿cómo están reaccionando las empresas frente al virus?~La compañía británica de televisión de paga Sky ha comenzado a inspeccionar a los visitantes en varias de sus oficinas europeas, y les ha dicho a sus empleados que los clientes que hayan viajado recientemente a países de “mayor riesgo”, como China y Japón, no podrán ingresar a sus oficinas. La aerolínea insignia de Alemania, Lufthansa, ha congelado las contrataciones y les ofreció vacaciones sin goce de sueldo a sus empleados mientras se prepara para el crecimiento del impacto económico del virus. Y el martes, la agencia de publicidad Dentsu instruyó a todos los empleados en su sede de Tokio que trabajaran desde casa. En su mayor parte, estas interrupciones en las actividades laborales diarias se han limitado a Europa y Asia. En China, la mayoría de las empresas se detuvieron en enero, cuando el gobierno trabajó para contener el brote, que ha enfermado a decenas de miles de personas y ocasionado la muerte de más de 3000. En Italia, el centro del brote en Europa, varias compañías —entre ellas el gigante de seguros Generali y la marca de moda Armani— han adoptado políticas para que sus empleados trabajen desde casa en la medida de lo posible. Stefano Conforti, un estratega de mercadotecnia digital que generalmente trabaja desde un concurrido espacio compartido de oficinas en Milán, ha laborado desde casa toda la semana, vestido con jeans y un suéter. Incluso ha considerado pasar parte de la jornada laboral en la biblioteca de su localidad.
0~If Teachers Get the Vaccine Quickly, Can Students Get Back to School?~Not every union leader expects all of their members to eagerly line up for inoculation. “Some don’t want to go back unless there is a vaccine, and others absolutely don’t believe in it,” said Marie Neisess, president of the Clark County Education Association, which represents more than 18,000 educators in Nevada. In California, E. Toby Boyd, president of the state’s largest teachers’ union, said educators have been told they will be in the second wave of vaccinations. But some teachers may be reluctant to be among the first recipients. “My members are anxious to get back to the classroom, but they’re skeptical,” said Mr. Boyd, whose organization, the California Teachers Association, represents some 300,000 members. “We need to be sure it’s safe and there are no lasting side effects.” Teachers in California also continue to push for other safety measures that they think need to be addressed before normal school can resume. “We view the vaccine as one important layer in preventing school outbreaks,” said Bethany Meyer, a special-education teacher and union leader in Oakland, Calif. “We also need testing and tracing and other mitigation measures, and that’s going to be the case for some time,” Ms. Meyer said, adding, “A vaccine is important, but our thinking is longer term than that.” In places like Miami, where public schools have been open for much of the fall, vaccinations could have a different effect. Karla Hernandez-Mats, the leader of United Teachers of Dade, said she believed that widespread vaccination among educators there would help reduce the chaos caused by frequent quarantines and classroom closures.
0~This Weekend, Watch Some of the ’80s Movies That Inspired ‘Stranger Things’~The first season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” released in the summer of 2016, remains one of the streaming service’s bona fide sensations. Although Netflix refuses to release viewership numbers about any of its series, that horror/sci-fi series set in a small Indiana town was a word-of-mouth phenomenon. All nine episodes of Season 2 drop on Friday, Oct. 27. Like its predecessor, this season borrows liberally — in terms of mood and plot — from many ’80s genre classics. Before starting your binge this weekend, dip into any of the following films.
0~Trump Denounces Justice Dept. as Investigations Swirl Around Him~The exchanges escalated the public war that Mr. Trump has waged for more than a year on the Justice Department, training most of his fire on the special counsel investigation. Mr. Sessions’s response, his most forceful public pushback yet on Mr. Trump, showed the treacherous political terrain he is navigating: appointed by a president who has made apparent that he views law enforcement as loyal protectors but overseeing a Justice Department that views independence from political pressure as essential to the rule of law. Mr. Sessions’ pushback came on a day of potentially damaging revelations for the president about the special counsel and Cohen inquiries. A longtime friend and the publisher of The National Enquirer, David J. Pecker, was given immunity to detail Mr. Cohen’s crimes and Mr. Trump’s role, a person familiar with the investigation confirmed. Mr. Trump’s lawyers also revealed that they warned him against even considering pardons for Mr. Manafort or other former aides, at least for now, opening Mr. Trump to accusations of tampering. Republicans on Capitol Hill stood firm behind Mr. Sessions, who spent two decades as a senator, publicly cautioning Mr. Trump against firing him. They cited a packed calendar and a lack of confirmable replacements for a closely divided Senate where Democrats are watching vigilantly for any moves by the president that could undermine the Russia investigation. “We don’t have time, nor is there a likely candidate who could get confirmed, in my view, under the current circumstances,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a key Republican swing vote, warned that removing Mr. Sessions because of his recusal from the Russia investigation “certainly would not be a wise move.” A spokesman for the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said he was not aware of any change in the leader’s support for Mr. Sessions. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. But there were signs of softening, too, mainly from Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the head of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Grassley has warred with Mr. Sessions over one of his top policy priorities, a comprehensive bipartisan criminal justice overhaul also championed by the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Mr. Grassley has said he believes that Mr. Sessions has led opposition within the administration to the legislative package. During Thursday’s meeting at the White House, the president held off on backing the proposal at least until after November’s midterm elections, concluding that an endorsement now carried too much political risk, according to a senior White House official who was not authorized to disclose the private discussions and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
0~Trump and His Businesses Sue House Democrats to Hide Accounting Records~The suit, which is almost certain to face a stiff challenge in court, is a familiar move for Mr. Trump, honed over a long and litigious business career. It mirrors other efforts in recent weeks by personal lawyers for the president and his businesses to block the Democratic-controlled House from gaining access to Mr. Trump’s finances. In each case, the lawyers have used vivid terms to paint Democrats as politically craven, out to abuse the powers of their office only to embarrass Mr. Trump politically. If nothing else, the suit and possible countersuits could delay the release of the documents sought by Democrats. “With this subpoena, the Oversight Committee is instead assuming the powers of the Department of Justice, investigating (dubious and partisan) allegations of illegal conduct by private individuals outside of government,” the lawyers wrote. “Its goal is to expose plaintiffs’ private financial information for the sake of exposure, with the hope that it will turn up something that Democrats can use as a political tool against the president now and in the 2020 election.” Mr. Trump and his businesses were not party to the Democratic subpoena, which was sent to Mazars this month seeking financial records and communications related to Mr. Trump and his businesses after Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s longtime fixer, told the Oversight Committee that his former boss had intentionally misrepresented his assets and liabilities to suit his needs. Inflating the value of assets would help the Trump Organization secure loans. Deflating the value of assets would minimize tax liability. “The committee has full authority to investigate whether the president may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his tenure in office, to determine whether he has undisclosed conflicts of interest that may impair his ability to make impartial policy decisions, to assess whether he is complying with the emoluments clauses of the Constitution, and to review whether he has accurately reported his finances to the Office of Government Ethics and other federal entities,” Mr. Cummings wrote in a memo to members of his committee at the time.
0~G.D.P. Report Shows U.S. Economy Shrank Again~+8 % Gross domestic product +6 +4 +2 0 –0.2% 2nd quarter 2022 –2 –4 –6 –8 ’06 ’08 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 ’20 ’22 +8 % Gross domestic product +6 +4 +2 0 –0.2% 2nd quarter 2022 –2 –4 –6 –8 ’06 ’08 ’10 ’12 ’14 ’16 ’18 ’20 ’22 A key measure of economic output fell for the second straight quarter, raising fears that the United States could be entering a recession — or perhaps that one had begun. Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the equivalent of an 0.9 percent annual rate of decline, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The 0.2 percent decline followed a contraction of 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year — meaning that by one common but unofficial definition, the U.S. economy has entered a recession a mere two years after it emerged from the last one. Most economists still don’t think the economy meets the formal definition of a recession, which is based on a broader set of indicators including measures of income, spending and employment. The G.D.P. data itself will also be revised several times in the months ahead. Still, the data released on Thursday left little doubt that the recovery is losing momentum amid high inflation and rising interest rates. Business investment and construction activity both fell in the second quarter after rising in the first. Consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, remained positive but slowed. After-tax income fell after adjusting for inflation. “We don’t think we’re in a recession just yet,” said Aditya Bhave, senior economist for Bank of America. “But the bigger point here is that the underlying trend in domestic demand is weakening. You see a clear deceleration from the first quarter.” A deceleration, on its own, isn’t necessarily bad news. The Federal Reserve has been trying to cool off the economy in a bid to tame inflation, and the White House has argued that the slowdown is part of an inevitable and necessary transition to a period of steadier growth after last year’s rapid recovery. “Coming off of last year’s historic economic growth — and regaining all the private sector jobs lost during the pandemic crisis — it’s no surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Reserve acts to bring down inflation,” President Biden said in a statement issued after the G.D.P. report. “But even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure.” Still, forecasters in recent weeks have become increasingly concerned that the Fed’s aggressive moves — including raising interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday for the second month in a row — will result in a recession. There are hints that layoffs are picking up and that consumers are struggling to keep pace with rapidly rising prices. “The job market doesn’t have to turn around that much in order for us to have a recession,” said Tim Quinlan, senior economist for Wells Fargo.
0~‘We Trusted You’: WeWork’s Chair on Adam Neumann and the Future~It hasn’t been an easy transition. In addition to stabilizing the company’s financial situation, WeWork has fielded a steady stream of headlines about the antics of its founder, Adam Neumann, and the prospect that he is likely to receive roughly $1 billion from SoftBank even as more than 4,000 employees are laid off or transferred to other employers. To Mr. Claure, Mr. Neumann — and the details of the transaction — are misunderstood, as are the company’s prospects, which he argued were strong. He recounted his conversation when he effectively ousted Mr. Neumann. “I said: ‘Adam, we trusted you. We gave you everything. And it’s fair to say things didn’t work out the way we originally planned,’” Mr. Claure said. “‘Now it’s your turn to turn around and basically pay back that trust and provide us with a proxy of all of your shares.’” Mr. Neumann ultimately complied, stepping down from the company he created in 2010. He remains a board observer and a paid consultant to WeWork. Mr. Claure said he met with Mr. Neumann often and found his input useful, but stressed that the meetings took place “outside the office.” “I value his opinion a lot in terms of where he wanted to take the business. He has 10 years of experience, and it’d be foolish not to take full advantage of — not the mistakes he has made — of the great things he created,” Mr. Claure said.
0~I giorni persi che hanno reso Bergamo una tragedia del Coronavirus~Questa provincia del Nord Italia è stata tra le zone in cui il virus ha ucciso di più in Occidente. Un’inchiesta de The New York Times ha rivelato che indicazioni fallaci e ritardi burocratici hanno fatto sì che si siano perse molte più vite del necessario. BERGAMO — Quando a metà febbraio Franco Orlandi, un ex camionista in buona salute, arriva con febbre e tosse al pronto soccorso di Bergamo, nel Nord Italia, i medici stabiliscono che ha l’influenza e lo mandano a casa. Due giorni dopo, un’ambulanza riporta indietro l’ottantatreenne. Non riesce a respirare. L’Italia non ha nemmeno un caso di coronavirus nel suo territorio a quel punto, ma i sintomi del signor Orlandi lasciano perplessa la Dottoressa Monica Avogadri, l’anestesista 55enne che lo ha preso in cura all’Ospedale Pesenti Fenaroli. Non lo sottopone al test per il coronavirus perché i protocolli italiani, adottati sulla base di quelli dell’Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanità, raccomandano di sottoporre al tampone solo le persone che hanno una connessione con la Cina, dove è iniziata l’epidemia. Alla domanda se il signor Orlandi avesse un legame con la Cina, sua moglie risponde disorientata. A malapena frequentavano il Patty’s Bar, il bar del quartiere, dice. “La Cina?” risponde al medico. Non sapeva neppure dove fosse. Quel che la Dottoressa Avogadri non sapeva è che il Covid-19 era già arrivato nella sua regione, in Lombardia, una scoperta che avrebbe fatto cinque giorni dopo che un altro medico nella vicina città di Lodi, aveva deciso di violare i protocolli nazionali facendo un tampone ad un paziente. A quel punto anche la Dottoressa Avogadri, a cui quegli stessi protocolli avevano legato le mani, dopo giorni trascorsi a occuparsi del signor Orlandi e di altri pazienti, si era ammalata. Il suo ospedale, invece di identificare e curare la malattia, era diventato un acceleratore della sua diffusione in quello che è il cuore pulsante dell’economia italiana.
0~Gov. J.B. Pritzker Signs Law Making Illinois First State to End Cash Bail~Illinois has become the first state to completely eliminate cash bail, a result of a push by state legislators to end a practice they say keeps poor people in jail for months awaiting trial and disproportionately affects Black and Latino defendants. The change is part of a sweeping law signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, on Monday. He said the legislation would transform the state’s legal system and increase accountability measures for police officers, such as requiring the use of body-worn cameras by police departments statewide. “This legislation marks a substantial step toward dismantling the systemic racism that plagues our communities, our state and our nation and brings us closer to true safety, true fairness and true justice,” Mr. Pritzker said in a statement. Over the years, New Jersey, California and New York have limited the use of bail, a system that opponents have criticized as unfair to poor people, who are forced to remain in detention even though they have not been convicted of the charges that led to their arrest. Supporters of the elimination of cash bail have pointed to cases like that of Kalief Browder, who was 16 when he was ordered held for three years at Rikers Island because his family could not afford a $3,000 bail. Mr. Browder, who was accused of stealing a backpack, killed himself two years after his release, when he was 22.
0~Taiwan Set to Receive $2 Billion in U.S. Arms, Drawing Ire From China~TAIPEI, Taiwan — The United States has tentatively approved the sale of $2 billion in military hardware to Taiwan, demonstrating support for its unofficial ally in a move likely to exacerbate deteriorating ties between Washington and Beijing. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, part of the United States Defense Department, notified Congress of two proposed arms sales on Monday. The first notification included 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as Hercules armored vehicles and heavy equipment transporters. The second included more than $220 million in Stinger antiaircraft missiles. The tentative approvals come as relations between the United States and China are already being tested by a trade war and the decoupling of technology supply chains. The armaments would provide Taiwan with greater deterrence capabilities against the growing military threat from China, experts said.
0~The World According to Dan Brown~As the story begins, Edmond Kirsch — “billionaire computer scientist, futurist, inventor and entrepreneur” — is preparing to present a new discovery to an eager crowd (and to the world, via the internet) at the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain. He has promised that this announcement, the details of which are enticingly withheld until the very end of the book, will upend people’s view of religion by proving irrefutably that life can be created using the laws of science, thus excising God from the equation. (The theory is real, borrowed from the M.I.T. physicist Jeremy England.) “Origin,” is to be published by Doubleday Oct. 3, with an initial printing of 2 million copies, eventually extending to several dozen countries in 42 languages, according to the publisher. Readers will find in it a familiar swirl of big ideas and nonstop action, so that those who aren’t enchanted by the erudition can find relief in the plot, and vice versa. Mr. Brown, 53, spent four years writing and researching the book. He is nothing if not disciplined. He rises at 4 a.m. each day and prepares a smoothie comprising “blueberries, spinach, banana, coconut water, chia seeds, hemp seeds and … what’s the other kind of seed?” he asked. “Flax seeds, and this sort of weird protein powder made out of peas.” He also makes so-called bulletproof coffee, with butter and coconut oil, which he says changes “the way your brain processes the caffeine” so as to sharpen your mind. His computer is programmed to freeze for 60 seconds each hour, during which time Mr. Brown performs push-ups, situps and anything else he needs to do. Though he stops writing at noon, it’s hard for him to get the stories out of his head. “It’s madness,” he said of his characters. “They talk to you all day.” Image Credit... Patricia Wall/The New York Tiimes Mr. Brown’s books have made him rich, but he does not have the aura of a rich person. His house, concealed behind gates, is not so much the home of a flashy millionaire as that of a person with the means to alter his surroundings in any wildly idiosyncratic way he (and his wife) want to.
0~Ukraine Points to Added Urgency as Russia Reinforces Southern Front~Image Ukrainian soldiers in a bunker in the south of the country last week. Credit... Daniel Berehulak for The New York Times Ukraine expressed a heightened sense of urgency on Thursday over its looming counteroffensive in the south, saying Russia was racing to bolster its forces in the region and taking further steps to solidify its political hold in the territory it controls. Russia directed dozens of missiles at targets across Ukraine overnight into Thursday, including 25 fired from Belarus, according to the Ukrainian military, even as it moved soldiers and equipment to the southern region of Kherson. In the east, Ukrainian forces continue to hold their defensive lines while targeting key command-and-control centers and Russian troop strongholds deep behind Russian lines. The Ukrainians have been setting the stage for a broad counteroffensive in the south for some time, and recent long-range missile strikes have left thousands of Russian soldiers stationed west of the Dnipro River around the port city of Kherson in a precarious position, largely cut off from Russian strongholds to the east. But Russia is now moving “the maximum number” of forces to the southern front in the Kherson region, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council told Ukrainian television late Wednesday. The official, Oleksiy Danilov, described “a very powerful movement of their troops” to the front in Kherson. While Western weapons continue to arrive in the country, they are needed on multiple fronts and ammunition remains limited. And Ukrainian officials have grown increasingly frustrated with what they believe is Western countries’ slow walking of weapons deliveries. “Just give them weapons and let them work,” said Natalya Gumenyuk, the spokeswoman for Ukraine’s southern military command, which is responsible for the Kherson offensive. “They pat us on the shoulder and say, ‘Just hang on,’” she said. “We need more than just moral support, though we are grateful for it. We need real support, real weapons, real ammunition for those weapons.” And even though Ukraine’s Western allies are racing to train Ukrainian soldiers on new equipment, that, too, remains a work in progress. The Russians have also had months to fortify their defensive lines, and the Ukrainians have yet to launch any major land-based counteroffensive. Mr. Danilov’s comments reflected the urgency for the government in Kyiv to show progress as it continued to build expectations in a nation hungry for positive developments after months of brutal fighting. The Russians have also suffered grievous losses. Although casualty counts are highly speculative, the Biden administration has told lawmakers that over 75,000 soldiers fighting for Russia have been killed or injured in less than six months. The Russians are now weakened but are actively strengthening and amassing their forces, said a senior Ukrainian official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military assessments. Accordingly, the official said, Ukraine expects an increased intensity of military action from them. The most promising front for the Ukrainians for any possible major advances is in the western part of Kherson, where they are aided by the nation’s geography. The Dnipro River runs the length of Ukraine, bisecting the nation into east and west. The Kherson region is itself divided by the river, with the regional capital and critical port city of Kherson on the western bank. Ukrainian officials and Western military analysts said the strikes this week on a key bridge across the Dnipro and other critical roads and bridges in recent days had left the Russian occupation forces around Kherson city particularly exposed. A British intelligence report said on Thursday that Russia’s main fighting force on the western side of the river “now looks highly vulnerable” because of the strikes on the bridge. “Kherson city, the most politically significant population center occupied by Russia, is now virtually cut off from the other occupied territories,” the report said. “Its loss would severely undermine Russia’s attempts to paint the occupation as a success.” The senior Ukrainian official said that Ukraine had a chance to push the Russians from Kherson with adequate weapons and equipment, but the official declined to say whether such supplies were currently sufficient for beginning a large-scale push.
0~Biden Forms Task Force to Explore Ways to Help Labor~President Biden signed an executive order on Monday creating a White House task force to promote labor organizing, an attempt to use the power of the federal government to reverse a decades-long decline in union membership. The task force, to be led by Vice President Kamala Harris and populated by cabinet officials and top White House advisers, will issue recommendations on how the government can use existing authority to help workers join labor unions and bargain collectively. It will also recommend new policies aimed at achieving these goals. The administration noted that the National Labor Relations Act, the 1935 law governing federal labor rights, explicitly sought to encourage collective bargaining, but that the law had never been fully carried out in this regard. “No previous administration has taken a comprehensive approach to determining how the executive branch can advance worker organizing and collective bargaining,” a White House statement declared. Unions have lobbied for the passage of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, which would prohibit employers from holding mandatory anti-union meetings and impose financial penalties for violating workers’ labor rights. (Workers can currently receive only so-called make-whole remedies, like back pay.) The House passed the measure in March and Mr. Biden supports the legislation, but it faces long odds in the Senate.
0~Donald Trump Could Threaten U.S. Rule of Law, Scholars Say~“He’s led the way, to be honest with you,” he said in January on “Meet the Press,” referring to Mr. Obama’s program to spare millions of immigrants in the country unlawfully from deportation. “But I’m going to use them much better, and they’re going to serve a much better purpose than what he’s done.” But Mr. Post said there was a difference between Mr. Obama’s view of executive power and that of Mr. Trump. “Whatever you think of Obama’s position on immigration, he is willing to submit to the courts,” he said. “There is no suggestion that he will disobey if the courts rule against him.” Several law professors said they were less sure about Mr. Trump, citing the actions of another populist, President Andrew Jackson, who refused to enforce an 1832 Supreme Court decision arising from a clash between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation. “I can easily see a situation in which he would take the Andrew Jackson line,” Professor Epstein said, referring to a probably apocryphal comment attributed to Jackson about Chief Justice John Marshall: “John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.” There are other precedents, said John C. Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who took an expansive view of executive power as a lawyer in the Bush administration. “The only two other presidents I can think of who were so hostile to judges on an individual level and to the judiciary as a whole would be Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt,” he said. Both of those presidents chafed at what they saw as excessive judicial power. “But they weren’t doing it because they had cases before those judges as individuals,” Professor Yoo said. “They had legitimate separation-of-powers fights between the presidency and the judiciary. Trump is lashing out because he has a lawsuit in a private capacity, which is much more disturbing.” Other legal scholars said they were worried about Mr. Trump’s commitment to the First Amendment. He has taken particular aim at The Washington Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.
0~Gretchen Carlson, Former Fox Anchor, Speaks Publicly About Sexual Harassment Lawsuit~MONTCLAIR, N.J. — When Gretchen Carlson was asked how her last week had been, she looked down at her wrist. “These are the bracelets I wear on my arm,” Ms. Carlson, the former Fox News anchor, said in an interview on Tuesday. She stood up from her seat at the dining room table here in the home of her lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, and pointed to three silver bracelets, each emblazoned with text. “Carpe diem,” she said, reading the words. “Brave. Fearless.” Speaking publicly for the first time since she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former boss, Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman, Ms. Carlson repeated the allegations she made in the suit, saying Mr. Ailes made sexual advances toward her and later fired her because she complained about sexual harassment at the network.
0~Majority of Latino Voters Out of G.O.P.’s Reach, New Poll Shows~It has been nearly two years since Donald Trump made surprising gains with Hispanic voters. But Republican dreams of a major realignment of Latino voters drawn to G.O.P. stances on crime and social issues have failed to materialize, according to a new poll by The New York Times and Siena College. The poll — one of the largest nonpartisan surveys of Latino voters since the 2020 election — found that Democrats had maintained a grip on the majority of Latino voters, driven in part by women and the belief that Democrats remained the party of the working class. Overall, Hispanic voters are more likely to agree with Democrats on many issues — immigration, gun policy, climate. They are also more likely to see Republicans as the party of the elite and as holding extreme views. And a majority of Hispanic voters, 56 percent, plan to vote for Democrats this fall, compared with 32 percent for Republicans. But the survey also shows worrying signs for the future of the Democratic message. Despite that comfortable lead, the poll finds Democrats faring far worse than they did in the years before the 2020 election. Younger male Hispanic voters, especially those in the South, appear to be drifting away from the party, a shift that is propelled by deep economic concerns. Weaknesses in the South and among rural voters could stand in the way of crucial wins in Texas and Florida in this year’s midterms. Anthony Saiz, 24, who reviews content for a social media platform in Tucson, Ariz., said he had to take on a second job baking pizzas at a beer garden to make ends meet. Mr. Saiz voted for President Biden in 2020 and considers himself a Democrat because he grew up in a Democratic household. But under Mr. Biden, he said, the cost of living seemed to have doubled for him even as he moved into a smaller apartment.
0~Face Mask Hoarders May Raise Risk of Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” [music] Today: China says it has made lifesaving reforms since the last time it was the source of a public health crisis 17 years ago. So why is the deadly coronavirus spreading so rapidly across the country? My colleague, Javier Hernández, reports from the center of the outbreak. It’s Thursday, January 30. Javier, how did you first hear about this outbreak? javier hernández Well, we started hearing reports in early January that there was this mysterious virus that was affecting Wuhan, which is a city in central China. archived recording Staff at Wuhan Hospital are working around the clock to identify a mystery virus. javier hernández People were falling ill to this kind of pneumonia-like virus, which scientists were calling a coronavirus. archived recording Experts believe this is a new kind of coronavirus, which typically causes symptoms of the common cold, but in some rare cases, can lead to pneumonia. javier hernández It’s a very frightening virus that spreads from animals to humans. It was believed to be behind some very serious respiratory illnesses, so it sounded pretty scary. But the official narrative was that this strain couldn’t pass from human to human. It would only go from animals to humans. archived recording The potentially deadly coronavirus is thought to have spread from animals into humans at a live produce market in Wuhan. javier hernández And at that point, they were saying that it was all originating at a single meat market in central China. This meat market sold wild animals, things like bamboo rats, badgers, wolves even. And the assumption was that people had come into contact with these animals and picked up this virus. michael barbaro And it sounds like because it was one meat market, and because this virus could only pass from animals to humans, that this is a pretty small problem. javier hernández At this point, the reports were that only about 130 people had been infected and that, of those, only about four had died. archived recording Chinese officials say the outbreak is under control. javier hernández And so the prognosis was that the outbreak was controllable, that it was treatable and that things would be O.K. michael barbaro And Javier, what are you thinking when you hear the Chinese government talking this way, saying that everything is going to be O.K.? javier hernández We were a bit skeptical. We knew that the Chinese government had a history of downplaying outbreaks like this. And as we saw more and more reports in the international media of this virus spreading, we began to question whether the officials were being totally upfront about what was happening. michael barbaro And what do you mean when you say a history of downplaying situations like this? javier hernández Well before this virus, there was the outbreak of SARS 17 years ago. And it turned into this global health crisis that infected more than 8,000 people. It killed more than 800 people. And a big part of the reason that it spread so violently was because the Chinese government didn’t tell the world. And there was this period of months and months when it was spreading very rapidly in China, and the world just didn’t know about it. And for a lot of Chinese today, that experience with SARS makes them very skeptical of anything that the government says when it comes to public health. michael barbaro And I imagine a reporter like you would be similarly skeptical. javier hernández Right. We really wanted to make sure that we got this one right. We wanted to double check that this was, in fact, a small scale outbreak as the government was portraying it. And we wanted to talk to people who were getting sick with this virus to get a sense of what it was like for them — how severe it was, whether they were getting the care they needed. michael barbaro And so what do you do? javier hernández So I live in Beijing. So I rushed to our bureau here and grabbed masks, enough to last me a couple days, and then headed to the airport and boarded a flight to Wuhan. And I just remember everyone on board, almost everyone, was wearing a mask. I was just struck by that. You never see people wear masks on this scale. And so it felt like there was this sense of anxiety already in the air even before we landed. [music] Once I got there, I rushed off to meet an ambulance doctor who had been posting on social media about this outbreak. And we had contacted him because he was challenging the official narrative about what was happening. He was saying he didn’t believe the official numbers. He thought that this could be another SARS-like outbreak. michael barbaro And what was happening to his posts once they went online? javier hernández They lasted for a while, and then they would be taken down, just disappeared. It was clear that the government was cleaning and trying to scrub the internet of any critical questions about official data. And so we wanted to talk to him about what he was seeing on the ground. michael barbaro And what did he tell you? javier hernández He told me that he felt like people weren’t taking enough precautions, that the government wasn’t being urgent enough. And he worked in a hospital and had a lot of interaction with doctors and other medical workers. So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come forward publicly. michael barbaro So the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small. This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of information? javier hernández We wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a 40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe. [CHATTER] michael barbaro And what is the story of what happened to his stepmom? javier hernández He tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu. So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was told that she would likely die. michael barbaro And what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her illness? javier hernández They didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr. Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and other medical workers refused. He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it said was that she died of severe pneumonia. michael barbaro But why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they wouldn’t test her? javier hernández It became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital, according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned immediately, had to be cremated immediately. [CHATTER] michael barbaro And what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re burning these bodies? javier hernández It began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps they thought it posed a threat to other people. Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed like the numbers weren’t right. michael barbaro So at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next? javier hernández So I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports emerging on social media — archived recording For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease could be contagious. javier hernández — that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the case before. archived recording (zhong nanshan) [SPEAKING CHINESE] archived recording (translator) We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed that it is contagious among humans. javier hernández And he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially. He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than had been previously known. michael barbaro So this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing. javier hernández Yes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able to infect 14 medical workers. michael barbaro Wow. javier hernández And I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media. archived recording 1 Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now? archived recording 2 It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever, it can be transmitted. archived recording 3 But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating. javier hernández This is the moment when the world begins to wake up. archived recording 1 Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well. archived recording 2 Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China. archived recording 3 — because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have airports here in the United States very concerned about it — archived recording 4 That are doing surveillance. archived recording 5 — here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing exponentially. archived recording 6 It is. It’s growing. javier hernández The numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling. archived recording 1 The number of people who have died — archived recording 2 The death toll climbing once again overnight. archived recording 3 The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus — archived recording 4 26 deaths so far from the — archived recording 5 — has now passed 40. archived recording 6 [SPEAKING CHINESE] archived recording 7 It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried. They’re all afraid of dying. javier hernández You just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be contained. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care of those who are sickened and infected by this illness. javier hernández Yeah. michael barbaro Are you anxious? javier hernández Well I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me. The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful. michael barbaro I mean, understandably. javier hernández So I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing. archived recording Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with families, an unprecedented act. javier hernández And then the very next day, I hear — archived recording Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on lockdown. javier hernández The Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown. michael barbaro Wow. archived recording Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt. michael barbaro So the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who remains that they’re not going anywhere. javier hernández Right. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in recent times. archived recording Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic. javier hernández And it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t just a local problem. archived recording Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people. javier hernández They quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen. archived recording 1 Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been stopped. archived recording 2 Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese government will prove effective. michael barbaro It’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city somehow being locked down. javier hernández So this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply with this mass lockdown. michael barbaro You know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t China’s government have been able to identify and control this outbreak before it got out of hand? javier hernández You would think that, because the government is so well known for being able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis. michael barbaro What do you mean? javier hernández Well for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody will ever hear about it. michael barbaro So by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain it themselves and keep it from Beijing. javier hernández Exactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But eventually it broke. michael barbaro So did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led to that breakdown, that cover-up? javier hernández China said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President Xi. michael barbaro Why? javier hernández He has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing this unsavory story into public view. michael barbaro So that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm. javier hernández Right. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis. They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods. michael barbaro So it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this. javier hernández At the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and that affect people’s lives. michael barbaro Right. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t, right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to speak out about something like a public health crisis. javier hernández Exactly. And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives around the world in danger. michael barbaro Javier, thank you. javier hernández Thanks, Michael. michael barbaro On Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than 6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, its most severe classification. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the book contains significant amounts of classified information that could harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later today. [music]
0~Uber Faces Federal Inquiry Over Use of Greyball Tool to Evade Authorities~SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is the subject of a United States Department of Justice inquiry over a program that it used to deceive regulators who were trying to shut down its ride-hailing service. The inquiry concerns Uber’s use of a software tool called Greyball, which the company developed in part to aid entrance into new markets where its service was not permitted. The tool allowed Uber to deploy what was essentially a fake version of its app to evade law enforcement agencies that were cracking down on its service. The New York Times reported on Greyball in March, raising questions about the legality of the practice. After the report, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the software to thwart regulators. The federal inquiry was disclosed in a transportation audit conducted by the City of Portland, Ore., published last week. In the audit, Portland officials said they had been notified by the United States attorney’s office for the Northern District of California about the existence of the inquiry. The City of Portland said it was cooperating with the inquiry.
0~Los Angeles, Chicago Back Vaccine Mandate for Teachers~As schools prepare to reopen five days per week amid an alarming surge in the coronavirus, Los Angeles and Chicago, the second- and third-largest districts in the nation, announced on Friday some of the strongest teacher vaccine mandates to date. Educators and school staff in both cities will have to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 15. School begins in Los Angeles on Aug. 16 and in Chicago on Aug. 30. In Los Angeles, district employees will also have to submit to regular virus testing, regardless of vaccination status. In Chicago, staff will be tested weekly until the vaccine deadline. Both systems said there will be an exemption process for those with disabling medical conditions or sincerely held religious beliefs. California and Illinois are also both requiring everyone to use masks inside schools when they reopen.
0~Trump Foresees Virus Death Toll as High as 100,000 in the United States~Mr. Trump predicted that a vaccine would be developed by the end of 2020, which would be sooner than some public health experts anticipate and much faster than any other vaccine for such a major virus. “We are very confident that we’re going to have a vaccine at the end of the year, by the end of the year,” he said. Even if it is developed that soon, though, he did not say whether it could be approved and produced in sufficient quantities for widespread use by then. The president confirmed that he was warned about the virus, which originated in China, in an intelligence briefing in January, but asserted that it was characterized as if “it was not a big deal.” He said intelligence agencies would release information about his briefings as early as Monday. “On Jan. 23, I was told that there could be a virus coming in but it was of no real import,” Mr. Trump said. “In other words, it wasn’t, ‘Oh, we’ve got to do something, we’ve got to do something.’ It was a brief conversation and it was only on Jan. 23. Shortly thereafter, I closed the country to China. We had 23 people in the room and I was the only one in the room who wanted to close it down.” Mr. Trump was referring to his decision on Jan. 30 to block entry by most foreign nationals coming from China, a move that in fact was supported by a number of his advisers and came only after major American airlines had already canceled flights. Some public health advisers have said that the travel limits helped slow the spread to the United States but that the Trump administration did not use the extra time to adequately prepare by ramping up testing and producing medical equipment. Mr. Trump said his travel limit, which did not apply to Americans or legal residents, was not driven by the Jan. 23 warning. “I didn’t do it because of what they said,” he said. “They said it very matter of factly. It was not a big deal.” In forecasting the toll of the virus, the White House had relied on models by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which last month had predicted 60,415 deaths by the first week of August. Last week, the institute increased its estimate to 72,433 by early August. But now the toll looks likely to pass that number within a week. “It looks like we’re headed to a number substantially below the 100,000,” Mr. Trump had said on April 10. “That would be the low mark. And I hope that bears out.” He said a lower number would amount to a victory for him. “Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 — you could never be happy, but that’s a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking.” As late as April 20, he said “we’re going toward 50 or 60,000 people.”
0~Gregory and Travis McMichael Arrested in Killing of Ahmaud Arbery~The video of the shooting, taken from inside a vehicle, shows Mr. Arbery running along a shaded two-lane residential road when he comes upon a white truck, with a man standing beside its open driver’s-side door. Another man is in the bed of the pickup. Mr. Arbery runs around the truck and disappears briefly from view. Muffled shouting can be heard before Mr. Arbery emerges, tussling with the man outside the truck as three shotgun blasts echo. [Read more about the third person charged in Ahmaud Arbery’s death.] The case is the latest in the United States to raise concerns about racial inequities in the justice system. Documents obtained by The New York Times show that a Georgia prosecutor who had the case for weeks before recusing himself over a conflict of interest had advised the Glynn County Police Department that there was “insufficient probable cause” to issue arrest warrants for the McMichaels. The prosecutor, George E. Barnhill of Georgia’s Waycross Judicial Circuit, noted that the McMichaels were carrying their weapons legally under Georgia law. He also cited the state’s citizen’s arrest law, and the statute on self-defense. Mr. Barnhill argued that Mr. Arbery, who appeared to be unarmed, had initiated the fight with Travis McMichael, and was thus “allowed to use deadly force to protect himself.”
0~A Fed governor argues for quickly cutting bond-buying, as debate intensifies.~Image Mr. Waller in 2020. “You could taper in October; you don’t have to wait until January,” he said on Monday. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Federal Reserve officials are divided over when and how they should begin reducing their monetary policy support as America’s economy rebounds, and they are increasingly airing their divergent views in public. Among the most candid remarks yet came from Christopher J. Waller, the Fed’s newest governor, during an interview with CNBC on Monday. Mr. Waller said that he would support slowing the Fed’s big bond purchases “early” and “fast,” and he indicated that he would have preferred to first slow purchases of mortgage-backed securities — something Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, more or less took off the table in comments last week. “The labor market should really take off starting in August and September,” Mr. Waller said, assuming that the opening of schools is not delayed by the Delta variant. If the economy continues to add jobs rapidly — perhaps at a pace of 800,000 to 1 million jobs per month — he said he thinks the Fed needs to get moving. “In my view, with tapering, we should go early and go fast to make sure we’re in position to raise rates in 2022 if we have to,” Mr. Waller said. “You could taper in October; you don’t have to wait until January.” Mr. Waller’s comments are in line with those made by James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (and Mr. Waller’s former boss) last week. Mr. Bullard also favors moving relatively rapidly to slow the Fed’s bond-buying. That policy tool boosts the economy by lowering longer-term interest rates and by keeping money flowing into stocks and other riskier investments. He, too, wants to get going so that the Fed is prepared to raise rates next year, if needed. Most Fed officials signaled in their June economic projections that they expect to lift interest rates in 2023 at the earliest. And influential policymakers, notably Lael Brainard, another Fed governor, have struck a much more patient tone when it comes to dialing back bond purchases. “I expect to be more confident in assessing the rate of progress once we have data in hand for September, when consumption, school, and work patterns should be settling into a post-pandemic normal,” Ms. Brainard said in remarks released on Friday. Because economic data are reported at a delay, that would suggest that the Fed will only have a clear reading on the numbers they want to see before announcing tapering — which it wants to signal in advance — by mid-to-late October. The central bank does not have an October meeting, but it will gather in early November. Show more
0~Coronavirus Claims at Least 6,900 Nursing Home Deaths in U.S.~“You may have just that one patient with the coronavirus that come into your facility, and you don’t know. I can go to work today, wind up feeding them. And then find out two hours later, ‘Oh, they have that virus.’ And I’ve already been exposed. Nursing Assistants, CNA’s, we’re the closest ones, we’re the front line.” The work of nursing assistants has always been difficult and low paying. But add coronavirus, and it’s become dangerous. TV announcers: “Across the country, nursing homes are especially vulnerable —” “One elder care facility, where 19 residents have died —” “In Palo Alto —” “In the New Orleans area —” “In DuPage County —” “In Sacramento County.” “Covid-19 spreading through our most vulnerable population.” We met up with caregivers from nursing homes in Northern California. They attend to the kind of patients who are most likely to die if they get the virus. “So can you do your job without touching people, or without —” “It’s impossible. Everything is touch.” “Bathing. Feeding.” “Assist them to the restroom.” “Brushing their teeth.” “Turning.” “It’s almost like a holding and cleaning at the same time.” “Helping nurses with wound care.” “Cleaning their ears, tying their shoes.” “We do everything.” “Well, you could be feeding that patient or you could be doing something and the patient starts coughing. It’s too late to turn around, you already done got crap all over you. You know, you just run to the bathroom, wash your face or whatever. And then go about your day. Social distance? Can’t do it. It’s impossible.” If this video were filmed at a different time, you’d be seeing footage of these workers with their patients. But nursing homes are closed to visitors right now to protect the people inside. Actually everything you’re seeing here we filmed from afar, following recommendations to slow the spread of Covid-19. But these caregivers can’t maintain that kind of distance in their work. And now, shortages of protective gear like masks are putting them at risk, not just for getting the virus but for spreading it. “If you want to speak, press star 6.” “We’re running out of supplies of masks in our building. And trying to take care of these patients without us also getting sick is worrisome.” “We’re rationing right now, masks, protective gear. But it’s like, what happens if we run out? It scares me.” “They gave us the N95 mask, and told us to maintain it. If the elastic comes off by accident or something, staple and reuse it.” “So you’re actually cleaning the N95 masks in between uses?” “Yeah, with — with alcohol.” “You like wipe off the outside of it or how do you do that?” “The outside, the inside and just let it air dry, and put it back in a Ziploc bag for the next day.” “A lot of people in this field, we have families. So you don’t want to take nothing home. My granddaughter, she’s special needs. So she has a low immune system. When she was born, she was really sick. So we’ve been cautious ever since she’s been born.” “I am very concerned of taking it home. My mom, she’s diabetic, and my dad also just beat cancer in the thyroid. I have asthma. So if I were to get Covid, It would affect my lungs. And how am I going to pay my bills? Because it’s paycheck to paycheck, what I’m doing.” The pay for this work is low: In the U.S., the median salary is less than $30,000 a year. As a result, many nursing assistants work multiple jobs. And as they move between facilities, so can disease. “Usually when I finish the first job, I go right to the second job. I work 16 hours, that’s not including driving time. And I’m not the only one — majority of my co-workers, they work two jobs.” “I work home health care too, on top of taking care of my mom and my grandmother. I’m kind of worried because you don’t see the virus because they’re droplets, and you don’t know who’s coughing or sneezing on you. Even though I do try to sanitize, like along the way, going to my next client. But sometimes it’s just not enough I think. But who else is going to take care of them?”
0~Silicon Valley Is Not Your Friend~Illustration by Yoshi Sodeoka Illustration by Yoshi Sodeoka Illustration by Yoshi Sodeoka LATE last month, Mark Zuckerberg wrote a brief post on Facebook at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, asking his friends for forgiveness not just for his personal failures but also for his professional ones, especially “the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together.” He was heeding the call of the Jewish Day of Atonement to take stock of the year just passed as he pledged that he would “work to do better.” Such a somber, self-critical statement hasn’t been typical for the usually sunny Mr. Zuckerberg, who once exhorted his employees at Facebook to “move fast and break things.” In the past, why would Mr. Zuckerberg, or any of his peers, have felt the need to atone for what they did at the office? For making incredibly cool sites that seamlessly connect billions of people to their friends as well as to a global storehouse of knowledge? Lately, however, the sins of Silicon Valley-led disruption have become impossible to ignore. Facebook has endured a drip, drip of revelations concerning Russian operatives who used its platform to influence the 2016 presidential election by stirring up racist anger. Google had a similar role in carrying targeted, inflammatory messages during the election, and this summer, it appeared to play the heavy when an important liberal think tank, New America, cut ties with a prominent scholar who is critical of the power of digital monopolies. Some within the organization questioned whether he was dismissed to appease Google and its executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, both longstanding donors, though New America’s executive president and a Google representative denied a connection. Meanwhile, Amazon, with its purchase of the Whole Foods supermarket chain and the construction of brick-and-mortar stores, pursues the breathtakingly lucrative strategy of parlaying a monopoly position online into an offline one, too. Now that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the question of the hour is, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is? These menacing turns of events have been quite bewildering to the public, running counter to everything Silicon Valley had preached about itself. Google, for example, says its purpose is “to organize the world’s information, making it universally accessible and useful,” a quest that could describe your local library as much as a Fortune 500 company. Similarly, Facebook aims to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.” Even Amazon looked outside itself for fulfillment by seeking to become, in the words of its founder, Jeff Bezos, “the most customer-obsessed company to ever occupy planet Earth.” Almost from its inception, the World Wide Web produced public anxiety — your computer was joined to a network that was beyond your ken and could send worms, viruses and trackers your way — but we nonetheless were inclined to give these earnest innovators the benefit of the doubt. They were on our side in making the web safe and useful, and thus it became easy to interpret each misstep as an unfortunate accident on the path to digital utopia rather than as subterfuge meant to ensure world domination. Now that Google, Facebook, Amazon have become world dominators, the questions of the hour are, can the public be convinced to see Silicon Valley as the wrecking ball that it is? And do we still have the regulatory tools and social cohesion to restrain the monopolists before they smash the foundations of our society? By all accounts, these programmers turned entrepreneurs believed their lofty words and were at first indifferent to getting rich from their ideas. A 1998 paper by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, then computer-science graduate students at Stanford, stressed the social benefits of their new search engine, Google, which would be open to the scrutiny of other researchers and wouldn’t be advertising-driven. The public needed to be assured that searches were uncorrupted, that no one had put his finger on the scale for business reasons. To illustrate their point, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page boasted of the purity of their search engine’s results for the query “cellular phone”; near the top was a study explaining the danger of driving while on the phone. The Google prototype was still ad-free, but what about the others, which took ads? Mr. Brin and Mr. Page had their doubts: “We expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.” There was a crucial need for “a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm,” and Google was set to be that ivory tower internet tool. Until, that is, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page were swept up by the entrepreneurism pervasive to Stanford — a meeting with a professor led to a meeting with an investor, who wrote a $100,000 check before Google was even a company. In 1999, Google announced a $25 million investment of venture capital while insisting nothing had changed. When Mr. Brin was asked by reporters how Google planned to make money, he replied, “Our goal is to maximize the search experience, not maximize the revenues from search.” Mark Zuckerberg took a similar tack back in the early days of Facebook. A social network was too important to sully with commerce, he told The Harvard Crimson in 2004. “I mean, yeah, we can make a bunch of money — that’s not the goal,” he said of his social network, then still called thefacebook.com. “Anyone from Harvard can get a job and make a bunch of money. Not everyone at Harvard can have a social network. I value that more as a resource more than, like, any money.” Mr. Zuckerberg insisted he wouldn’t give in to the profit seekers; Facebook would stay true to its mission of connecting the world. Seven years later, Mr. Zuckerberg, too, had succumbed to Silicon Valley venture capital, but he seemed to regret it. “If I were starting now,” he told an interviewer in 2011, “I just would have stayed in Boston, I think,” before adding: “There are aspects of the culture out here where I think it still is a little bit short-term focused in a way that bothers me. You know, whether it’s like people who want to start companies to start a company, not knowing what they like, I don’t know, to, like, flip it.” Ultimately, however, the founders of Google and Facebook faced a day of reckoning. Investors hadn’t signed on for a charity, and they demanded accountability. In the end, Mr. Brin and Mr. Page agreed under pressure to display advertising alongside search results and eventually to allow an outside chief executive, Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to include ads within the news feed and transferred a favorite programmer to the mobile-advertising business, telling him, “Wouldn’t it be fun to build a billion-dollar business in six months?” Turns out that there were billion-dollar fortunes to be made by exploiting the foggy relationship between the public and tech companies. We all knew there was no such thing as a free lunch, an insight memorably encapsulated in 2010 by a commenter to the website MetaFilter, as, “If you are not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.” But, really, how can you tell? So much of what is happening between the public and Silicon Valley is out of view — algorithms written and controlled by wizards who are able to extract value from your identity in ways you could never do for yourself. Once Mr. Brin, Mr. Page and Mr. Zuckerberg reversed course on pursuing profits, they reported an odd thing — the public didn’t seem to care. “Do you know the most common feedback, honestly?” Mr. Brin said in 2002 when asked about the reaction to Google’s embrace of advertising. “It’s ‘What ads?’ People either haven’t done searches that bring them up or haven’t noticed them. Or the third possibility is that they brought up the ads and they did notice them and they forgot about them, which I think is the most likely scenario.” Growth becomes the overriding motivation — something treasured for its own sake, not for anything it brings to the world. Interactions between people and their computers were always going to be confusing, and that confusion would be easy for programmers to exploit. John McCarthy, the computer-science pioneer who nurtured the first hackers at M.I.T. and later ran Stanford’s artificial intelligence lab, worried that programmers didn’t understand their responsibilities. “Computers will end up with the psychology that is convenient to their designers (and they’ll be fascist bastards if those designers don’t think twice),” he wrote in 1983. “Program designers have a tendency to think of the users as idiots who need to be controlled. They should rather think of their program as a servant, whose master, the user, should be able to control it.” Call it the Eliza problem. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor at M.I.T., unveiled a computer program, Eliza, which imitated a psychotherapist. It would, by rote, inquire about your feelings toward your parents or try to get you talking by rephrasing what you said in the form of a question. The program immediately touched a nerve, becoming a national phenomenon, to the surprise of Mr. Weizenbaum. For example, The New York Times swooned: “Computer Is Being Taught to Understand English.” Eliza understood nothing, in truth, and could never reach any shared insight with a “patient.” Eliza mechanically responded to whatever appeared on the screen. A typical therapy session quickly devolved into a Monty Python sketch. (Patient: You are not very aggressive, but I think you don’t want me to notice that. Eliza: What makes you think I am not very aggressive? Patient: You don’t argue with me. Eliza: Why do you think I don’t argue with you? Patient: You are afraid of me. Eliza: Does it please you to believe I am afraid of you?) Imagine Mr. Weizenbaum’s surprise when his secretary looked up from her computer and interrupted her exchanges with Eliza to say to him, “Would you mind leaving the room, please?” She wanted privacy for a conversation with a machine! Mr. Weizenbaum, appalled, suddenly saw the potential for mischief by programmers who could manipulate computers and potentially the rest of us. He soon switched gears and devoted his remaining years to protesting what he considered the amorality of his computer science peers, frequently referring to his experiences as a young refugee from Nazi Germany. In his epic anti-A.I. work from the mid-1970s, “Computer Power and Human Reason,” Mr. Weizenbaum described the scene at computer labs. “Bright young men of disheveled appearance, often with sunken glowing eyes, can be seen sitting at computer consoles, their arms tensed and waiting to fire their fingers, already poised to strike, at the buttons and keys on which their attention seems to be as riveted as a gambler’s on the rolling dice,” he wrote. “They exist, at least when so engaged, only through and for the computers. These are computer bums, compulsive programmers.” He was concerned about them as young students lacking perspective about life and was worried that these troubled souls could be our new leaders. Neither Mr. Weizenbaum nor Mr. McCarthy mentioned, though it was hard to miss, that this ascendant generation were nearly all white men with a strong preference for people just like themselves. In a word, they were incorrigible, accustomed to total control of what appeared on their screens. “No playwright, no stage director, no emperor, however powerful,” Mr. Weizenbaum wrote, “has ever exercised such absolute authority to arrange a stage or a field of battle and to command such unswervingly dutiful actors or troops.” Welcome to Silicon Valley, 2017. As Mr. Weizenbaum feared, the current tech leaders have discovered that people trust computers and have licked their lips at the possibilities. The examples of Silicon Valley manipulation are too legion to list: push notifications, surge pricing, recommended friends, suggested films, people who bought this also bought that. Early on, Facebook realized there was a hurdle to getting people to stay logged on. “We came upon this magic number that you needed to find 10 friends,” Mr. Zuckerberg recalled in 2011. “And once you had 10 friends, you had enough content in your newsfeed that there would just be stuff on a good enough interval where it would be worth coming back to the site.” Facebook would design its site for new arrivals so that it was all about finding people to “friend.” The 10 friends rule is an example of a favored manipulation of tech companies, the network effect. People will use your service — as lame as it may be — if others use your service. This was tautological reasoning that nonetheless proved true: If everyone is on Facebook, then everyone is on Facebook. You need to do whatever it takes to keep people logging in, and if rivals emerge, they must be crushed or, if stubbornly resilient, acquired. We need to break up these online monopolies because if a few people make the decisions about how we communicate, shop, learn the news, again, do we control our own society? Growth becomes the overriding motivation — something treasured for its own sake, not for anything it brings to the world. Facebook and Google can point to a greater utility that comes from being the central repository of all people, all information, but such market dominance has obvious drawbacks, and not just the lack of competition. As we’ve seen, the extreme concentration of wealth and power is a threat to our democracy by making some people and companies unaccountable. In addition to their power, tech companies have a tool that other powerful industries don’t: the generally benign feelings of the public. To oppose Silicon Valley can appear to be opposing progress, even if progress has been defined as online monopolies; propaganda that distorts elections; driverless cars and trucks that threaten to erase the jobs of millions of people; the Uberization of work life, where each of us must fend for ourselves in a pitiless market. As is becoming obvious, these companies do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. We need greater regulation, even if it impedes the introduction of new services. If we can’t stop their proposals — if we can’t say that driverless cars may not be a worthy goal, to give just one example — then are we in control of our society? We need to break up these online monopolies because if a few people make the decisions about how we communicate, shop, learn the news, again, do we control our own society?
0~Jared Kushner Puts Himself in Middle of Trump's Chaotic Coronavirus Response~WASHINGTON — Peter T. Gaynor, the federal government’s top emergency manager, was about to go on television last week to announce that he would use wartime production powers to ensure the manufacture of about 60,000 desperately needed coronavirus test kits. With minutes until the camera went live, though, he still had to let the White House know. The person he hurriedly called: Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, who endorsed an announcement that surprised many officials. Among those unaware that Mr. Kushner had agreed to the use of the special powers? President Trump. At one of the most perilous moments in modern American history, Mr. Kushner is trying in a disjointed White House to marshal the forces of government for the war his father-in-law says he is waging. A real estate developer with none of the medical expertise of a public health official nor the mobilization experience of a general, Mr. Kushner has nonetheless become a key player in the response to the pandemic. Because of his unique status, he has made himself the point of contact for many agency officials who know that he can force action and issue decisions without going to the president. But while Mr. Kushner and his allies say that he has brought more order to the process, the government’s response remains fragmented and behind the curve.
0~Elliott Abrams, Neoconservative Who Rejected Trump, May Serve Him~WASHINGTON — Elliott Abrams, a neoconservative who has long argued for an activist foreign policy that spreads American values around the world, was advising Republicans just last spring to “keep your distance” from Donald J. Trump and offering advice about what the party should do after the “Trump collapse.” On Tuesday, Mr. Abrams is set to visit President Trump in the White House to determine whether there is a job for him in the new administration, as the State Department’s No. 2 official. As part of the vetting process to see whether Mr. Abrams will serve as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s deputy, his writings have been scrutinized in a White House suspicious of anyone who was not a Trump loyalist from the beginning. But the advantage of picking Mr. Abrams is clear: He knows the inner workings of the department, he served under Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and, like Mr. Trump, he is often a critic of the Washington foreign policy establishment. Of course, he is also a member of it.
0~Who Is a Seminole, and Who Gets to Decide?~In 1999, the federal appeals court in Denver reversed that ruling and said the trial court had to decide whether in ''good conscience'' the case should proceed even without the tribe. The trial judge in that case had taken no new action when the battle grew more heated with last summer's referendum stripping the black Seminoles of tribal membership. After the referendum passed, the Interior Department declared that this disenfranchisement was illegal and said the department would not recognize any tribal government that did not include the black Seminoles. Eventually, that action could mean the federal government could freeze payment of federal funds to the tribe. In October, the tribe responded with its own suit against the Interior Department in federal court in Washington. In December, with the Seminoles in court because of their own suit, the lawyers for the black Seminoles filed to enter the case, asking the federal court in Washington to use the Seminoles' case as a route around the sovereign immunity barrier. They asked the court in Washington to declare once and for all not only whether the black Seminoles were members of the tribe but also whether they should share the $56 million. This month, the tribe's lawyers filed papers in that suit arguing, among other things, that it was ''pure fiction'' for the black Seminoles to suggest the vote to exclude them from the tribe was related to the $56 million fund. Instead, the tribe said, it was part of a broader reorganization of the tribe's government structure. The court in Washington has yet to rule on the black Seminoles' request. But here in Oklahoma, some of the black Seminoles said that whatever happens in court, the racial harmony of their ancestors may be lost forever. ''It takes your pride away,'' said Donnell E. Davis, Roosevelt Davis's 18-year-old grandson. ''You know they don't want you to be part of them. They tell you you're nothing to them.''
0~An Adaptation From ‘Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,’ by Michael Lewis~The simplest way to design a stock exchange that could not be gamed was to hire the very people best able to game it and encourage them to take their best shots. Katsuyama didn’t know any other national puzzle champions, but Puz did. The only problem was that none of them had ever worked inside a stock exchange. “The Puzzle Masters needed a guide,” Katsuyama says. Enter Constantine Sokoloff, who had helped build Nasdaq’s matching engine — the computer that matched buyers and sellers. Sokoloff was Russian, born and raised in a city on the Volga River. He had an explanation for why so many of his countrymen wound up in high-frequency trading. The old Soviet educational system channeled people into math and science. And the Soviet-controlled economy was horrible and complicated but riddled with loopholes, an environment that left those who mastered it well prepared for Wall Street in the early 21st century. “We had this system for 70 years,” Sokoloff says. “The more you cultivate a class of people who know how to work around the system, the more people you will have who know how to do it well.” The Puzzle Masters might not have thought of it this way at first, but in trying to design their exchange so that investors who came to it would remain safe from predatory traders, they were also divining the ways in which high-frequency traders stalked their prey. For example, these traders had helped the public stock exchanges create all sorts of complicated “order types.” The New York Stock Exchange, for one, had created an order type that traded only if the order on the other side of it was smaller than itself — the purpose of which seemed to be to protect high-frequency traders from buying a small number of shares from an investor who was about to depress the market in these shares with a huge sale. As they worked through the order types, the Puzzle Masters created a taxonomy of predatory behavior in the stock market. Broadly speaking, it appeared as if there were three activities that led to a vast amount of grotesquely unfair trading. The first they called electronic front-running — seeing an investor trying to do something in one place and racing ahead of him to the next (what had happened to Katsuyama when he traded at RBC). The second they called rebate arbitrage — using the new complexity to game the seizing of whatever legal kickbacks, called rebates within the industry, the exchange offered without actually providing the liquidity that the rebate was presumably meant to entice. The third, and probably by far the most widespread, they called slow-market arbitrage. This occurred when a high-frequency trader was able to see the price of a stock change on one exchange and pick off orders sitting on other exchanges before those exchanges were able to react. This happened all day, every day, and very likely generated more billions of dollars a year than the other strategies combined. All three predatory strategies depended on speed. It was Katsuyama who had the crude first idea to counter them: Everyone was fighting to get in as close to the exchange as possible — why not push them as far away as possible? Put ourselves at a distance, but don’t let anyone else be there. The idea was to locate their exchange’s matching engine at some meaningful distance from the place traders connected to the exchange (called the point of presence) and to require anyone who wanted to trade to connect to the exchange at that point of presence. If you placed every participant in the market far enough away from the exchange, you could eliminate most, and maybe all, of the advantages created by speed. Their matching engine, they already knew, would be located in Weehawken (where they’d been offered cheap space in a data center). The only question was: Where to put the point of presence? “Let’s put it in Nebraska,” someone said, but they all knew it would be harder to get the already reluctant Wall Street banks to connect to their market if the banks had to send people to Omaha to do it. Actually, though, it wasn’t necessary for anyone to move to Nebraska. The delay needed only to be long enough for their new exchange, once it executed some part of a customer’s buy order, to beat high-frequency traders in a race to the shares at any other exchange — that is, to prevent electronic front-running. The necessary delay turned out to be 320 microseconds; that was the time it took them, in the worst case, to send a signal to the exchange farthest from them, the New York Stock Exchange in Mahwah. Just to be sure, they rounded it up to 350 microseconds. To create the 350-microsecond delay, they needed to keep the new exchange roughly 38 miles from the place the brokers were allowed to connect to the exchange. That was a problem. Having cut one very good deal to put the exchange in Weehawken, they were offered another: to establish the point of presence in a data center in Secaucus. The two data centers were less than 10 miles apart and already populated by other stock exchanges and all the high-frequency stock-market traders. (“We’re going into the lion’s den,” Ryan said.) A bright idea came from a new employee, James Cape, who had just joined them from a high-frequency-trading firm: Coil the fiber. Instead of running straight fiber between the two places, why not coil 38 miles of fiber and stick it in a compartment the size of a shoe box to simulate the effects of the distance. And that’s what they did. Creating fairness was remarkably simple. They would not sell to any one trader or investor the right to put his computers next to the exchange or special access to data from the exchange. They would pay no rebates to brokers or banks that sent orders; instead, they would charge both sides of any trade the same amount: nine one-hundredths of a cent per share (known as nine mils). They’d allow just three order types: market, limit and Mid-Point Peg, which meant that the investor’s order rested in between the current bid and offer of any stock. If the shares of Procter & Gamble were quoted in the wider market at 80–80.02 (you can buy at $80.02 or sell at $80), a Mid-Point Peg order would trade only at $80.01. “It’s kind of like the fair price,” Katsuyama says.
0~Libeskind Design Chosen for Rebuilding at Ground Zero~"Two people who took part in the steering committee meeting said that both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg supported Mr. Libeskind, as did representatives from the Port Authority. Roland W. Betts, the development corporation director who oversaw the site planning effort, supported the Think plan but agreed to the group's consensus. Two people who took part in the committee's discussion yesterday said Mr. Bloomberg, who earlier this month said he favored Mr. Libeskind's design, was not impressed with the changes made by the Think team, particularly in the ground-level aspects of its design. Throughout the process, city officials have stressed their belief that a plan for the site must contribute to an active street life downtown. Mr. Pataki has repeatedly said that his focus in the rebuilding process is on the memorial to the victims of the attack, and from the beginning he has said he was moved by Mr. Libeskind's design. Many family members of victims have also favored Mr. Libeskind's preservation of so much of the site, and Mr. Pataki has sided with the desires of family members several times, as when he proclaimed last summer that nothing would be built on the ground where the two towers had stood. Mr. Viñoly said that he was not told much yesterday about the reasoning behind the decision. ""But as far as I'm concerned, that is one of the situations in which our profession often finds itself,"" he said. ""These things happen all the time, and you have to go on and do your work."" Two state officials said last night that they feared the governor could face some negative political fallout from the decision. The development corporation's site committee voted on Tuesday to endorse the Think plan; those board members were appointed by Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bloomberg and former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Thus these elected officials overruled their own appointees, appointees who were charged specifically with carrying out the rebuilding. But Mr. Libeskind's design, focusing on the pit and its bleak walls, has sustained a groundswell of support that began almost as soon as it was unveiled in December. The exposed concrete walls of the excavated pit, purely functional when built and designed to hold back the subterranean waters of the Hudson River, came in Mr. Libeskind's design to represent the foundations of democracy, standing fast under the onslaught of a swift and terrifying enemy. The selection of a winning design is the culmination of a nine-month process that began last May. While the first phase of the rebuilding process is largely complete, much work remains to be done before anything resembling new development takes place at the World Trade Center site."
0~On Trade, the U.S. and China Consider the Unthinkable: Breaking Up~“If you look at what’s happening with trade in China, it hasn’t been fair for many, many years.” When President Trump rails against China, he says things like, “Our country is being taken advantage of,” or, “We lost years ago by presidents and others allowing this to happen.” He’s probably referring to the past four decades, when China has grown faster than any major economy in history and gone from a poor, developing country to an economic powerhouse that is challenging America’s spot at the top of the international food chain. “Its emergence as a global power was so sharp and so extreme, faster than the world can handle, in some ways faster than China can handle.” The U.S. and other Western nations kick-started much of China’s rise by opening up trade. What they haven’t figured out is how to get this fundamentally different economic system to play by free market rules. A pivotal moment came in 2001 after 15 years of negotiations. China joined the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for free and fair trade between member countries. “All of the countries that were in the club at the time put enormous demands on China for what they needed to do.” The Chinese committed to sharply lower tariffs and reduced some of the government’s role in how business gets done. But they argued then, as they still do now, that China is a developing country and so should be held to less stringent free trade standards. The hope was that these first steps would lead to even more sweeping changes. “Why did we assume that? The experience of communism was through the lens of the Soviet Union and its satellite states, which was ultimately not a success. And so the presumption was, China’s going to want to become like us, more market oriented.” “After China joined the W.T.O. in 2001, you saw this enormous surge of Chinese exports to everywhere in the world, and to the United States in particular.” “They were kind of an elephant hiding behind mice with respect to other countries in global trade negotiations at the time.” The U.S. and other countries complained that China was not opening its markets enough, and keeping the value of its currency artificially low to make Chinese exports more attractive. “China has been making great strides using tools that are really not acceptable under the global trade system.” China has continued to operate as a centrally planned economy. The government owns, influences or subsidizes major industries, giving them an artificial competitive edge. There are heavy restrictions on foreign investment, and foreign companies are pressured to share their technologies. “China has become more market oriented, but dating back to probably 2007, 2008, I think it was recognized that China wasn’t on the path to become more like us. And so then countries began to think about, well, what do we do instead?” “Some view the rise of Asia-Pacific with suspicion and fear. America doesn’t.” Enter the Trans-Pacific Partnership, initiated by Bush, signed by Obama. “When implemented, It won’t just boost trade and support jobs in our 12 countries. It will help set stronger rules for trade across the Asia-Pacific.” Put less politely, It was also supposed to be a bulwark to China’s growing economic power. “The idea was that China would want to join this great trading pact, and so they would have this incentive to reform their economy.” “This is the one that President Trump ripped up on his third day in office.” “The first one is withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.” “I had seen the erosion of popular and congressional support for trade for many years. But I’d never seen anything like Donald Trump.” “Our founding fathers understood trade much better than our current politicians, believe me.” Trade is generally accepted by economists as win-win for countries on the whole. But Trump says that China is winning and the U.S. is losing. “He and people in his administration argue that past approaches to dealing with China haven’t worked. It’s not actually that profitable to negotiate with them. We need to focus on this much bigger trade measure, and then we can really hit them with a very aggressive, forceful action.” “He seems intent on generating a moment of crisis.” “We put a $50 billion tariff on, then we put a $100 billion tariff on. And you know at a certain point, they run out of bullets.” But dynamics have changed. Today, China sees its economy as strong enough to withstand almost anything the U.S. can throw at it.
0~Chinese Film Director Fined for Exceeding Child Limits~HONG KONG — China’s most internationally known film director, Zhang Yimou, and his wife were ordered by a government office on Thursday to pay a $1.24 million fine for violating family planning limits by having three children. A district family planning bureau in Wuxi, a lakeside city in eastern China where Mr. Zhang’s wife, Chen Ting, officially resides, announced the 7.49 million renminbi fine for “seriously” violating the rules, the China News Service, a state-run agency, reported. The penalty followed months of speculation in the Chinese news media about how many children Mr. Zhang had fathered, why he had apparently eluded the rules that limit most urban couples to one child, and why officials in Wuxi had found it impossible to track down one of the country’s most recognizable faces. The officials went to Beijing to try to find the couple and wrote to them more than 10 times, the China News Service said, citing an unnamed family planning official in the city. “There was never any effective response, and this created some difficulty for investigating and collecting evidence,” the China News Service report said. “When the couple had the three children, they had not carried out marriage registration procedures and did not obtain birth permit documents from the population and family planning authorities.”
0~‘True Detective’ on HBO Stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey~Shows he deeply admired, like “The Sopranos,” “The Wire” and “Deadwood,” made him realize that his hunger for fiction was being fed more fulsomely by television than by the contemporary novels he was reading. In 2010, Scribner published his first novel, “Galveston,” and a nibble came from Hollywood looking to adapt that crime noir set in Louisiana and Texas. Making good on a promise to his wife that he would move her and their daughter to California to pursue his television dream if he got the chance, he asked his Hollywood agents how he could break into the business. Write a spec script and one original work, he was told. Mr. Pizzolatto churned out six scripts, including what would be the pilot episode of “True Detective.” His efforts got him hired as a writer on the American version of “The Killing.” Then came the bidding war for “True Detective.” Over breakfast, Mr. Pizzolatto recalled how “True Detective” actually began life as a novel. Television enabled him better to portray the different time periods of the show — 1995, when Mr. McConaughey and Mr. Harrelson’s characters investigate the murder, and 2012, when a separate pair of detectives deconstruct their investigation. And the medium allowed him to make explicit one of the rules driving his storytelling: “The voice may lie to you, but the image never will. So the audience can see for themselves where reality does not sync up with the story being told. And maybe the reason it doesn’t sync up is because it’s nothing nefarious. It’s the slipperiness of memory. It’s how we recolor the past with our own present desires and needs for rationale. And those kinds of explorations are the things I’m interested in and am obsessed about.” The mismatched cops and the ritual murder are just means to that end. “I think of genre as a marketing tool,” he said.
0~Remdesivir Coronavirus Trial: Federal Scientists Finally Publish Data~Nearly a month after federal scientists claimed that an experimental drug had helped patients severely ill with the coronavirus, the research has been published. The drug, remdesivir, was quickly authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of coronavirus patients, and hospitals rushed to obtain supplies. But until now, researchers and physicians had not seen the actual data. And remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences, has a spotty history. It was originally intended to treat hepatitis, but it failed to. It was tested against Ebola, but results were lackluster. So far, remdesivir has not been officially approved for any purpose. The F.D.A.’s emergency use authorization was not a formal approval.
0~Book Review: ‘Troubled,’ by Kenneth R. Rosen~As soon as she comes home, Hazel reverts to her former self, and her problems continue for years. This is also true of Rosen’s next subject, Avery, a child-abuse victim whose godmother promised her a shopping spree to get her in the car before dropping her at a wilderness program that preceded her time at Academy at Swift River, a residential therapeutic boarding school that is styled like a little prep school, but that Rosen characterizes as a brainwashing mill, where participants “are taught to give up their control over their lives — their appearance, their physical possessions — in order to be made whole.” Avery witnesses a suicide attempt (the girl is whisked away, her fate never revealed to the others), and a boy then accuses her of rule-breaking, before she finally learns to play the game — to snitch on other participants to prove her own progress. Avery leaves Swift River feeling optimistic, but that feeling doesn’t last. “If you’re sent away to a program,” another former participant tells Rosen, “then you label yourself in your head that, OK, I’m a troubled teen, and it’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy.” Rosen’s final two subjects are brothers, Mike and Mark, whose drug- and violence-fueled teenage years bring them both to the Academy at Ivy Ridge, which closed in 2009 after allegations of false imprisonment, child abuse and gross negligence. Here, too, both brothers are supposed to be scared straight, though Rosen shows how Ivy Ridge “focused more heavily on instilling the idea that the clients themselves were the problem.” By now, we know what will happen. The brothers will muddle through, only to link back up with their old lives further scarred, “in a state of constant flux, like they cannot escape their adolescence.” Reporting on these places is difficult. Most parents are not interested in talking with a reporter about sending off their kids to such programs — and the programs aren’t either. Springing up without any connection to established hospitals or institutions, the tough-love industry, we also learn, is phenomenally lucrative. (Rosen cites one company, Universal Health Services Inc., with a behavioral health division with revenues of $3.4 billion.) Some places are well intentioned but slapdash, while the worst have been driven out of business by prosecutors. (Swift River and Adirondack Leadership Expeditions were part of an entity controlled by Bain Capital, which shut them both down in 2013.) But Rosen reports that some 5,000 kids are still admitted into wilderness programs each year. According to him, even the industry’s recognized trade group, National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs, doesn’t articulate or enforce standards of care — it just offers what Rosen argues is a self-reinforcing “ineffective accreditation network.” While he doesn’t make the comparison himself, it sometimes seems Rosen is arguing that these programs are almost like gay conversion therapy: a ludicrous, damaging response to something that might never have been a problem to begin with. This raises a question — what viable alternatives did their families have? Rosen isn’t entirely unsympathetic to them. When, more recently, he witnesses Mark in a fresh crisis, he writes: “I felt the anguish of my parents. I did not know what to do. I wanted to help, and that desire counted for nothing.” Another question hovers over much of “Troubled”: Did the programs cause these kids’ problems or simply fail to address problems that existed already? Rosen argues that the trauma of scaring a kid straight ends up scarring them for life, making them feel like outsiders, like they’re broken. “It distances them more from the world they’re meant to join,” he writes. You could say that the author himself is living proof that these programs sometimes do work. He would not agree. After all this time, he continues to live his life on a knife’s edge. “Far as I can tell,” he writes, “I never really shed that troubled past. I disrespect authority figures. I make risky financial decisions. I test the limits of my family’s patience. My love of risk still sends me places others would prefer not to go. And I still smile when others ask about it all.”
0~N.F.L. Begins Moves to Avoid Another Labor War~In an opportunistic move that could maximize its media revenue, the N.F.L. has begun its push for a new labor agreement with the N.F.L. Players Association even though the current deal does not expire for another year and a half. Executives from the league and the players’ union initiated discussions last month, holding two bargaining sessions that had little of the rancor evident in the last labor dispute, in 2011, when the league tried to claw back roughly $1 billion in revenue from its players and locked them out for four months. The current deal does not expire until after the 2020 season, but getting a new one would put the league in the strongest possible position to begin negotiations for new contracts with its media partners, who pay the league about $7 billion annually. Most of the N.F.L.’s media agreements expire after the 2022 season, and the league has not yet opened negotiations for new contracts. But with the media landscape fracturing and shifting away from the broadcast and cable industries, which have proved so lucrative for the N.F.L., league executives are hoping labor certainty will help deliver another windfall.

Trump at Thursday’s debate, all but pleading with Republicans to abandon a candidate with a long history of business failures, deep ties to the Democratic Party and a taste for personal insults. Warning that Mr. Trump would lead the party to a historic defeat in November, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz delivered their attacks with urgency, as if trying to awaken voters who had fallen under Mr. Trump’s spell. Mr. Rubio derided Mr. Trump as untrustworthy and uncivil, while Mr. Cruz bashed him for donating money to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign and to other Democrats. Mr. Trump looked on with disgust, but as in their 10 previous debates, he seemed impervious and perhaps unstoppable. At times, the face-off in Detroit also deteriorated into the kind of junior high school taunts that have startled many Republican elders but have done little to dent Mr. Trump’s broad appeal. As Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio traded insults over their manhood, Mr. Trump recalled Mr. Rubio’s innuendo that Mr. Trump’s “small hands” correlated with another part of his anatomy. Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his sexual exploits, insisted that nothing was small about him. “I guarantee you,” he continued with little subtlety, “there’s no problem. I guarantee you.”
0~Jeffrey Epstein’s Will: He Signed 2 Days Before Killing Himself~ST. THOMAS, V.I. — Less than 48 hours before Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself, he was preparing for death: He had just signed his will, according to court documents filed on Monday in the Virgin Islands. Mr. Epstein was found early on Saturday, Aug. 10, after he had ended his life with a bedsheet he had tied to his bunk in a federal jail cell in Manhattan. Left behind were scores of anguished accusers, a universe of unanswered questions and a $500 million fortune, which he ordered placed in a hastily arranged trust. “The 1953 Trust,” apparently named for Mr. Epstein’s birth year, was established the same day the will was signed — two days before he was found dead in his cramped cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center. “In witness whereof, I have duly executed this will, 8 day of August 2019,” Mr. Epstein wrote, followed by a small, looping blue signature.
0~Africa’s Gift to Silicon Valley: How to Track a Crisis~Could wiki technology find Osama bin Laden? Imagine if any Pakistani could send an anonymous text message to the authorities suggesting where to look. Each location could be plotted on a map. The dots would be scattered widely, perhaps, with promising leads indistinguishable from rubbish. But on a given day, a surge of dots might point to the same village, in what could not be coincidence. Troops could be ordered in. This kind of everyone-as-informant mapping is shaking up the world, bringing the Wikipedia revolution to the work of humanitarians and soldiers who parachute into places with little good information. And an important force behind this upheaval is a small Kenyan-born organization called Ushahidi, which has become a hero of the Haitian and Chilean earthquakes and which may have something larger to tell us about the future of humanitarianism, innovation and the nature of what we label as truth. After Kenya’s disputed election in 2007, violence erupted. A prominent Kenyan lawyer and blogger, Ory Okolloh, who was based in South Africa but had gone back to Kenya to vote and observe the election, received threats about her work and returned to South Africa. She posted online the idea of an Internet mapping tool to allow people anonymously to report violence and other misdeeds. Technology whizzes saw her post and built the Ushahidi Web platform over a long weekend.
0~Dylann Roof, Addressing Court, Offers No Apology or Explanation for Massacre~CHARLESTON, S.C. — Seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life, the convicted killer Dylann S. Roof stood on Wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology, no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a Bible study session in June 2015. Instead, in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial, Mr. Roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill — undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor — and left it at that. “Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn’t and the fact that I’m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who’s ever existed, there’s nothing wrong with me psychologically,” Mr. Roof, who is representing himself, told the jury, which found him guilty last month of the killings at Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Three minutes after walking to the lectern, Mr. Roof returned to the defense table, exhaling deeply.
0~How Andy Jassy, Amazon’s Next C.E.O., Was a ‘Brain Double’ for Jeff Bezos~Few corporate successions will be watched as closely. Mr. Jassy must steer Amazon — which has mushroomed into a $1.7 trillion company with 1.3 million employees and worldwide operations in e-commerce, logistics, cloud computing, entertainment and devices — while under the watchful eye of Mr. Bezos, who remains the biggest shareholder. Amazon, which has been riding a wave of growth, also faces mounting challenges. In Europe and the United States, the Seattle-based company is under scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers for its power. Its own work force has become increasingly vocal and active in dealing with the company. And with its sheer size, some investors and employees wonder whether Amazon can maintain its innovative ways without bureaucracy bogging it down. Mr. Jassy has not spoken publicly about his vision for Amazon, but those who know him said what was clear was that he would continue what Mr. Bezos had built — and not make a sharp break from it. The epitome of an Amazon lifer, Mr. Jassy helped conceive and proselytize many of the company’s mechanisms and internal culture. “Andy is very much part of the whole culture,” said Tom Alberg, a managing partner at Madrona Venture Group and an Amazon board member until 2019. “I really do think it will be a strong continuation.” Amazon declined to make Mr. Jassy available for an interview. In an email to employees on Tuesday announcing the transition, Mr. Bezos said, “He will be an outstanding leader, and he has my full confidence.”
0~Demi Lovato Is Said to Be Hospitalized for Drug Overdose~Demi Lovato, the Grammy-nominated pop singer known for her big voice and confessional nature, was rushed to a Los Angeles area hospital on Tuesday afternoon after experiencing what the authorities said was a drug overdose, according to news reports. Representatives for the Los Angeles Police and Fire Departments said that officers responded just before noon local time to a medical emergency in the Hollywood Hills. Paramedics transported a 25-year-old woman in stable condition to the hospital, a Fire Department spokesman said, though the authorities declined to identify the person. TMZ and NBC News reported that the patient was Ms. Lovato, 25, who has frequently discussed her struggles with substance abuse in both music and interviews. Kerissa Webb Dunn, an aunt of Ms. Lovato, wrote on Facebook: “PLEASE PLEASE pray for my sweet niece DEMI LOVATO. She has been hospitalized and needs everyone’s prayers desperately!!!! PLEASE PRAY she pulls through.” She added later that Ms. Lovato was “awake and responsive.”
0~Trump’s Travel Ban Is Upheld by Supreme Court~The 5-to-4 decision upholding President Trump’s travel ban basically did two things. The majority said that the president had been given vast authority over immigration and national security by Congress and that he acted consistent with that authority. The second thing it did was reject the claim that the travel ban was infected by religious discrimination. “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” The majority discounted the president’s statements and said the role of the courts was to look at the face of the presidential proclamation issued in September, and that proclamation, the court said, was lawful. The Supreme Court has occasionally looked at the scope of presidential power, and it’s gone both ways. It imposed some limits on President George W. Bush’s ability to hold people in Guantánamo Bay. It rejected President Truman’s attempt to seize the steel industry during the Korean War. And it forced President Nixon to turn over tapes concerning the Watergate scandal that led to his departure from office. The crux of the argument against the travel ban was based on President Trump’s tweets and statements on the campaign trail and in office, in which he suggested that he was singling out Muslims for discriminatory treatment. In the lower courts and now at the Supreme Court, there was a strong partisan divide, with every Republican appointee voting to sustain the travel ban and every Democratic appointee in dissent. The majority opinion gave rise to a very striking dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who spoke at length in the Supreme Court courtroom about the terrible precedent the majority set and how it resonated with some of the darkest periods in American history, notably the internment of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. The decision was a major statement on presidential power in the area of immigration and national security, but it didn’t break new ground. The ruling had no particular practical impact because months ago, the Supreme Court allowed the travel ban to go into effect while it considered the case. What it did instead was decline to impose special legal rules on an idiosyncratic president who speaks in ways that are unfamiliar to American traditions and to say that it was considering the presidency and not President Trump in ruling on his travel ban.
0~For a Trump Fan, a Week When Victory Ebbed Away~“I’m just tired of all the arguing that people are doing,” she said. “I wish sometimes Trump would just say — he doesn’t even have to mean it — that he would be the president for everybody. Just say those words.” Monday, Nov. 2 In the last hours of the campaign, Ms. Rocco’s confidence in Mr. Trump’s victory had begun to buckle. Late into the night, when he gave his final speech at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., she was surprised to find herself weeping. “It was sad that it could be his last rally,” she said. “It could be that he could not be president anymore.” Tuesday, Nov. 3 At 7 on election night, the Roccos settled themselves on the sofa to watch the returns. Ms. Rocco was stress-eating Halloween candy, KitKats and Smarties. They had passed the last hours of the campaign on a dark roadside outside a polling station, fingers frozen, waving Trump flags at passing vehicles. Mr. Rocco muttered to himself, “Me standing out here is kind of pointless.” But then he reminded himself what kept him out there all these months: People had disrespected him. The Facebook group manager who had kicked him off. The neighbor who took his yard sign. Teachers who responded to his daughter’s enthusiasm about Mr. Trump with awkward silence.

0~ALBRIGHT GREETED WITH A FANFARE BY NORTH KOREA~Distance between the two countries was ''no barrier to closer ties,'' she added. Campaigning today in New York, Mr. Clinton said, ''We have some hope of resolving our outstanding differences with North Korea and looking forward to the day when they will truly close the last chapter in the aftermath of the Korean War.'' Many aspects of events in North Korea today, like the sudden planning of Dr. Albright's trip itself, were filled with unexpected twists and turns, apparently a technique that Mr. Kim likes to use with his guests. The incongruity of Dr. Albright, who has made democracy a leitmotif, applauding a mass propaganda show dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the Korean Workers Party, was most likely lost on her hosts. But there were several images in the show that must have unnerved Dr. Albright, including one depicting the launch of a long-range ballistic missile, superimposed on the wall of the stadium in front of her. The missile is the very weapon that Dr. Albright has come to persuade the North Koreans to abandon. Most of the audience were men in dark suits with red lapel pins showing Mr. Kim and most were members of the Communist Party. Many in the audience looked with a combination of suspicion and awe as a group of Western reporters sat in comfortable green velour chairs in spots usually reserved for special guests. The precision of dancing and gymnastics, and the din of brass and drum music, combined with choral works, made similar efforts at Socialist entertainment by the former Soviet Union and China pale by comparison. The effort took 10 months of rehearsing, said Foreign Ministry officials accompanying foreign reporters, and obviously involved many grueling hours of training for young children. A closing scene titled ''We will support our powerful nation with rifles'' was staged by thousands of men in army uniform who marched in lock step and shouted, ''We will safeguard our dear leader!'' A less threatening dance called ''The leader will always be with us'' involved probably more than a thousand children dressed in white and performing gymnastics in exact formations. Pictures of Dr. Albright chatting amiably with Mr. Kim at the spectacle were used on government television news tonight, in a lead item that stressed the prestige of having such an honored guest attend the show.
0~Players in a New Super League Would Be Barred From the World Cup~According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, plans for the breakaway European Super League, a project that has been discussed for decades, gathered pace since the summer. Top clubs sought to take advantage of uncertainty in the soccer industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic to forge a new path that would insure a degree of financial stability for them but almost certainly lead to a loss in value and revenue for teams excluded from the project. Each of the would-be permanent members are being promised 350 million euros, or $425 million to sign up, the documents said. Under the proposals, the Super League, which would be played in the middle of the week, would have 16 top soccer franchises as permanent members and add four qualifiers from domestic competitions. The clubs would be split into two groups of 10 with the top four teams in each group qualifying for the knockout stages, culminating in a final that would take place on a weekend. The event would, according to the documents, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue for the participating teams, already the richest clubs in the sport. (An alternative version of the plan has 15 permanent members and five qualification spots.) The group has entered into discussions with JPMorgan Chase & Co. to raise financing for the project, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment. The clearest public indication of how advanced the talks among the clubs are came when Josep Maria Bartomeu, the former president of the soccer club Barcelona, announced in October that his team had agreed with the leaders of what he described as Europe’s other “big clubs” to participate in a European Super League. Bayern Munich, Germany’s biggest team, spoke out this week against a breakaway, but should other top teams find an agreement it would be unrealistic for that club not to be involved as well. The project has long been the brainchild of Florentino Pérez, the president of Barcelona’s rival Real Madrid. Leaked documents from 2018 revealed he had drawn up plans with a Spanish consultancy for a new competition and then held a meeting with FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, in 2019 to discuss the plans further, telling him that teams from the Super League competition would be willing to participate in FIFA’s expanded World Cup for clubs, a quadrennial event that Infantino believes can become one of the most important properties in all of sports.
0~A Skeptical Stock Analyst Wins Big by Seeking Out Frauds~Last month, federal authorities charged the founder of the electric vehicle manufacturer Nikola, which had gone public in the summer of 2020, with defrauding investors. They were led there partly by the work of a little-known Wall Streeter named Nathan Anderson. A stock researcher and investor, Mr. Anderson and his upstart firm, Hindenburg Research, are having a moment. In early August, the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the sports betting firm DraftKings after Hindenburg said in a June report that it had potentially enabled black-market betting. And shares of Lordstown Motors have fallen nearly 70 percent since Hindenburg said in March that the electric truck maker was hyping commercial interest for its vehicle. Federal authorities are investigating Lordstown’s claims. Mr. Anderson’s five-person firm, which takes its name from the German airship that blew up in 1937, is a newbie in the world of finance. Founded in 2017, Hindenburg specializes in publishing detailed reports about publicly traded companies, poking holes in their stories and alerting investors to potential malfeasance. The boom in special purpose acquisition companies has provided Hindenburg with fertile ground. It’s not an act of public service. Hindenburg, which has the backing of several investors, also makes financial bets that the stocks of the companies Mr. Anderson is targeting will fall after the firm issues its research. When the stocks do fall, Hindenburg makes its money in what is called a “short” trade.
0~As Search Nears End, Florida Condo Death Toll Becomes Clearer~“This work is becoming more difficult with the passage of time,” she said. In addition to the 10 unidentified people who are known to have been in the building, the list of those potentially still missing includes four more names, for a total of 14, said Alfredo Ramirez III, the director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. Those four were identified by friends or family members as possibly in the building when it collapsed, and they have not been found alive elsewhere. If any of their remains are found in the building, the death toll could rise to as high as 99 people, making the fall of the Champlain Towers one of the deadliest structural building failures in U.S. history. In 1981, the year the high-rise was built, walkways at the Kansas City Hyatt Regency in Missouri collapsed, killing 114 people. The number of people unaccounted for in the Surfside ruins has varied widely because so many people reported missing loved ones after the collapse. (The building did not keep a record of who was in it at any given time.) A team of detectives has had to follow up on each tip, calling relatives and scouring databases for information. Some people left incomplete tips and did not provide contact information, leaving detectives with no easy way to confirm if the tip was real. On the day after the collapse, officials said more than 150 people were potentially unaccounted for. Ms. Levine Cava said formal missing persons reports have been filed for 12 of the 14 people who remain unaccounted for. Detectives continue to try to verify the other two names on the list. It is also possible that the list is incomplete, if someone who was in the building has not been reported missing over the past 20 days.
0~Moktada al-Sadr’s Anti-U.S. Forces Poised for Gains in Iraq~AMARA, Iraq — The Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who in the past decade has been both an anti-American insurgency leader and a behind-the-scenes power broker, is not expected to be personally in attendance whenever Iraq’s leaders sketch out a new government. But with his followers standing to gain control of powerful government posts, his influence is likely to become apparent in many facets of Iraqi public life, from the halls of Parliament to the tomato farms and marshlands here in southeastern Iraq. Maysan Province was a stronghold for Mr. Sadr until sweeps by the Iraqi Army in 2008 helped break the grip of his militia forces, and political change ousted his ally from the governorship here last year. Now, the winds are shifting again, and the area has become a stage for Mr. Sadr’s remarkable political resurgence in Iraq after years of schism, military defeats and Mr. Sadr’s own flight to Iran.
0~Hackers Tell the Story of the Twitter Attack From the Inside~Playing a central role in the attack was Kirk, who was taking money in and out of the same Bitcoin address as the day went on, according to an analysis of the Bitcoin transactions by The Times, with assistance from the research firm Chainalysis. But the identity of Kirk, his motivation and whether he shared his access to Twitter with anyone else remain a mystery even to the people who worked with him. It is still unclear how much Kirk used his access to the accounts of people like Mr. Biden and Mr. Musk to gain more privileged information, like their private conversations on Twitter. The hacker “lol” and another one he worked with, who went by the screen name “ever so anxious,” told The Times that they wanted to talk about their work with Kirk in order to prove that they had only facilitated the purchases and takeovers of lesser-known Twitter addresses early in the day. They said they had not continued to work with Kirk once he began more high-profile attacks around 3:30 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. “I just wanted to tell you my story because i think you might be able to clear some thing up about me and ever so anxious,” “lol” said in a chat on Discord, where he shared all the logs of his conversation with Kirk and proved his ownership of the cryptocurrency accounts he used to transact with Kirk. “lol” did not confirm his real-world identity, but said he lived on the West Coast and was in his 20s. “ever so anxious” said he was 19 and lived in the south of England with his mother. Investigators looking into the attacks said several of the details given by the hackers lined up with what they have learned so far, including Kirk’s involvement both in the big hacks later in the day and the lower-profile attacks early on Wednesday. The Times was initially put in touch with the hackers by a security researcher in California, Haseeb Awan, who was communicating with them because, he said, a number of them had previously targeted him and a Bitcoin-related company he once owned. They also unsuccessfully targeted his current company, Efani, a secure phone provider.
0~Dozens of Russians Are Believed Killed in U.S.-Backed Syria Attack~MOSCOW — Four Russian nationals, and perhaps dozens more, were killed in fighting between pro-government forces in eastern Syria and members of the United States-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, according to Russian and Syrian officials. A Syrian military officer said that about 100 Syrian soldiers had been killed in the fighting on Feb. 7 and 8, but news about Russian casualties has dribbled out only slowly, through Russian news organizations and social media. Much about the attack and the associated casualties has been obscured in the fog of war. For reasons that remain unclear, Syrian government troops and some Russian nationals appear to have attacked a coalition position, near Al Tabiyeh, Syria. The attack occurred in the vicinity of Deir al-Zour, a strategic, oil-rich territory that is coveted by the Syrians. Most of the fatalities were attributed to an American airstrike on enemy columns that was called in by American-backed Kurdish soldiers who believed they were under attack.
0~China Bets on Sensitive U.S. Start-Ups, Worrying the Pentagon~Ashton B. Carter, former secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, had tapped Mike A. Brown, the former chief executive of Symantec, the cybersecurity firm, to lead the inquiry into the Chinese investments, according to two of the people aware of the white paper’s contents. A spokesman for the Department of Defense said it “will not discuss the details or components of draft internal working documents.” The size and breadth of the deals are not clear because start-ups and their backers are not obligated to disclose them. Over all, China has been increasingly active in the American start-up world, participating in investment rounds worth $9.9 billion in 2015, according to data from the research firm CB Insights, more than four times the level the year before. Neither the high-tech start-ups nor their Chinese investors have been accused of wrongdoing, and experts said much of the activity could be innocent. Chinese investors have money and are looking for returns, while the Chinese government has pushed investment in ways to clean up China’s skies, upgrade its industrial capacity and unclog its snarled highways. Proponents of the deals said American limits on technology exports would still apply to American start-ups with Chinese backers. But the fund flows fit China’s pattern of using state-guided investment to help its industrial policy and enhance its technology holdings, as it has recently done with semiconductors. China has also carried out efforts to steal military-related technology. Still, some start-ups — especially those making hardware rather than money-drawing mobile apps like Snapchat — said Chinese money was sometimes the only available funding. But even a company struggling for money can ultimately come up with a big breakthrough.
0~Amazon Cites Terms of Use in Expulsion of WikiLeaks~WASHINGTON  Amazon on Thursday defended its decision to expel WikiLeaks from its Web site hosting service this week after an aide to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman called the company and asked about the relationship. In a statement, Amazon  which rents server space to companies in addition to its better-known business of selling books, music and other products online  said that it had canceled its relationship with WikiLeaks not because of “a government inquiry,” but because it decided that the organization was violating the terms of service for the program. “When companies or people go about securing and storing large quantities of data that isn’t rightfully theirs, and publishing this data without ensuring it won’t injure others, it’s a violation of our terms of service, and folks need to go operate elsewhere,” the company said. WikiLeaks, which began making public the first of a cache of more than 250,000 leaked State Department cables this week, apparently moved its Web site to Amazon’s servers in recent weeks after “denial of service” attacks had sought to shut it down.
0~Kenneth H. Brown, Playwright Best Known for ‘The Brig,’ Dies at 85~Kenneth H. Brown, a New York playwright whose acclaimed 1963 Off Off Broadway play “The Brig,” based on his experiences as a Marine, portrayed dehumanization inside a military prison during the Korean War, died on Feb. 5 at a hospice in Queens. He was 85. A friend, the performance artist and writer Penny Arcade, said the cause was cancer. After growing up in Brooklyn in the 1950s as something of a street tough, Mr. Brown, eager to serve his country, enlisted in the Marines at 18. But stationed in Japan, he found himself rattled by military life and was thrown into the brig for insubordination. There, by his account, he was humiliated and abused. Guards called him “maggot”; he was punched in the gut for even minor infractions. Mornings started with garbage-can lids being banged on bunk beds, and he and his fellow inmates were ordered to jog around their claustrophobic quarters for hours until they were breathless. “I was always in trouble in the Marines,” he said in an interview with the Lower East Side Biography Project. “I went to the brig twice. The first time I did 25 days.” Of his military service, he said, “By the time I got out, I was a complete pacifist.”

0~Poland Reverses Supreme Court Purge, Retreating From Conflict With E.U.~WARSAW — Backing down from a showdown with Brussels, Poland’s government reversed its purge of the country’s Supreme Court, as the president signed a law on Monday that will reinstate the judges who had been forced out of their jobs. It was a remarkable turnaround after months of Poland’s top officials saying they would resist pressure to stop the overhaul of the judiciary. The ruling party, Law and Justice, had put tightening its grip on the courts at the center of its agenda, claiming that it was vital to rid the courts of corrupt judges and Communist-era vestiges. The European Union sees the changes Poland has made to its judiciary in the last three years as a violation of the bloc’s core values, a threat to the rule of law and the end of judges acting as a check on political power. Last year, the union chastised Poland and took the first steps toward stripping the country of its voting rights in Brussels — a penalty that has never been used against a member nation. Poland’s concession on the Supreme Court is by no means the end of that conflict between the right-wing, nationalist Polish government and Brussels, but it represented a striking change in tone.
0~For Myanmar’s Army, Ethnic Bloodletting Is Key to Power and Riches~YANGON, Myanmar — For Myanmar’s army, the campaign of atrocity it has waged to drive hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims out of the country is no innovation. The force was born in blood 76 years ago and has been shedding it ever since. Its founders, known as the Thirty Comrades, established the army in 1941 with a ghoulish ceremony in Bangkok, where they drew each other’s blood with a single syringe, mixed it in a silver bowl and drank it to seal their vow of loyalty. The army that they formed led the nation to independence in 1948. But except for a brief, initial period of peace, it has spent the last seven decades warring with its own people. The army, known as the Tatmadaw, seized power from the civilian government in Burma, as the country is also known, in 1962. The military killed thousands of protesters to keep power in 1988 and suppressed another popular uprising, the Saffron Revolution, in 2007.
0~Zhou Yongkang, Former Security Chief in China, Faces Corruption Trial~HONG KONG — The former head of China’s law-and-order apparatus, Zhou Yongkang, will stand trial on charges of bribery, abusing power and disclosing state secrets, the country’s top prosecution office announced on Friday, making Mr. Zhou the highest-ranked Communist Party official to be indicted on graft charges. The statement from the prosecution office, which oversees major corruption inquiries, indicated that Mr. Zhou had little hope of clemency, noting that his misdeeds were “particularly grave.” Mr. Zhou is the most powerful figure yet to have been singled out by President Xi Jinping’s campaign to eradicate corruption. The prosecution office said his crimes spanned much of his career as a party official, from his time as an oil executive to his five-year tenure on the Politburo Standing Committee, when he wielded immense power through overseeing the courts, the police, domestic security forces and the state intelligence apparatus. The announcement Friday did not give a date for Mr. Zhou’s trial, which will be in Tianjin, a northern port city near Beijing.
0~What Happened at the Capitol Yesterday~Just after 1 p.m., when President Trump ended his speech to protesters in Washington by calling for them to march on Congress, hundreds of echoing calls to storm the building were made by his supporters online. On social media sites used by the far-right, such as Gab and Parler, directions on which streets to take to avoid the police and which tools to bring to help pry open doors were exchanged in comments. At least a dozen people posted about carrying guns into the halls of Congress. Calls for violence against members of Congress and for pro-Trump movements to retake the Capitol building have been circulating online for months. Bolstered by Mr. Trump, who has courted fringe movements like QAnon and the Proud Boys, groups have openly organized on social media networks and recruited others to their cause. On Wednesday, their online activism became real-world violence, leading to unprecedented scenes of mobs freely strolling through the halls of Congress and uploading celebratory photographs of themselves, encouraging others to join them. On Gab, they documented going into the offices of members of Congress, including that of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Dozens posted about searching for Vice President Mike Pence, who had been the target of Mr. Trump’s ire earlier in the day. At 2:24 p.m., after Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done,” dozens of messages on Gab called for those inside the Capitol building to hunt down the vice president. In videos uploaded to the channel, protesters could be heard chanting “Where is Pence?” As Facebook and Twitter began to crack down groups like QAnon and the Proud Boys over the summer, they slowly migrated to other sites that allowed them to openly call for violence. Renee DiResta, a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory who studies online movements, said the violence Wednesday was the result of online movements operating in closed social media networks where people believed the claims of voter fraud and of the election being stolen from Mr. Trump. “These people are acting because they are convinced an election was stolen,” DiResta said. “This is a demonstration of the very real-world impact of echo chambers.” She added: “This has been a striking repudiation of the idea that there is an online and an offline world and that what is said online is in some way kept online.”

Then came the Mill fire Warehouse Moratorium: As warehouse construction balloons nationwide, residents in communities both rural and urban have pushed back. In California’s Inland Empire, As warehouse construction balloons nationwide, residents in communities both rural and urban have pushed back. In California’s Inland Empire, the anger has turned to widespread action Mahogany Taylor, a 39-year-old mother of two and the president of the San Diego Unified Council of PTAs, said the loss of in-person instruction was particularly destructive for elementary school students — many of whom cannot type — and for low-income students, who often lack internet access, and who make up nearly 60 percent of San Diego Unified’s students. At the same time, Ms. Taylor said, a districtwide survey showed that 40 percent of parents already were planning to insist on remote instruction. “We obviously believe that school is the best place for kids,” she said, “but we also want them to be safe.” All across the nation, school officials are trying to balance safety against learning losses. Initial research showed that during the first round of school closures, American children were set back, on average, by seven months in their reading and math learning, with children from low-income families, and students of color, experiencing even bigger losses. Still, district leaders in Los Angeles and San Diego said, California was not in a position to reopen schools. “Those countries that have managed to safely reopen schools have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available,” the statement said. “California has neither. The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.” Mr. Beutner, whose district is the nation’s second largest, said in an interview that schools “can’t just tap our heels together” like Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz” and “pretend it’s appropriate to bring people back” despite “skyrocketing” rates of new infections.
0~Fact-Checking the Democratic Debate~Ten candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the stage Thursday night in Houston for the third round of debates. Unlike the previous debates, which took place over two evenings, only one night was needed to feature all who qualified for the showdown. Here is how the candidates’ remarks stacked up against the truth. [And here are highlights from the debate.] What the Facts are Julián Castro said Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s health plan would not cover enough of the nation’s uninsured population and would not automatically enroll people who were eligible. WHAT Mr. Castro SAID: “I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered.” Later, he added, “The difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in — they would automatically be enrolled.”
0~In Aftermath of Notre-Dame Fire, Macron Urges Unity in Fragmented Nation~PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron asked French citizens on Tuesday night to come together in the aftermath of the calamitous fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral and to move beyond the divisions that have wrenched the country during months of violent street protests. Mr. Macron, who has faced a virtual uprising against his pro-business government, sought to rally a country still devastated by the fire and turn the profound, yet undoubtedly fleeting, moment of national mourning and unity to his advantage. Like his predecessor, François Hollande, who steered France through two terrorist attacks, Mr. Macron suggested that politics be forgotten in the aftermath of the fire and called attention to the grand national rebuilding project — vowing to restore the gargantuan Gothic gem in a mere five years.
0~Elizabeth Warren Accuses Wells Fargo Chief of ‘Gutless Leadership’~WASHINGTON — The more the chief executive of Wells Fargo tried to explain, the more skeptical the senators became. For more than two hours testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, John G. Stumpf expressed regret that Wells Fargo had created as many as two million bogus bank and credit card accounts without its customers’ consent. He apologized for failing to stop the illicit behavior sooner, and vowed to make amends. Some of the senators on the committee scoffed. Mr. Stumpf, they said, was offering little more than platitudes while allowing his top executives to avoid any real consequences — like being fired or having their enormous pay packages clawed back. Instead, the bank’s lowest-paid workers have borne the brunt of the punishment, the senators noted. Senior management, they said, seemed to ignore this practice because it helped turn the bank into a profit machine.

0~Las amenazas de Trump de acabar con el TLCAN pueden hacerse realidad~Si el acuerdo sucumbe, Estados Unidos, Canadá y México volverían a tarifas arancelarias promedio, las cuales son relativamente bajas: apenas unos puntos porcentuales en la mayoría de los casos. Sin embargo, varios productos agrícolas enfrentarían aranceles mucho más altos. Para enviar sus productos a México, los agricultores estadounidenses tendrían que pagar 25 por ciento de impuestos por la carne de res; 45 por ciento por el pavo y algunos productos lácteos, y 75 por ciento por el pollo, las papas y el jarabe de maíz de alta fructosa. Durante meses, algunos de los líderes empresariales más poderosos de los países involurados —y los cabilderos y políticos que los representan— habían esperado que la retórica del presidente estadounidense fuera más una táctica de negociación que una amenaza verdadera y pensaban que al final aceptaría su agenda de modernización. El TLCAN tiene casi un cuarto de siglo de vida y la gente de todo el espectro político asegura que debería actualizarse para el siglo XXI y preservar el sistema de libre comercio que ha vinculado la economía de Norteamérica. El pacto ha permitido que las industrias reorganicen sus cadenas de suministro en toda la región para aprovechar los recursos y fortalezas distintivas de los tres países, lo cual estimuló las economías del área y generó un incremento de más del triple en el comercio de Estados Unidos con Canadá y México desde sus inicios. Los economistas sostienen que estos cambios han beneficiado a muchos trabajadores ofreciéndoles salarios más altos y más empleos, pero muchos trabajadores quedaron sin empleo cuando las fábricas se reubicaron en México o Canadá, y esto provocó que el TLCAN se volviera el blanco de ataque de sindicatos, muchos demócratas y algunas industrias. No obstante, la mayoría de los líderes empresariales mantenían la esperanza de que Trump, quien ha criticado el TLCAN de forma constante, quedaría satisfecho con supervisar modificaciones para modernizar el acuerdo y después proclamar el resultado como una “transformación política”. Hubo ocasiones en que parecía que así iba a ser. El nombramiento de Robert Lighthizer como representante comercial de Estados Unidos, quien en su audiencia de confirmación prometió que “no dañaría” el TLCAN, reconfortó a muchos en el Capitolio, donde Lighthizer trabajó durante mucho tiempo. Y cuando la administración divulgó sus metas de negociación para el acuerdo en julio, hicieron eco muchas de las prioridades de administraciones pasadas. Con todo, después de ocho semanas de pláticas sobre el acuerdo —las cuales en un inicio iban a concluir a finales de año—, la administración Trump continúa presionando para que se hagan concesiones que en esencia socavarían el pacto, según advierten los círculos empresariales, y que pocos observadores creen que Canadá y México podrían aceptar políticamente. “Todos saben que una gran parte de lo que se está proponiendo en áreas clave es en realidad imposible de lograr, lo cual genera la siguiente pregunta: ¿qué está intentando obtener la administración de Trump exactamente?”, mencionó en un correo electrónico Michael Camunez, quien fue asistente del secretario de Comercio de Estados Unidos durante la presidencia de Obama. No es descabellado pensar que al admitir las posturas más extremas del presidente, los negociadores estadounidenses estén “simplemente dando espacio a Trump para que haga lo que en verdad quiere hacer: retirarse del acuerdo”, afirmó Camunez.
0~Texas Governor Greg Abbott Pauses Reopening~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” [music] michael barbaro Today: Texas has become the latest hotspot in the pandemic, forcing its governor to pause the state’s reopening process after a surge of infections and hospitalizations. My colleague, Manny Fernandez, on the state’s dilemma. It’s Friday, June 26. Manny, what is the story of how Texas has handled the pandemic and how it is we got to this point? manny fernandez So really, there’s a couple of things to know about Texas. And that is that historically, Texas has been mistrustful of government. This is a state where the state legislature meets once every two years. michael barbaro Wow. manny fernandez This is a state where most people who ride a motorcycle don’t have to wear a helmet. And the government doesn’t necessarily force them to wear a helmet. It’s this idea that you’re on your own. You want to wear a helmet, go for it. You don’t, and you get hurt, well, OK. It’s on you. And especially during the Obama years, this was happening. Where Texas sued the government for overreach several times on several different issues. archived recording Joined now by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. You’ve brought suits against the administration some 30 times. Correct? archived recording (greg abbott) This is the 31st lawsuit that I’ve brought against the Obama administration, having won more than half of them. But Martha, this may be the most serious one. Because — manny fernandez And the attorney general at the time had this famous line where the attorney general says, You know what? My job is very simple. I wake up in the morning. I go to the office. I sue the Obama administration. And then I go home. archived recording (greg abbott) If a president can get away with extending his powers to do things like this, there could be no constitutional limitation on what the president could do. That is why — manny fernandez And so all of that sort of changes or looks a little bit different after Trump takes office. Now the Republicans in Texas no longer have that big enemy. And they don’t have somebody to go after in their fight over limiting government overreach. And so they identify a new enemy. [music] manny fernandez And that’s the Democrats who lead the major cities like San Antonio, Austin, Houston. And so this sort of war of words and war of policy begins, where the governor and the Republican leadership of Texas has come into the cities and said, “San Antonio, you know, we want you to cooperate more with the federal authorities on immigration. “Austin, you have a homelessness crisis, and we’re going to get involved. Houston, you have some failing schools, and we want to do a state takeover of the public schools in Houston.” michael barbaro So this is kind of a strange contradiction you’re describing here. Where the Republicans who run the state say they want less government, told the Obama administration they want less government. But now in the era of Trump, they are interfering in the government of their local Democratic cities in a way that may not feel like less government. manny fernandez It’s a complete contradiction. And that is the situation that’s happening as coronavirus hits Texas. And in fact, that attorney general who said how much he loved to sue Obama, well, that attorney general is now the governor, Greg Abbott. And he’s the one who’s responsible for the state’s response to the coronavirus. michael barbaro OK. So given that very complicated stew that you have just described, how does Texas, under this governor, Greg Abbott, respond to the virus? What does his handling of this look like? manny fernandez Overall, you have the governor making some contradictory moves. Starting back in March, you have the coronavirus spreading in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast. California is the first state to issue a stay at home order. New York follows. Ohio. But in a lot of other states, like Texas, there is no similar move. And a lot of these states, some of them in the South, don’t kind of register the same sort of crisis happening in their own states. And then, on March 23, archived recording Gov. Patrick — Lt. Gov. Patrick agreed to join us tonight we’re happy that he did. Lieutenant Governor, thanks so much for coming on. manny fernandez You have Dan Patrick, who’s the lieutenant governor of Texas. He’s Texas’s second in command. archived recording (dan patrick) Yeah, I turn 70 next week. You know, so I’m automatically in the high risk pool. manny fernandez Dan Patrick goes on Fox News and basically says — archived recording (dan patrick) And you know, Tucker, no one reached out to me and said, As a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that’s the exchange, I’m all in. manny fernandez He and other grandparents are willing to die to reopen the economy. And we also have happening is that Abbott around this time, he’s shutting schools. He’s prohibiting visits to nursing homes. He’s doing a lot of little things, but not doing that big important one, which is to issue a statewide stay-at-home order. And so meanwhile, you have the local officials who run a lot of the big cities and counties in Texas saying, OK, we’re going to do this on our own. And we’re going to enact local policies. You have the mayors and the officials who run the counties that have Houston and Austin and San Antonio and El Paso all doing different things to try to control the virus. Some of them are issuing curfews. Some of them are issuing local stay-at-home orders. And Abbott is kind of letting all that happen and not really getting involved. archived recording (greg abbott) I am also modifying my previous executive order about social distancing protocols in Texas. manny fernandez But then he does get involved. archived recording (greg abbott) I’m issuing Executive Order G.A. 14 that establishes, or that maximizes the number of lives we can save. I’m establishing essential services and activities protocols. manny fernandez He does eventually issue a statewide stay-at-home order. But he doesn’t call it that. archived recording (greg abbott) This is not a stay at home strategy. A stay at home strategy would mean that you have to stay at home. You cannot leave home under any circumstances. That obviously is not what we’ve articulated here. This is a standard — manny fernandez And so that leads to a lot of confusion among not just politicians, but just, you know, Texans. Wondering the very basic question, OK, does Texas have a statewide stay-at-home order or not? michael barbaro And does he ever clarify it? manny fernandez He does clarify it. archived recording (greg abbott) This is Gov. Greg Abbott. With Covid-19 spreading across Texas, I issued this executive order that requires all Texans to stay at home, except to provide essential services or do essential things like going to the grocery store. Now I know this is a great — manny fernandez And it’s clear that that was a statewide stay-at-home order. archived recording (greg abbott) And we will make it through this challenge together. Thank you. And God bless you all. manny fernandez And the war between the blue cities and the red state comes up again. Because Abbott, after issuing the statewide stay-at-home order, basically later on tells the cities and the counties, “OK guys, my state orders supersede your local orders.” michael barbaro Hmm. manny fernandez “You can’t do anything that’s tougher than what I’m doing on coronavirus.” michael barbaro Interesting. manny fernandez And it sort of nullifies and sort of ties the hands of the local officials in doing their own local action on coronavirus. michael barbaro So after being very laissez faire and, maybe, classically Texas in a hands-off approach, this Republican governor is now telling these cities and counties who acted in his place that his late actions now supersede their earlier solutions. manny fernandez Yes, exactly. And there’s a lot of confusion. But it has a real effect on people’s lives. michael barbaro How so? manny fernandez Well it has to do with, can you wear a mask when you’re out in public in San Antonio or not? You know, the locals say, yes, I do have to. Abbott says no. Like, what is going on, you know? It has a very real world impact. And — archived recording Shelley Luther is the owner of Salon À La Mode. She arrived here defiantly opening the doors to her salon. manny fernandez Another thing happens where a Dallas salon owner is not supposed to open. She does reopen. archived recording Luther says she fully expects to get arrested today. But she says she has also filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. manny fernandez And she is sent to jail for reopening. michael barbaro Right. I remember this. She was arrested. archived recording (sean hannity) We have a disturbing story out of the great state of Texas tonight. In Texas, a local salon owner, her name is Shelley Luther. manny fernandez And she becomes a conservative celebrity — archived recording (sean hannity) She was given a seven day jail sentence, fined $7,000, all because she opened the doors to her business in spite of quote, “local lockdown orders.” manny fernandez — who was trying to sort of provide for her family by reopening, by restarting the economy. And she’s punished and sent to jail for it. And the governor does something that, again, frustrates the local officials and fuels this war between the blue cities and the red state. archived recording Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has modified his orders to eliminate confinement as punishment, effectively freeing Shelley Luther. manny fernandez Abbott says, Hold on, guys, on my statewide orders, you can’t send someone to jail for a violation. michael barbaro Hm. archived recording (CROWD CHANTING) Shelley free! Shelley free! manny fernandez Because the uproar among conservatives was so loud and so fierce for that Dallas salon owner, he had to backtrack that. michael barbaro So this is becoming a very high stakes Abbott and Costello kind of routine, where the governor is undercutting the cities and the cities are saying this is the rule. And then the state’s saying, no, it’s not. And I’m guessing that the people of Texas are pretty baffled. manny fernandez When Abbott publicly does an about-face and says, “Actually, sorry, guys, you can’t send someone to jail, we can’t be that tough,” that moment helped create this atmosphere of almost a little bit of anything goes then. Where it’s, like, what are the rules for coronavirus in Texas? What are the penalties? What can people do? What can’t they do? michael barbaro And how seriously should it be taken? manny fernandez And does it matter? And who’s going to enforce it? And you know, in that moment, Abbott helped Texans let their guard down. And that only increases as the reopening continues. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. archived recording (greg abbott) My executive order to stay at home, that was issued last month, is set to expire on April the 30th. That executive order has done its job to slow the growth of Covid-19. And I will let it expire as scheduled. michael barbaro Manny, how long does this shutdown in Texas last? manny fernandez Not very long at all. Texas had one of the shortest shutdowns in the country, 28 days. archived recording (greg abbott) Now it’s time to set a new course, a course that responsibly opens up business in Texas. We will open in a way that uses — michael barbaro And how does Gov. Abbott explain having such a short shutdown in the face of a national coronavirus pandemic? manny fernandez His explanation is effectively, the coronavirus is bad around the country, but it’s not that bad in Texas. archived recording (greg abbott) More than 1.9 million claims have been filed. And over $2 billion has been paid out in unemployment benefits. Now our goal, of course, is to get those Texans back to work. manny fernandez And he doesn’t want to hurt the economy more than he needs to. archived recording (greg abbott) We are Texans. We got this. michael barbaro So what exactly does the reopening look like? I mean, how quickly does it go from stay at home to something that actually looks like a pretty open society again? manny fernandez You know almost immediately. The reopening started on May 1. I’m in Houston, and I remember driving around Houston on that day. And I remember being at an intersection. There were two guys standing with these signs with big arrows that said, “Open for dine-in.” It was a little bit of a celebratory feel. And meanwhile, you had some Republican conservatives saying “Restaurants are open, other businesses, great. But what about the gyms and the hair salons? Those are still closed.” So you had some conservatives saying, “Great, governor. Let’s do some more here. What’s wrong?” And then meanwhile, you had Democrats, including many local officials, saying, I don’t like this. We have to do it. We have to go along with it. But we’re in a little bit of a risk zone, heading towards the danger zone. michael barbaro And once this reopening is well underway, Manny, just how quickly do the infections start to rise? manny fernandez It doesn’t happen immediately. You have the numbers going up in May. But they’re going up at sort of a steady, but not alarming, clip. And then, in the last couple of weeks, as more phases of the reopening have taken effect, as more businesses have reopened, those numbers have hit the ceiling. michael barbaro What do you mean? manny fernandez The numbers of new cases skyrocketed. archived recording 1,935 as of Monday. manny fernandez And the numbers of hospitalizations skyrocketed. archived recording Reported yesterday as more than 2,200. North Texas has — manny fernandez There was more testing being done. But that didn’t account for such a high number so quickly — archived recording 2,504 new cases reported — manny fernandez — happening in cities in South Texas near the border — archived recording 41 percent increase over the past two weeks. manny fernandez — in cities in West Texas, in cities in Central Texas, in Austin, outside of Austin — archived recording More than 4,400 new positive cases. manny fernandez — parts of Waco, Houston area, East Texas. You have the numbers — archived recording Coronavirus rose nearly 60 percent. manny fernandez — kind of going up in a lot of different places, a lot of different hot spots. You had nursing home numbers being very high. You also had the numbers of meatpacking plants, those numbers were very high. michael barbaro So it’s clear that this is plain old community transmission, Texans infecting other Texans and not social distancing. manny fernandez A lot of local officials believe that. And a lot of the public health experts believe that. Yes. They are saying that this uptick is tied to more and more Texans letting their guard down, not wearing a mask, going to restaurants, going out, going to the beaches, having more gatherings. That the reopening is directly tied to the increase in the number of new cases, and so you get to the point where we are now, which is Texas sort of daily breaking records of new cases. michael barbaro And when you say records are being broken, what are the specific numbers? manny fernandez Yesterday, Texas had the most new cases it’s had since the pandemic started in a single day. And that was more than 6,200. So there were more than 6,200 new cases in one day, yesterday, in the state of Texas. And one of the biggest alarm bells that rang was one of the most prominent infectious disease experts and vaccine experts in Texas, it’s a doctor named Dr. Hotez out of Baylor Hospital in Houston, he put out a tweet over the weekend. And his tweet said that if the numbers in Houston continued to go up the way they were, that Houston would be the hardest hit city in America as far as the outbreak goes. michael barbaro So that brings us to Thursday, and the governor’s decision to pause this opening? manny fernandez Yes. And so the governor isn’t rolling back the reopening. He’s not shutting the state down. He’s just saying, From hence forward, we’re going to pause any new reopening. Now a lot of people have said, Well, there’s a problem with that. You know, Texas is basically fully open right now. Restaurants right now in Texas are allowed to operate at 75 percent capacity. And 75 percent capacity versus 100 percent, it’s not really going to make that much difference. michael barbaro Right. I mean, given the conditions you’re describing, it feels like we’re basically back to where we were in late March. Where the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, for all the reasons that we touched on earlier, is afraid once again to order a shutdown when it is perhaps the best solution to the conditions on the ground. And back in March, the question around a shutdown was very urgent because it might have prevented a crisis. Now Texas is in a crisis. And a shutdown would be perhaps required to contain it. manny fernandez That’s absolutely it. It’s this inherently contradictory dance where he’s saying, “Folks, Texas is open. But stay indoors. “Texas, you should wear a mask. But I’m not going to order you to wear a mask. Texas is open. We are now in a crisis with our numbers going up. I’m not going to stop that reopening. I’m just going to pause any new reopening we might have done down the road.” michael barbaro From the outside, there is a sense that states like Texas had extra time, at least from the perspective of a place like New York or Seattle. They had time to watch and learn from the experiences of the hardest and earliest hit communities in the country. And that they should have known that this was going to happen. And that what is happening right now in Texas, as a result of closing down late and opening early, was fairly predictable and yet is now a very serious public health crisis. So what would Gov. Abbott say, do you think, to the least charitable version of this question, which is, is there really any excuse for Texas being in this situation right now? manny fernandez I don’t know what Gov. Abbott would say. But I know that it comes down to world view and the Texas ideology. Because it comes down to, you’re absolutely right, Texas just needing to look around at other states, and see what was happening, and see the writing on the wall. But Texas didn’t want to do that. Texas wants to follow its own path, even in a pandemic. [music] michael barbaro Manny, thank you very much. And stay safe. manny fernandez Thank you so much. And thanks for having me on. michael barbaro On Thursday, based on the results of antibody tests, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the number of infections in the U.S. is probably 10 times higher than has been reported. That would mean that so far about 23 million Americans, or 7 percent of the population, have been infected. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. On Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled that immigrants seeking asylum do not have the right to make their case in federal courts, siding with the Trump administration as it seeks to speed up deportations. The 7 to 2 ruling upheld a 1996 law passed by Congress that limited the role of federal courts in reviewing rejected claims of asylum. Such a review process, the justices ruled, would overwhelm the nation’s immigration system. And amid growing calls for police reforms, officials in three states, Arizona, Colorado, and New York, are confronting cases of alleged brutality by their police officers. archived recording To demonstrate my willingness to take accountability for these mistakes, I am offering my resignation to the mayor, city council, and city manager, which they can accept or handle as they deem appropriate. michael barbaro
0~While We Weren’t Looking, Snapchat Revolutionized Social Networks~Snap Inc., the parent company of the popular photo-messaging and storytelling app Snapchat, is having a productive autumn. A couple of weeks ago, Snap filed confidential documents for a coming stock offering that could value the firm at $30 billion, which would make it one of the largest initial public offerings in recent years. Around the same time, it began selling Spectacles, sunglasses that can record video clips, which have become one of the most sought-after gadgets of the season. And yet, even when it’s grabbing headlines, it often seems as if Snap gets little respect. Though Snapchat has overtaken Twitter in terms of daily users to become one of the most popular social networks in the world, it has not attracted the media attention that the 140-character platform earns, perhaps because journalists and presidential candidates don’t use it very much. Snapchat’s news division has become a popular and innovative source of information for young people, but it is rarely mentioned in the hand-wringing over how social media affected the presidential election. And because Snapchat is used primarily by teenagers and 20-somethings, and it seems deliberately designed to frustrate anyone over 25, it is often dismissed as a frivolity by older people (especially readers of a certain newspaper based in New York who have my email address).
0~Heitkamp Apologizes for Embarrassing Error in Campaign Ad~Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota issued an apology on Tuesday for an ad her campaign ran that incorrectly identified victims of sexual abuse, throwing her uphill re-election bid further off balance just three weeks before the midterms. Ms. Heitkamp, one of the Democrats’ most endangered incumbents, ran a newspaper ad criticizing comments her Republican opponent, Representative Kevin Cramer, made about victims of sexual misconduct. The ad, which was made to look like an open letter to Mr. Cramer, included the names of more than 120 women. After the ad ran, however, several women took to social media to say they had not given permission for Ms. Heitkamp’s campaign to use their names. “We recently discovered that several of the women’s names who were provided to us did not authorize their names to be shared or were not survivors of abuse,” Ms. Heitkamp said in a statement on Tuesday.
0~Gina Prince-Bythewood Made a Summer Blockbuster. It’s About Time.~“Hey, this is Gina Prince-Bythewood director of The Old Guard. So at this point in the film, Nile has been revealed as a new immortal, and Andy is coming to get her to pull her into the fold, and Nile is not happy about it. Nile played by KiKi Layne and Andy played by Charlize Theron. So for me, the best action scenes are ones that have a story to it, that have a beginning, middle, and end but are also character driven and further the story. And the story of this was really Nile is freaked out about what’s happening to her. She’s been kidnapped by this woman that she doesn’t know or understand and who shot her in the head, and she wants to be free. Andy has this new immortal, wants to test her, see what she’s about, see how good she is.” “I can fly a plane. You don’t speak Russian, do you?” “Why?” “Because I told the pilot to play dead.” “So these two come together in a fight, and one of the best templates that we used was the bathroom fight in Mission Impossible— Fallout. And what was so good about it is that you saw the actors. You saw the emotion. You saw the story to it. And that’s what I wanted for this and why it was so important for both Charlize and KiKi to train hard enough so we could really see them. It could really be them in the fight as opposed to stunt doubles. What we talked about a lot with my incredible stunt team was that I wanted to see the difference in how these two women fought. For Nile, she’s a Marine, so she started out fighting the way she was taught in the Marines with the martial-arts program. But as the fight continues and she starts to get more and more frustrated because she cannot even touch Andy, she just kind of lets that all go and just starts throwing bows, basically. And Andy, again, the whole time is playing with her and toying with her. I knew I wanted to stay in a confined space, so the DP, Tami Reiker, and I, decided not to give ourselves that crutch of having walls that could move. We wanted to be confined as well. So we built an actual plane with no flying walls. It was I think maybe six feet tall, so it was tough. But also we knew we wanted to shoot just all natural light, so there was no lighting so we could always shoot 360 at any point. And the rehearsal process was first they learned the choreography separately, did the training, learned how to throw a punch. For women, the tell of whether they are athletic or not is a punch. If you can throw a punch, we’re going to believe that you’re a fighter. And building on that, seeing what the actors were best at and what they would look good doing.” “You’re very good.”
0~Ukraine Envoy Testifies Trump Linked Military Aid to Investigations~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: The Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry are calling Tuesday’s testimony the most damning yet, implicating President Trump himself in a quid pro quo over military aid to Ukraine. It’s Wednesday, October 23. [phone ringing] speaker This is Edward. How can I help you? michael barbaro Hi, there. I’m trying to reach Nick Fandos from The New York Times? speaker Oh, yeah. I just saw him go into Booth 1. Hold on a second. Let me transfer you over. nicholas fandos Hey, this is Nick. michael barbaro Hey, it’s Michael. nicholas fandos Hi, Michael. How are you? michael barbaro I’m great. How are you? nicholas fandos Long time, no talk. michael barbaro Yeah. It’s been a full 72 hours. nicholas fandos [LAUGHS] [music] michael barbaro Nick Fandos covers Congress for The Times. Nick, where did we leave off with you last week? nicholas fandos So remember, last week we heard testimony from a string of American diplomats, both career diplomats and political appointees working for Donald Trump. And what they describe day after day in testimony was, essentially, the traditional American foreign policy apparatus getting sidelined or pushed aside by President Trump, his personal lawyer, and a cadre of political appointees who were close around him and were setting the agenda for the country’s policy toward Ukraine. michael barbaro Right. And the names that kept coming up again and again were Rudy Giuliani and Gordon Sondland? nicholas fandos That’s right. And by Thursday, we heard from Sondland himself, who you’ll remember is the ambassador to the European Union. He’s a former Trump political donor. Sondland, after witness after witness this week had placed him at the center of this shadow foreign policy, if you will, came in and essentially said, hey, I know there’s all this attention on me, but I was merely following the directions of President Trump. michael barbaro And Nick, what did we hear in this testimony about what the point of this shadow structure was? Why have it? What are they up to? nicholas fandos So a lot of this testimony revolved around a meeting that the Ukrainians wanted to have with President Trump at the White House that they believed would lend credibility to the new administration in that country. And the questions that came up again and again were, was there a quid pro quo that the Trump administration was trying to extract investigations from the Ukrainians into the president’s political rivals in exchange for that meeting? That they were holding out that meeting and saying, we’ll only give you this if we get what we want. But what’s interesting is what they weren’t testifying about. For the most part, there was very little discussion last week of the military aid that President Trump had ordered to be frozen this summer. This is almost $400 million in security funds that Congress allocated in a bipartisan fashion for Ukraine. And there have been allegations, first from the whistle-blower that initiated this case and throughout, that that aid may have been frozen as a leverage point as well, as another kind of quid pro quo to extract these politically advantageous investigations. But we weren’t hearing a whole lot about that as the week wore on. michael barbaro Right. There were two allegations of a quid pro quo. There was the White House visit in exchange for these investigations, and then there was this $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. And my sense is that the allegation that the military aid had been held up in this scheme was by far the more explosive of the two. nicholas fandos That’s right. Remember, when House Democrats launched this impeachment inquiry a little bit more than a month ago, it was the prospect of $400 million in bipartisan approved military aid that had most alarmed lawmakers in both parties. It’s that military aid that got moderate Democrats, the ones from swing districts that President Trump won in 2016 who are kind of teetering on the edge as they face re-election, to come on board and say, yes, we do support an inquiry. They threw crucial support behind this investigation explicitly because it was tied to national security. michael barbaro Right. And what did you make of the fact that the money, which had been the source of so much focus, wasn’t really coming up? Did that at all cause you to wonder, as I will admit it did for me, if the military aid aspect of the story maybe just wasn’t there? If it hadn’t maybe been something that the president was holding over Ukraine to get these investigations he wanted into the Democrats? nicholas fandos I think that that certainly began to feel like more of a possibility. The Trump administration has given publicly other reasons for withholding this aid. And in some respects, it makes sense that they would have withheld it when they were looking to cut down on the expensive foreign aid all over the country. So — michael barbaro Right. nicholas fandos — I wouldn’t have been altogether surprised if that part of the story continued to shrink away. At the same time, so much of what the original whistle-blower — who has brought this case to the fore, who helped launch this impeachment inquiry indirectly — has alleged has borne out to date, that I don’t think we could fully rule out the idea that the aid had been held up as leverage for these investigations. And so it just remained a kind of open, tantalizing question, will this bear out or won’t it? And that’s where we pick things up this week. michael barbaro O.K., so get us up to speed about what actually happened on Tuesday. nicholas fandos So on Tuesday morning, William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine right now, arrived on Capitol Hill for his own deposition with House impeachment investigators. michael barbaro And what we need to know about Bill Taylor besides that? nicholas fandos So Taylor is another one of these career national security officials who has served Democrats and Republicans. He’s been serving the country, he told investigators today, for 50 years, starting as a cadet at West Point, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, Jerusalem. During George W. Bush’s administration, he was an ambassador to Ukraine. And he had actually retired when the State Department contacted him early this year, after Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, was ousted by President Trump, and asked him if he’d be willing to come back to take control of the American mission in Ukraine and help to implement the president’s policies. And he began explaining to investigators today that he knew, in a sense, what he was getting into, and he had real pause as he looked toward taking this job. He sought assurances from the State Department, essentially, that he would be able to exercise policy as he saw fit and that he wasn’t going to be a victim of the same kind of political games that she was. With those assurances, he ultimately decided in May that he would sign up. And he flew over to Kiev and began his role as ambassador. What came next, he made pretty clear, is something like his worst nightmare. [music] nicholas fandos And on Tuesday, he outlined that nightmare in a 15-page opening statement, which he read methodically over 40 minutes — michael barbaro Wow. nicholas fandos — to investigators gathered behind closed doors. michael barbaro And what does he say in this opening statement? nicholas fandos So Taylor begins a lot — like a lot of witnesses last week began. He describes two channels of foreign policy, an official channel and the kind of shadow or irregular channel, toward Ukraine. And he says basically, at first, these things are aligned. He told investigators, when I first arrived in Kiev in June and July, the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal — a strong U.S.-Ukrainian partnership. But what he documents in copious notes and calls that he reconstructs and experiences that he has with other diplomats involved is a divergence of those two channels, a disintegration of the first one, essentially, in favor of the second. And he says, it became clear to me by August that the channels had diverged in their objectives. michael barbaro And what happened that led him to feel by August that there were two different sets of priorities here, that these things were no longer in line? nicholas fandos So it’s not long after Taylor arrives in Ukraine that it becomes increasingly clear to him that something funny is going on. At first, he hears from Ambassador Sondland that what the president really wants from the new Ukrainian leadership is a commitment to investigate his political opponents, the Bidens, and a conspiracy theory about Democratic and Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election, and that to secure a visit to the White House, a visit that the Ukrainians badly want, will be contingent upon them publicly committing to conducting those investigations. As the summer goes on, he learns in July that, inexplicably and despite the guidance of the Defense Department and the State Department, the president has ordered the Office of Management and Budget to freeze the $400 million in security aid that is meant to be delivered to the Ukrainians. Taylor is completely alarmed by this. Remember, Taylor really knows the threat to Ukraine well, and he understands the power that this money has to help prop up its military. But what he doesn’t understand is why, at first, the money is being held up. And he describes, shortly after hearing that it’s going to be withheld, traveling to the northern border of Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces are coming into contact with mounting hostile Russian-led forces, and thinking to himself, “I know this aid is being withheld, and these guys don’t.” And this is the face of the threat. More Ukrainians are going to die if the United States assistance does not come through. michael barbaro Wow. nicholas fandos And so he is really shaken by this and describes a series of meetings where he and others are trying to push to get it reinstated. And it’s around this time, Taylor testifies, he got on the phone with Sondland. And Sondland essentially said to him that everything, the White House meeting and the aid, were contingent upon the Ukrainians committing to these investigations. He said Sondland drew an analogy. He said, think of the president like a businessman. And when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, the businessman asks that that person pay up before signing the check.” Now, Taylor is completely taken aback by this. In his view, the analogy doesn’t make any sense. Why would the Ukrainians owe President Trump anything? michael barbaro Right. nicholas fandos The security systems had been allocated. And its delivery made sense not just for the Ukrainians, but for the United States’s strategic interest. So this is a kind of key seam that, to him, exposes that to President Trump and those who are enabling him in this effort, it’s not about America’s national security. It’s just about these investigations. And that is what the president is after. That’s the sole goal of his foreign policy here, of this second channel that broke off from the first and seems to be, at this point, more or less the one that matters to the White House. [music] michael barbaro We’ll be right back. So Nick, how do you find out about all this testimony on Tuesday? nicholas fandos So Tuesday was another long day outside of the House Intelligence Committee SCIF. But it was a little unusual in that not long after the testimony began, Democrats began to come out — archived recording (eric swalwell) I’m not going to comment on what he said inside there. nicholas fandos — and, without giving specifics, essentially say on the record — archived recording (andy levin) In my 10 short months in Congress, this is the — my most disturbing day in Congress so far. nicholas fandos This is a pretty remarkable thing we’ve just heard. archived recording (ted lieu) And his opening statement is devastating to Donald Trump. nicholas fandos This may be the most significant testimony yet. archived recording (ted lieu) It was very damning for the president. nicholas fandos And they all walk out with copies of his 15-page opening statement in their hands, but none of them will give it up to the press. So you know, I basically spent hours running around, working the phones, trying to get my hands on this piece of paper. And only by the early afternoon was I able to get a copy and start reading it and making sense of it. michael barbaro And Nick, is a lot of what these Democrats are so excited about, outside this secure room where you’re waiting on Tuesday, is that now the money, the military aid, is back in the picture? It’s now showing up in these hearings after a week where it had not been present. nicholas fandos I think that’s right. I mean, what they got with Bill Taylor today was somebody who had been there, had had a front seat to this whole story, come in and say, yeah, this thing in the middle, the military aid, the kind of — the worst possible thing in all of these allegations, that happened. That was true, and here’s why that matters. Democrats will tell you that any quid pro quo in this case is inappropriate. Even withholding a White House meeting is inappropriate and potentially impeachable from their point of view. But it’s the security aid, the withholding of a significant chunk of money that Republicans and Democrats both support, that they think is an obvious step for the United States to take for its own interests and to help its allies in Europe. That that would be withheld is, in political terms, kind of another magnitude of significance. And it’s the thing that Democrats think Republicans and, frankly, voters around the country are more likely to be convinced by. That hundreds of millions of dollars in hard military aid to fight a conflict against the Russians just resonates more with people. That’s a bigger kind of thing to be messing around with than a meeting at the White House, which most people don’t know why a meeting gets scheduled or doesn’t get scheduled. So by reinserting the military aid into the center of this, it reopens the possibility that this case could become more than a partisan exercise. michael barbaro But Nick, as you said, the whole impeachment inquiry began with a phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president, in which military aid appeared to be withheld in exchange for these investigations that Trump wants. What’s different about what happened on Tuesday that makes it such a big deal? nicholas fandos So what we had before was an anonymous allegation from a whistle-blower whose information didn’t seem to be firsthand. And in any case, the public doesn’t know who that whistle-blower is. They can’t evaluate that person’s claims. What we had on Tuesday was the top American diplomat in Ukraine, the guy who was supposed to be managing the relationship between the two countries, coming forward and testifying on the record, before Congress, that he saw a quid pro quo, that he saw the aid being withheld to extract political gain for the president of the United States. And he offered an authoritative, detailed and vivid account of how that went down. And that goes a long way. It’s not the whole case, but it goes a long way in establishing for Democrats and for this investigation that what they suspected, what was initially alleged, did, in fact, occur. michael barbaro So at this point, what was first an anonymous allegation delivered by a whistle-blower was just very much confirmed by an ambassador under oath, like you just said. So what more evidence do people on the impeachment inquiry committees need, do you think, to vote to impeach the president? nicholas fandos So I think what they want is to continue moving towards these kind of inner concentric circles. So if they’ve talked to the ambassador now, next they want to hear from the White House budget office to hear what order exactly came down from President Trump to suspend the aid. What did that sound like? What did people in the office think? What debate happened there? They want to know what was happening in the National Security Council, where advisers and aides to the president were listening to a lot of these calls and interactions in real time, not to mention talking with him, and will have their own accounts as to what was going down. So basically, if Taylor has sketched in this important part of the picture, they’re looking for additional witnesses that are kind of even closer to the action to fill in kind of flourishes and details that will either back up or disprove what he had to say. Because ultimately, what this is really about is about President Trump. You’re not impeaching these other officials around him. The House would vote to impeach President Trump. And they need to be able to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt in the Senate. And so what they’re really after is as precise and vivid a picture as possible of what President Trump was doing and saying and meaning as he took these actions. michael barbaro Right. They want the closest thing possible to direct, irrefutable evidence that the president himself said, withhold this money until I get my investigation. And it sounds like on Tuesday, they got a lot closer to that, but perhaps not all the way. nicholas fandos That’s right, and that’s why the investigation will keep grinding on. [music] michael barbaro Nick, thank you very much. nicholas fandos Glad to be with you again. Happy to do it. [phone hanging up] michael barbaro We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. archived recording (recep tayyip erdogan) [SPEAKING TURKISH] michael barbaro On Tuesday, Turkey and Russia announced that both countries would take joint control over northeast Syria, a major victory for Russia that expands its influence at the expense of the U.S. and Kurdish forces.

0~Suspect in Cleveland Kidnapping Had Some Contact With Police~Those years of captivity ended late Monday when Amanda Berry, who had not been seen since she left her job at a local Burger King on April, 21, 2003, when she was 17, appeared at the front door of the house accompanied by a young child and screamed: “I need help! I need help! I have been kidnapped for 10 years!” After two neighbors freed her by kicking in the chained front door and helped her make an urgent call to 911, three men were arrested in connection with the case — Ariel Castro, 52, the owner of the house, and his brothers, Pedro, 54, and Onil, 50. Ms. Berry and the child, along with Gina DeJesus, who disappeared while walking home from a city middle school in 2004, and Michelle Knight, who vanished at age 20 in 2002, were treated at a hospital and reunited with their families. The conditions in the home, a law enforcement official said, were “abysmal at best.” “They had no ability to leave the home or interact with anyone other than each other, the child and the suspect,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation. Another official said the F.B.I. had begun questioning the women late Tuesday and had taken photos and helped collect evidence from the house. The case recalled other kidnappings, like that of Jaycee Dugard, who was held prisoner in California for 18 years; Elizabeth Smart, who spent nine months in torment after being grabbed from her bedroom in Salt Lake City by Brian David Mitchell; and six women who were snatched, held and tortured in Belgium in the mid-1990s.
0~Britain’s Conservatives Erupt Into Civil War as Unlikely Rebels Defy Boris Johnson~LONDON — They have been called the Conservative rebels, a group of renegade lawmakers willing to risk their careers to defy their newly chosen leader, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and hobble his leadership over their clashing views on Brexit. But behind all the talk of revolutionary ardor and mutinous tactics was an unlikely cadre of insurrectionists — a band of starchy grandees of Tory politics that includes Winston Churchill’s grandson and a 45-year party veteran and ex-chancellor so colorless that he earned the nickname “Spreadsheet Phil.” Running the government only weeks ago, they flouted it on Tuesday from the sidelines. They believe that Mr. Johnson, in his zeal for pulling Britain out of the European Union without a deal, is risking severe damage to the British economy. But they also believe he is tarnishing the Conservatives, setting fire to their vision of a big-tent party with priorities beyond Brexit. In setting aside their usual caution and ripping the heart out of Mr. Johnson’s Brexit plans, they offered perhaps the clearest indication yet that the party, squabbling for decades over Europe, is now enmeshed in a civil war. Mr. Johnson’s team almost immediately kicked the rebels — 21 lawmakers, most of them ex-government ministers — out of the party and barred them from running as Conservatives in the next election.
0~New Zealand announces a plan to move away from lockdowns.~New Zealand, which for most of the pandemic has pursued a “Covid zero” strategy, announced on Friday a new plan to manage life with the virus and move away from lockdowns, beginning once the country meets an ambitious vaccination target. A new, color-coded system of restrictions will take effect once 90 percent of people ages 12 and up have received two doses of a vaccine, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced at a news conference. With Auckland, the country’s largest city, under a lockdown that has stretched to nine weeks because of an outbreak of the Delta variant that has proven frustratingly difficult to stamp out, officials in New Zealand have acknowledged that eliminating the virus completely may no longer be possible. “Delta has made it very hard to maintain our elimination strategy,” Ms. Ardern said, “but as our longstanding strategy was challenged, we also had a new tool. That tool is the vaccine.”
0~Iraqi Militants Stage Political Rally, Then Bombs Go Off~The group was welcomed into Iraq’s political system a few years ago by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, just as American troops were leaving, and his acceptance of it was regarded as a move that further empowered Iran at the expense of the United States. Iran has provided the money and training for the group’s Syria recruitment effort, analysts say. In the Shiite-dominated provinces of southern Iraq, posters urge men to go and fight, and there is a phone number to call. The rallying cry for Iraqi Shiites is the defense of the shrine of Sayeda Zeinab, the Shiite holy site in a Damascus suburb. But they often fight alongside the Syrian government, as well as alongside fighters from Iran and Hezbollah, a Shiite militant movement based in Lebanon, against the rebel fighters, who are largely Sunni Muslims. The group is not only fighting in Syria. It is also back on the streets in Baghdad and in other areas of the country, including Anbar Province, where large sections of territory are in the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Sometimes Asaib Ahl al-Haq’s members fight alongside government forces, and at other times they carry out their own operations, militiamen say. The group was widely blamed for atrocities against Sunnis during the sectarian war of 2005 to 2007; that it is now working hand in hand with the government on the battlefield and vying for votes in the elections is further evidence of Iraq’s rising sectarian tensions. The group’s remobilization has alarmed Iraq’s Sunnis, who recall its role in sectarian fighting just a few years ago. It also highlights the weaknesses of Iraq’s security forces and has raised alarms that the country is backsliding to the days when it was a patchwork of militias and armed groups controlled the streets. Salam al-Jazari, an Asaib Ahl al-Haq parliamentary candidate from Baghdad, said: “All Iraqis are calling for security, and we have experiences in this field. We have military experience. Abroad, we have fighters protecting Zeinab, and inside Iraq we have fighters supporting the security forces. We have many operations inside Baghdad capturing terrorists and car bombs, and we even have our men in all the provinces, as our military wing, to impose security.” In this environment, the group, as it campaigns for seats in Parliament, is not only celebrating its role in the war in Syria but also putting itself forward as the protector of Iraq’s Shiites.
0~How Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton Compare on the Issues~Criminal Justice Mr. Kaine personally opposes the death penalty, but he oversaw 11 executions during his tenure as governor, and Virginia has had the second-highest number of executions since the 1970s. He said his obligation to uphold the law as governor overrode his moral opposition to capital punishment, which was shaped by his Roman Catholic faith. In the Senate, Mr. Kaine has advocated overhauling the criminal justice system and supported a measure that would give judges more flexibility on sentencing. Where Mrs. Clinton stands: Mrs. Clinton supports the death penalty “for very limited purposes” as punishment for heinous crimes such as mass killings and domestic terrorism. She thinks that death penalty cases should be overseen by the federal justice system. She has also said, however, that she would not be disappointed if the Supreme Court or states moved to eliminate capital punishment. She also backs legislation to end racial profiling by law enforcement and reduce prison sentences for nonviolent drug criminals. Guns Mr. Kaine, a gun owner himself, is a consistent supporter of gun control measures and has backed broad background checks and restrictions on the sale of combat-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. The 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech inspired Mr. Kaine, then the governor, to close loopholes in Virginia law that allowed some people to buy guns despite failing background checks. In the Senate, he supported the Manchin-Toomey bill, which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and weapons sold over the internet. He also backed banning gun sales to terrorism suspects on the government’s “no-fly” list. Where Mrs. Clinton stands: She made gun control a key issue in her primary campaign. She wants to expand background checks and supports legislation to keep guns away from suspects of domestic abuse, violent criminals and those with severe mental illness. Foreign Policy Mr. Kaine, who sits on the Senate’s Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, backed the Iran nuclear deal and the normalization of relations with Cuba. He has argued that Mr. Obama must seek authorization from Congress to carry out airstrikes against the Islamic State. And he has called for the establishment of safe zones in Syria to protect civilians.
0~Breaking Nicotine’s Powerful Draw~In interviews, smokers who had heard about the F.D.A.’s announcement said they were conflicted by the prospect of being forced to abandon their addiction, despite knowing full well that it damaged their health and would likely shorten their life span. Mike Harrigan, an options trader who was taking a smoking break outside the Chicago Board of Trade, said he feared he might actually end up smoking more if cigarettes contained significantly lower amounts of nicotine. “It may help newer smokers, but it will hurt people who are used to a certain level of nicotine,” said Mr. Harrigan, 55, who has been a pack-a-day smoker for three decades. Dr. Kozlowski said he was especially concerned by the agency’s mixed messaging and seemingly conflicted stance on e-cigarettes, which deliver nicotine without the tar and many other toxins that are inhaled when tobacco is ignited. Even if the long-term impacts of vaping remain unknown — though health experts agree that teenagers should be discouraged from trying e-cigarettes — there is mounting consensus that such products are useful for helping adult smokers quit. The F.D.A. has so far approved nearly two dozen vaping products and has denied more than a million others, including those made by Juul Labs. Earlier this summer, the agency ordered Juul off shelves, citing the potential harm from chemicals that could leach out of its e-liquid cartridges. But the F.D.A. has since granted the company further review. Dr. Judith Prochaska, an addiction specialist at Stanford University who runs a smoking cessation clinic for patients with cancer and their families, said lighting up during a stressful phone call, while sipping a cocktail or following a meal creates a powerful memory that conditions the mind into associating a cigarette with the stimulation or succor that it delivers via the rush of nicotine. “All these everyday behaviors cue your brain that nicotine is coming,” she said. “It’s basically the Pavlovian dog effect but conditioned here with a highly addictive drug.”
0~Looming Leadership Void at I.R.S. Raises Concerns Over $80 Billion Overhaul~WASHINGTON — A group of former Internal Revenue Service commissioners is raising concerns over the fact that the White House has yet to nominate a replacement for Charles P. Rettig, whose term as I.R.S. commissioner is scheduled to expire next month, warning that the looming vacancy could stall the Biden administration’s planned $80 billion overhaul of the agency. The additional funds are expected to help the beleaguered I.R.S. crack down on tax cheats, improve customer service and update antiquated technology. The funds, which were included in a bill that Democrats passed, are a central part of the Biden administration’s plans to raise more than $120 billion in additional tax revenue over the next decade. Overseeing that transition will be a significant undertaking, and several former I.R.S. leaders are warning that the lack of a new leader could hamper the transformation of the agency. The term of Mr. Rettig, who was appointed by President Donald J. Trump, will end on Nov. 12. The former commissioners, who served under Democratic and Republican presidents, are Fred Goldberg, Charles Rossotti, Mark Everson and John Koskinen. They were joined in their statement by Nina Olson, a former national taxpayer advocate.
0~Amazon Sticks With Office Expansion Plans in New York and Elsewhere~SEATTLE — The pandemic has upended many companies’ expansion plans. Not Amazon’s. The tech giant said on Tuesday that it would hire 3,500 white-collar employees across the country, including 2,000 in New York, following through on plans it had largely put in place before the coronavirus made office towers empty as employees work from home. The new Amazon jobs will fill a lot of office space that the company acquired before Covid-19 took hold in the United States. In early March, Amazon bought the iconic Lord & Taylor building on Fifth Avenue from the co-working company WeWork, which was retrenching after unsustainable expansion. The New York Post reported at the time that Amazon had paid $1.15 billion for the property. Amazon declined to comment on the deal. Amazon expects employees to occupy the space in 2023. The company also plans to expand offices in its hubs in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Phoenix and San Diego within two years. It signed a lease for roughly 90,000 square feet near Phoenix in the first quarter, according to Lee & Associates, a commercial real estate broker. Amazon has 35,000 white-collar employees in more than a dozen tech hubs, so the growth announced on Tuesday would be a 10 percent expansion.
0~Children called for help from inside classrooms in Uvalde. The police waited.~Jasmine Carrillo, 29, was working in the cafeteria with about 40 second-graders and two teachers when the attack began. The lights dimmed — part of a schoolwide lockdown that had gone into effect. Once he entered the fourth-grade building, Ms. Carrillo said, the shooter banged and kicked on the door of her 10-year-old son Mario’s classroom, demanding to be let in. But he could not open the locked door. Instead, he moved to others. In the connected classrooms, Room 111 and Room 112, a pair of teachers, Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia, had also been showing a movie, “Lilo & Stitch,” as the students finished up their lessons. One of the teachers moved to close the door and seal the classroom from the hallway. But the gunman was already there. Miah Cerrillo, 11, watched as her teacher backed into the classroom, and the gunman followed. He shot one teacher first, and then the other. She said he shot many students in her classroom, and then went to the adjoining one and opened fire, said her grandfather, Jose Veloz, 71, relaying the girl’s account. Then he began shooting wildly. The terrifying echo of at least 100 gunshots rattled through the school as children in the classrooms and both of the teachers there were shot and fell to the ground. It was 11:33 a.m. Not all of the children inside were killed in that horrifying moment. Several survived and huddled in fear next to their limp friends. One of the children fell on Miah’s chest as she lay on the ground, her grandfather said. Terrified he would return to her classroom, Miah said, she took the blood of a classmate who fell dead and rubbed it all over herself. Then she played dead herself. Two minutes after the gunman first entered the pair of classrooms, several police officers from the Uvalde Police Department rushed into the school. A pair of officers approached the locked door to the classrooms as gunfire could be heard inside. The two were struck — graze wounds, as their injuries would later be described — as bullets pierced the door and hit them in the hallway.
0~Reform Unlikely to Prevent a New Financial Crisis~The solution should be obvious, shouldn’t it? Just get rid of that special government status  and stop writing regulations that revolve around ratings. Believe it or not, S.& P. is in favor of such a solution. So why isn’t it in the bill? Because all those money market and pension funds much prefer the crutch provided by the ratings  that way, if anything goes wrong they can simply say “It was the rating agency’s fault.” And they’re the ones Congress listened to. Image Elizabeth Warren, chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel, first suggested the consumer protection agency. Credit... Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY The good news is that it hasn’t been completely gutted, despite the efforts of the Chamber of Commerce. The bad news is that it is a lot weaker than it ought to be. The “plain vanilla” option  showing consumers, for example, a 30-year-fixed mortgage alongside an option adjustable-rate mortgage  was tossed overboard long ago. A committee of bank regulators can veto any decision by the consumer agency. An astounding 98 percent of the nation’s banks  every bank with assets under $10 billion  are exempt. And get this: the bill gives the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency the right to pre-empt state laws aimed at stopping predatory practices. This is the same regulator that used its pre-emption powers to moot laws passed by cities and states aimed at curbing the worst subprime excesses during the bubble. Not exactly confidence-inspiring. “The consumer agency has some dings in it right now,” said Elizabeth Warren, the chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel, who first broached the idea for the agency in an article she wrote as a law professor. “I think it still has what it needs to succeed, but it’s right at the edge,” she added. “If it is weakened any further, then it becomes a waste of time.” DERIVATIVE REGULATION You’ve no doubt heard that the vast majority of derivatives will wind up on an exchange, where everyone can see their price and the risks can be toted up out in the open. Don’t get too excited. Most such derivatives will be products like interest rate swaps, which had no role in the crisis. Credit-default swaps, which played a major role in the crisis, are another story. In particular, the most complicated, one-of-a-kind  and most profitable  credit-default swaps will most likely stay in the shadows, which is exactly where the big banks want them to be. The profits the big banks make on these credit derivatives would drop substantially if these swaps were traded openly and, well, we can’t have that, can we? The banks actually argue that credit will be constrained if they are forced to put these swaps on an exchange. It’s like saying, if I can’t gouge you, I won’t lend to you. Nice little business model they’ve got there. The bills try to come at these complex derivatives in other ways, primarily by clamping down on credit speculation and proprietary trading by banks. (That’s what the Volcker Rule is all about.) But I’m skeptical that the Volcker Rule will be effective, even if it becomes law, which appears likely. The line between what constitutes trading for one’s own account  proprietary trading  and what constitutes trading for one’s client, which would still be legal, is extremely murky. It is easy to imagine the banks classifying all sorts of activities as “servicing clients,” even if they happen to put lots of money in their own pockets.
0~Harriet Tubman $20 Bill Is Delayed Until Trump Leaves Office, Mnuchin Says~During the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin said that he was now focused on enhancing the anti-counterfeiting security features of the currency, focusing first on the $10 and $50 bills. Designing new imagery is on the back burner. “It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary down the road.” Replacing Jackson with Tubman was both filled with symbolism and marred by controversy. Tubman was born into slavery, escaped and then returned to the South, where she led other slaves to freedom. She was a Union scout during the Civil War and later advocated women’s voting rights. Jackson orchestrated the removal of Native Americans from lands to the east of the Mississippi River and sent them marching west on the so-called Trail of Tears. In 2017, speculation began that Mr. Trump might scrap Mr. Lew’s plan for the $20 bill when mentions of it were scrubbed from the Treasury Department’s website during a redesign. Then, that August, Mr. Mnuchin made clear that Tubman’s future on the bill was in doubt. “People have been on the bills for a long period of time,” he told CNBC. “This is something we’ll consider. Right now, we’ve got a lot more important issues to focus on.” Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, recently introduced the Harriet Tubman Tribute Act and called on the Treasury Department to offer clarity on the status of the $20 bill. The legislation, if passed, would direct the department to place the likeness of Tubman on $20 Federal Reserve notes printed after Dec. 31, 2020. “There is no excuse for the administration’s failure to make this redesign a priority,” Ms. Shaheen said. “Sadly, this delay sends an unmistakable message to women and girls, and communities of color, who were promised they’d see Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.”
0~Sadr City Fighters Lay Defenses Amid Latest Official Efforts at Calm~BAGHDAD  As the cleric Moktada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army fighters squatted in the Sadr City district’s main highways on Friday, planting homemade bombs less than a mile from Iraqi and American troops, his political bloc offered on Friday to negotiate with the Iraqi government to end fighting in the area. Posing as municipal workers in fluorescent orange and yellow vests, three militia members  one masked with a checkered head scarf  dug holes in one main thoroughfare while wary drivers skirted around them and loose wires trailed across the street every few yards. Nearby, some of the heaviest fighting in weeks broke out late Friday night. The mixed messages, at once conciliatory and threatening, are a hallmark of the Sadr movement, which appears to be gearing up to confront the government both with bullets and at the ballot box in provincial elections this fall. As thousands of Shiites gathered for Friday Prayer, United States and Iraqi troops continued to ring Sadr City, the east Baghdad neighborhood that is Mr. Sadr’s Baghdad redoubt.
0~Kremlin Moves Toward Control of Internet, Raising Censorship Fears~MOSCOW — Russia took a step toward government control over the internet on Thursday, as lawmakers approved a bill that freedom of information advocates worry will open the door to sweeping censorship. The legislation is designed to route web traffic through filters controlled by Roskomnadzor, the state communications watchdog, increasing its power to control information and block messaging or other applications. It also provides for Russia to create its own system of domain names that would allow the internet to continue operating within the country, even if it were cut off from the global web. The bill’s goal, according to its authors, is to “ensure a stable, secure and seamless” internet. Advocates hailed it as an important step toward an independent Russian internet, not reliant on traffic routed through other countries.

0~‘Attenberg,’ Athina Rachel Tsangari’s New Film~Movies and literature do not lack for coming-of-age stories about young women in odd circumstances, but “Attenberg,” Athina Rachel Tsangari’s new film, belongs in its own category. With an eccentric, beguiling blend of detachment and empathy — the camera sometimes lurking like a spy, sometimes trailing along like a shy, devoted friend — Ms. Tsangari observes the curious activities of Marina, a 23-year-old in the midst of an identity crisis that feels both highly idiosyncratic and weirdly familiar. Marina (Ariane Labed, a formidable Greek actress of French parentage who won best actress at the Venice Film Festival for this role) lives in a bleak, picturesque industrial town in Greece, and the film explores the relationships that occupy most of her time. Her father, Spyros (Vangelis Mourikis), an architect, is dying of an unspecified disease, and their conversations reveal an exquisitely gloomy sensibility, aspects of which he has passed on to his daughter. A world-weary, atheist intellectual, he seems to have given up not only on his own future but also on humanity as a whole. “Sometimes I think we are building ruins,” he says of his profession, and his surroundings confirm his pessimism. There is a quiet factory, a sad hotel, a scattering of high-rise buildings set in a mountainous coastal landscape that seems to be biding its time until the people and their follies disappear. Marina has no particular loyalty to her own species. An admirer of the nature documentaries of David Attenborough — the film’s title is a garbled reference to his name — she is an adept mimic of the ways of birds and apes. Her efforts to master human behavior are a bit more awkward, beginning with the film’s startling opening shot, in which Marina tries to learn kissing from her friend Bella (Evangelia Randou).
0~Diplomat Told House Investigators He Raised Alarm About Hunter Biden in 2015~WASHINGTON — A career State Department official told impeachment investigators this week that he raised concerns with a senior White House official in 2015 about the son of then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. But the warning from George P. Kent, then a State Department officer stationed in Kiev, was not acted on, according to two people familiar with Mr. Kent’s testimony. Mr. Kent, now of the State Department’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said he told the official that Hunter Biden’s position could look like a conflict of interest, given his father’s role, and would complicate American efforts to encourage Ukraine to clean up corruption. The White House official told Mr. Kent that the elder Mr. Biden did not have the “bandwidth” to address the concerns while his older son, Beau, was undergoing cancer treatment, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the private deposition. President Trump on Friday latched onto the rare bit of good news for him coming out of the House’s impeachment inquiry. Mr. Kent had also given Democrats plenty of fodder to drive their inquiry forward, but the emergence of any information that could tarnish the Bidens was welcome at the White House, even if White House officials have declared the inquiry illegitimate.
0~The Rising Heroes of the Coronavirus Era? Nations’ Top Scientists~BRUSSELS — If it weren’t the age of social distancing, people would stop them on the street to take selfies. Instead, they get adoring messages on social media. Others appear on television daily. The new celebrities emerging across Europe as the coronavirus burns a deadly path through the continent are not actors or singers or politicians. Instead, they are epidemiologists and virologists who have become household names after spending most of their lives in virtual anonymity. While nurses and doctors treat patients on the front lines, epidemiologists and virologists who have spent careers in lecture halls and laboratories have become the most trusted sources of information in an era of deep uncertainty, diverging policy and raging disinformation. After a long period of popular backlash against experts and expertise, which underpinned a sweep of political change and set off culture wars in much of the developed world, societies besieged by coronavirus isolation and desperate for facts are turning to these experts for answers, making them national heroes.

0~Central Park Penthouse Sets Record at Nearly $240 Million~The country’s most expensive home sale is now officially in the record books. Kenneth Griffin’s much-anticipated penthouse purchase at 220 Central Park South in Midtown Manhattan was recorded Jan. 25 with the New York City Registrar — just two days after representatives for the hedge fund manager and Vornado Realty Trust, the developer, signed the closing documents. The final price, with taxes and various fees added in, came to $239,958,219.15. This transaction was more than double New York City’s previous record, from four years ago: a duplex at the pinnacle of the One57 skyscraper that sold for nearly $100.5 million, reportedly to Michael Dell, the chief executive of Dell Technologies. And it far surpassed the national record-holder: an East Hampton, N.Y., estate that sold for $137 million in 2014 to Barry Rosenstein, another hedge fund manger. At the start of 2019, there were several other pricey closings in Manhattan’s newly opened luxury skyscrapers — though all appeared dwarfed by Mr. Griffin’s acquisition. A 9,100-square-foot duplex penthouse at 520 Park Avenue in Midtown sold for almost $64.3 million. (The purchase was financed with a $32.1 million mortgage.)
0~Behind the Sudden Death of a $1 Billion Secret C.I.A. War in Syria~Mr. Trump has twice publicly criticized the effort since he ended it. After The Washington Post first reported on his decision, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was ending “massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad.” During an interview with The Wall Street Journal last month, the president said many of the C.I.A.-supplied weapons ended up in the hands of “Al Qaeda” — presumably a reference to the Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, which often fought alongside the C.I.A.-backed rebels. Michael V. Hayden, a former C.I.A. director, said the president’s comments “might give the agency pause with regard to how much he will have their backs on any future covert actions.” Gen. Raymond A. Thomas III, the commander of United States Special Operations Command, said during a conference last month that ending the C.I.A. program was a “tough, tough decision.” “At least from what I know about that program and the decision to end it, it was absolutely not a sop to the Russians,” he said. “It was, I think, based on an assessment of the nature of the program, what we’re trying to accomplish, the viability of it going forward.” What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment. President Barack Obama had reluctantly agreed to the program in 2013 as the administration was struggling to blunt the momentum of Syrian government forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. It soon fell victim to the constantly shifting alliances in Syria’s six-year-old civil war and the limited visibility that American military and intelligence officials had over what was occurring on the ground. Once C.I.A.-trained fighters crossed into Syria, C.I.A. officers had difficulty controlling them. The fact that some of their C.I.A. weapons ended up with Nusra Front fighters — and that some of the rebels joined the group — confirmed the fears of many in the Obama administration when the program began. Although the Nusra Front was widely seen as an effective fighting force against Mr. Assad’s troops, its Qaeda affiliation made it impossible for the Obama administration to provide direct support for the group. American intelligence officials estimate that the Nusra Front now has as many as 20,000 fighters in Syria, making it Al Qaeda’s largest affiliate. Unlike other Qaeda affiliates such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Nusra Front has long focused on battling the Syrian government rather than plotting terrorist attacks against the United States and Europe.

0~What Happens to Women Who Are Denied Abortions?~S. went to First Resort the day before her appointment in Oakland, unsure what to expect. It provided a free ultrasound. The nurse asked S. if she wanted to see the baby and turned the monitor toward her: “Look! Your baby is smiling at you.” S. was shaken, convinced she also saw the baby smiling. The nurse told her that she was at least a week further along than the Planned Parenthood estimate (ultrasound estimates can be off by several days either way). S. sobbed all the way to her car and called the clinic in Oakland, giving it the First Resort estimate. If it was correct, they told her, she would be past its deadline. S. never made it to the Oakland clinic and in a matter of days gave up looking for another clinic that could perform a later procedure. She was out of gas money, hadn’t eaten a decent meal in weeks and resigned herself to the fact that, no matter what she wanted or how it would affect her life, she was going to have a baby. When Diana Greene Foster, a demographer and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco, first began studying women who were turned away from abortion clinics, she was struck by how little data there were. A few clinics kept records, but no one had compiled them nationally. And there was no research on how these women fared over time. What, Foster wondered, were the consequences of having to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term? Did it take a higher psychological or economic toll than having an abortion? Or was the reverse true — did the new baby make up for any social or financial difficulties? “It’s not that the study was so hard to do,” Foster says. But no one had done it before. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, the debate over abortion has focused primarily on the ramifications of having one. The abortion rights community maintains that abortion is safe, both physically and psychologically — a position most scientists endorse. Those on the anti-abortion side argue that abortion is immoral, can cause a fetus pain and leads to long-lasting negative physical and psychological effects in the women who have the procedure. There is no credible research to support a “post-abortion syndrome,” as a report published by the American Psychological Association in 2008 made clear. Yet the notion has influenced restrictive laws in many states. In Alabama, women who seek an abortion must have an ultrasound and be offered the option to view the image; in South Dakota, women must wait at least 72 hours after a consultation with a doctor before having the procedure. “The unstated assumption of most new abortion restrictions — mandatory ultrasound viewing, waiting periods, mandated state ‘information,’ ” Foster says, “is that women don’t know what they are doing when they try to terminate a pregnancy. Or they can’t make a decision they won’t regret.” Lost in the controversy, however, is the flip side of the question. What, Foster wondered, could the women who did not have the abortions they sought tell us about the women who did? Most studies on the effects of abortion compare women who have abortions with those who choose to carry their pregnancies to term. It is like comparing people who are divorced with people who stay married, instead of people who get the divorce they want with the people who don’t. Foster saw this as a fundamental flaw. By choosing the right comparison groups — women who obtain abortions just before the gestational deadline versus women who miss that deadline and are turned away — Foster hoped to paint a more accurate picture. Do the physical, psychological and socioeconomic outcomes for these two groups of women differ? Which is safer for them, abortion or childbirth? Which causes more depression and anxiety? “I tried to measure all the ways in which I thought having a baby might make you worse off,” Foster says, “and the ways in which having a baby might make you better off, and the same with having an abortion.” Foster began by gathering data locally. She ran the study out of her office at U.C.S.F. (I am a student in the U.C. Berkeley-U.C.S.F. Joint Medical Program but did not know Foster before reporting this article.) When the counselors at a nearby abortion clinic received a woman who was too far along to terminate her pregnancy, they called Foster, who would run over and arrange to interview the patient. Given the stigma attached to seeking an abortion later in pregnancy, Foster expected that many women would be reluctant to be part of her study. But four out of five women agreed to participate. “Sometimes, if you tell them that their experience is valuable, that it might help other people in their situation, they will come through,” she says. Initially, Foster’s study was confined to women whose pregnancies were in a narrow band of time on either side of this particular clinic’s gestational limit — two weeks under or three weeks over. (In California, state law allows an abortion up to what a physician considers viability, but clinics can set their own limits.) Eventually Foster received multiple foundation grants that allowed her to hire additional staff and recruit more subjects. The study, which is ongoing, encompasses 30 clinics from 21 states across the country. The clinics’ gestational limits vary from 10 weeks to the end of the second trimester, with a vast majority falling in the second trimester, typically defined as Weeks 14 to 26 of pregnancy. Women turned away from these “last stop” clinics had no other options within 150 miles. Of some 3,000 women who were asked to participate, 956 have completed a baseline interview and agreed to follow-up interviews every six months. Of those women, 452 were within two weeks of their facility’s cutoff and received an abortion, and 231 missed the cutoff by up to three weeks and were turned away. About 20 percent of the turnaways received an abortion elsewhere. Foster compared the remaining women who carried their pregnancies to term with the near-limit abortion patients. (The 273 other women in the study received a first-trimester abortion and acted as a control group. In the United States, 88 percent of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks, and Foster wanted to be sure that the near-limit abortion patients did not differ significantly in their outcomes from first-trimester abortion patients.) Of the turnaways in Foster’s study who gave birth, 9 percent eventually put their children up for adoption. There are many reasons women are turned away from an abortion clinic — lack of funds (many insurance plans don’t cover abortion) or obesity (excess weight can make the procedure more complicated) — but most simply arrive too late. Women cite not recognizing their pregnancies, travel and procedure costs, insurance problems and not knowing where to find care as common reasons for delay. These are the women for whom “society has the absolute least sympathy,” Foster acknowledges. While a majority of Americans (53 percent) agree with Roe, many of those who support abortion rights draw the line at later stages of pregnancy. And the law reflects this view. Roe v. Wade guarantees a woman’s right to abortion only up to the “viability” of a fetus, with exceptions for danger to a woman’s health. (Viability varies depending on the medical expert you ask, typically at 23 weeks or more.) But the widespread discomfort with abortions near viability is reflected in recent bans on so-called partial-birth abortions. And many clinics, reacting to state law, set their own gestational limits — often 20 to 22 weeks — making later-term abortion more difficult to find in some states than in others. (In the U.S., 87 percent of counties have no abortion provider at all.)
0~After Capitol Riot, Lawmakers Chafe at Security Measures~There are also bipartisan calls to dismiss the National Guard troops who have remained at the Capitol since first being deployed there on the day of the attack. The top Democrat and Republican on the House Armed Services Committee issued a joint statement this week saying they were “deeply troubled” by the security posture at the Capitol, arguing that it was excessive, costly and could cause readiness problems for the National Guard. “As the U.S. Capitol Police continues to build its personnel capacity, there is no doubt that some level of support from the National Guard should remain in the National Capital Region to respond to credible threats against the Capitol,” wrote Representatives Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the committee’s chairman, and Mike D. Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican. “However, the present security posture is not warranted at this time.” The issue has laid bare a divide between many lawmakers who want the Capitol to return to a sense of normalcy and the police and law enforcement officials who are tasked with protecting them. No lawmakers were injured during the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, though some had close calls. But nearly 140 officers suffered injuries during the assault, which left five people dead. The tension is a familiar phenomenon in Washington, where past attacks and security incidents at the nation’s most iconic national buildings — the Capitol and the White House — have led to increasingly robust fortifications around both, often prompting controversy. In the case of the Capitol, the recent security measures have been particularly jarring, closing off roads, walkways and nearly 60 acres of picturesque, parklike grounds that surround the building where Congress meets.

That doesn’t mean we are going to agree to it, but all they have to do is make a deal.” The Postal Service has said regularly that it can handle any surge in volume from mail balloting this fall. More than three-quarters of voters will be able to cast their ballots by mail this year. Mr. Trump has assailed the money-losing Postal Service in recent months, at the same time warning that voting by mail will lead to fraud, lost or stolen ballots and long delays in determining a winner. (On Wednesday, both the president and the first lady, Melania Trump, were mailed ballots, Palm Beach County, Fla., election records show. It was first reported by The Palm Beach Post. Late Thursday, Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said, “The president supports absentee voting, not universal mail-in voting, which contain several safeguards that prevent fraud and abuse.”) The appointment as postmaster general in May of Louis DeJoy, a Trump campaign contributor with significant financial interests in the Postal Service’s competitors and contractors, has prompted further concerns about the politicization of the agency, particularly after Mr. DeJoy put in place policy changes that have slowed mail delivery in some areas.

0~Drone Strike Video Shows Killing of Civilians in Afghanistan~[explosion] In one of the final acts of its 20-year war in Afghanistan, the United States fired a missile from a drone at a car in Kabul. It was parked in the courtyard of a home, and the explosion killed 10 people, including 43-year-old Zemari Ahmadi and seven children, according to his family. The Pentagon claimed that Ahmadi was a facilitator for the Islamic State, and that his car was packed with explosives, posing an imminent threat to U.S. troops guarding the evacuation at the Kabul airport. “The procedures were correctly followed, and it was a righteous strike.” What the military apparently didn’t know was that Ahmadi was a longtime aid worker, who colleagues and family members said spent the hours before he died running office errands, and ended his day by pulling up to his house. Soon after, his Toyota was hit with a 20-pound Hellfire missile. What was interpreted as the suspicious moves of a terrorist may have just been an average day in his life. And it’s possible that what the military saw Ahmadi loading into his car were water canisters he was bringing home to his family — not explosives. Using never-before seen security camera footage of Ahmadi, interviews with his family, co-workers and witnesses, we will piece together for the first time his movements in the hours before he was killed. Zemari Ahmadi was an electrical engineer by training. For 14 years, he had worked for the Kabul office of Nutrition and Education International. “NEI established a total of 11 soybean processing plants in Afghanistan.” It’s a California based NGO that fights malnutrition. On most days, he drove one of the company’s white Toyota corollas, taking his colleagues to and from work and distributing the NGO’s food to Afghans displaced by the war. Only three days before Ahmadi was killed, 13 U.S. troops and more than 170 Afghan civilians died in an Islamic State suicide attack at the airport. The military had given lower-level commanders the authority to order airstrikes earlier in the evacuation, and they were bracing for what they feared was another imminent attack. To reconstruct Ahmadi’s movements on Aug. 29, in the hours before he was killed, The Times pieced together the security camera footage from his office, with interviews with more than a dozen of Ahmadi’s colleagues and family members. Ahmadi appears to have left his home around 9 a.m. He then picked up a colleague and his boss’s laptop near his house. It’s around this time that the U.S. military claimed it observed a white sedan leaving an alleged Islamic State safehouse, around five kilometers northwest of the airport. That’s why the U.S. military said they tracked Ahmadi’s Corolla that day. They also said they intercepted communications from the safehouse, instructing the car to make several stops. But every colleague who rode with Ahmadi that day said what the military interpreted as a series of suspicious moves was just a typical day in his life. After Ahmadi picked up another colleague, the three stopped to get breakfast, and at 9:35 a.m., they arrived at the N.G.O.’s office. Later that morning, Ahmadi drove some of his co-workers to a Taliban-occupied police station to get permission for future food distribution at a new displacement camp. At around 2 p.m., Ahmadi and his colleagues returned to the office. The security camera footage we obtained from the office is crucial to understanding what happens next. The camera’s timestamp is off, but we went to the office and verified the time. We also matched an exact scene from the footage with a timestamp satellite image to confirm it was accurate. A 2:35 p.m., Ahmadi pulls out a hose, and then he and a co-worker fill empty containers with water. Earlier that morning, we saw Ahmadi bring these same empty plastic containers to the office. There was a water shortage in his neighborhood, his family said, so he regularly brought water home from the office. At around 3:38 p.m., a colleague moves Ahmadi’s car further into the driveway. A senior U.S. official told us that at roughly the same time, the military saw Ahmadi’s car pull into an unknown compound 8 to 12 kilometers southwest of the airport. That overlaps with the location of the NGO’s office, which we believe is what the military called an unknown compound. With the workday ending, an employee switched off the office generator and the feed from the camera ends. We don’t have footage of the moments that followed. But it’s at this time, the military said that its drone feed showed four men gingerly loading wrapped packages into the car. Officials said they couldn’t tell what was inside them. This footage from earlier in the day shows what the men said they were carrying — their laptops one in a plastic shopping bag. And the only things in the trunk, Ahmadi’s co-workers said, were the water containers. Ahmadi dropped each one of them off, then drove to his home in a dense neighborhood near the airport. He backed into the home’s small courtyard. Children surrounded the car, according to his brother. A U.S. official said the military feared the car would leave again, and go into an even more crowded street or to the airport itself. The drone operators, who hadn’t been watching Ahmadi’s home at all that day, quickly scanned the courtyard and said they saw only one adult male talking to the driver and no children. They decided this was the moment to strike. A U.S. official told us that the strike on Ahmadi’s car was conducted by an MQ-9 Reaper drone that fired a single Hellfire missile with a 20-pound warhead. We found remnants of the missile, which experts said matched a Hellfire at the scene of the attack. In the days after the attack, the Pentagon repeatedly claimed that the missile strike set off other explosions, and that these likely killed the civilians in the courtyard. “Significant secondary explosions from the targeted vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.” “Because there were secondary explosions, there’s a reasonable conclusion to be made that there was explosives in that vehicle.” But a senior military official later told us that it was only possible to probable that explosives in the car caused another blast. We gathered photos and videos of the scene taken by journalists and visited the courtyard multiple times. We shared the evidence with three weapons experts who said the damage was consistent with the impact of a Hellfire missile. They pointed to the small crater beneath Ahmadi’s car and the damage from the metal fragments of the warhead. This plastic melted as a result of a car fire triggered by the missile strike. All three experts also pointed out what was missing: any evidence of the large secondary explosions described by the Pentagon. No collapsed or blown-out walls, including next to the trunk with the alleged explosives. No sign that a second car parked in the courtyard was overturned by a large blast. No destroyed vegetation. All of this matches what eyewitnesses told us, that a single missile exploded and triggered a large fire. There is one final detail visible in the wreckage: containers identical to the ones that Ahmadi and his colleague filled with water and loaded into his trunk before heading home. Even though the military said the drone team watched the car for eight hours that day, a senior official also said they weren’t aware of any water containers. The Pentagon has not provided The Times with evidence of explosives in Ahmadi’s vehicle or shared what they say is the intelligence that linked him to the Islamic State. But the morning after the U.S. killed Ahmadi, the Islamic State did launch rockets at the airport from a residential area Ahmadi had driven through the previous day. And the vehicle they used … … was a white Toyota. The U.S. military has so far acknowledged only three civilian deaths from its strike, and says there is an investigation underway. They have also admitted to knowing nothing about Ahmadi before killing him, leading them to interpret the work of an engineer at a U.S. NGO as that of an Islamic State terrorist. Four days before Ahmadi was killed, his employer had applied for his family to receive refugee resettlement in the United States. At the time of the strike, they were still awaiting approval. Looking to the U.S. for protection, they instead became some of the last victims in America’s longest war. “Hi, I’m Evan, one of the producers on this story. Our latest visual investigation began with word on social media of an explosion near Kabul airport. It turned out that this was a U.S. drone strike, one of the final acts in the 20-year war in Afghanistan. Our goal was to fill in the gaps in the Pentagon’s version of events. We analyzed exclusive security camera footage, and combined it with eyewitness accounts and expert analysis of the strike aftermath.

0~With Xi’s Power Grab, China Joins New Era of Strongmen~This is the idea that took over the world. First there was one democracy — then 10, then 20. There were some setbacks, but people really seemed to want democracy. And eventually, most of them got one. But 15 years ago, democracy stopped spreading, and it might not pick back up again. Even some places that seemed safely democratic turned out not to be. And people are even getting worried about established democracies like the U.S. So is there something wrong with democracy? I’m Max Fisher. I’m Amanda Taub. We’re journalists at The New York Times. And this is the Interpreter. We can measure democracy kind of like a health score. Over here, there are full democracies like the United States. And over there are dictatorships like North Korea. So the further left a country is, the less democratic it is and the further right a country, the more democratic it is. Now let’s see what happens when we add how rich the countries are. The higher on the graph, the richer the country and the lower on the graph, the poorer the country. Generally, countries have moved up and right. As they got richer, they became more democratic. You’ve got your Englands, your Latvias, your Indonesias. You see a pattern? Countries getting richer. Countries getting more democratic. But look at countries like China and Saudi Arabia. They got richer, but never got more democratic. Look at Russia and Venezuela. They got democratic, but then backslid, which wasn’t supposed to happen. So what’s going on? China looked exactly like places we thought would become democracies next. They built up the rule of law, civil society and some institutions. Normally, those are the building blocks that eventually add up to democracy. But they were really designed to make citizens just happy enough to protect the authoritarian system from the will of the people. And whenever the government feels like it could lose control, it uses the other side of its strategy: violent oppression and coercion. We’re seeing this in more places where dictators are learning how to stop democracy from forming. And at the same time, some elected leaders are developing their own playbook for pulling democratic systems down from within. A handful of seemingly established democracies are sliding back towards dictatorship. These countries didn’t have coups or invasions. In each case, voters elected strongman leaders who dismantled their democracies from within. Venezuela had been democratic for 40 years, then Hugo Chavez rose on a message that only he spoke for the people. People cheered as he accrued power for himself, jailed his opponents and tore down the democratic institutions that constrained him. And when the dust settled, Chavez was unchecked. Society descended into chaos that is getting worse every day. Other elected leaders are using similar tactics, but always bit by bit — in ways that aren’t obvious and might even be popular at the time. One of the most powerful forces that can turn people against democracy is polarization. When people feel scared enough of their political opponents, it feels more important to protect their side than it does to protect democracy. Leaders can exploit that fear. So if you’re Russian and you support Putin, you might blame society’s problems on gay people or nefarious Western plots. If you’re Turkish and support Erdogan, you fear the secular elites will impose military rule. And we’re seeing that kind of polarization and fear start to take hold in established democracies. “You are a racist, no good American.” “I was just called a racist.” Could it happen in the United States? It still feels impossible. And it might be. So far, the system is resilient. But the warning signs are here. Polarization. Populism. Distrust of institutions. A desire for strongman leaders to smash the system. These things don’t necessarily mean that democracy is doomed. But they show that in times of social stress, even a free people can dismantle their own democracy without realizing they’re doing it. Democracy is still a pretty new system of government. That century-long trend might not have been a trend at all. Just a few one-time moments that we mistook for inevitability. We want to believe it will last forever, but we can’t be sure.
0~Hospital Fires Outrage Iraqis, but They See Little Hope for Change~NASIRIYA, Iraq — The provincial civil defense chief, Brig. Gen. Salah Jabar, had warned for months about the problems in local hospitals before a fire in a coronavirus ward in this southern city killed at least 60 people this week. He flagged the flammable construction materials, a lack of fire detectors and improperly stored oxygen canisters. But his repeated warnings to the regional health ministry were ignored, he said. Then he heard from his mother. A week ago, she was being treated for Covid-19 in the same hospital hit by the lethal blaze in the southern city of Nasiriya, and while she was recovering in a different isolation ward, two small fires broke out there. “My mother told me about it and said: ‘It’s better if you get me out of here. This place scares me,’” General Jabar said on Wednesday. Although she was still ill, he said, he had her discharged and took her home, just days before the deadly fire at the Imam Hussein Teaching Hospital.
0~Mike Pence Closes Out Night 3 of the G.O.P. Convention, Making the Case for Trump~Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:25 - 0:00 transcript Mike Pence Accepts Nomination and Attacks Joe Biden In making his case for another Trump term, the vice president spoke of President Trump’s character “when the cameras are off.” So with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican Party and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as vice president of the United States. Over the past four years, I’ve had the privilege to work closely with our president. I’ve seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways. But there’s no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is: a nation that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, he’s not your man. Last week, Joe Biden didn’t say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country. So let me be clear: The violence must stop — whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha. Too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. In making his case for another Trump term, the vice president spoke of President Trump’s character “when the cameras are off.” Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times For four years, Vice President Mike Pence has stood as an unfailingly loyal deputy to President Trump — even and especially when he gets overruled. In public and private, Mr. Pence lauds Mr. Trump. And on Wednesday night, he used his convention speech to paint the president as a great builder of the American economy and defender of American law enforcement. The vice president said that Mr. Trump was upholding the very nature of the country, and if Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president, the United States would lose its essential character and become unrecognizable — at least to a Trump-friendly social conservative like Mr. Pence. “Last week, Joe Biden said democracy is on the ballot, but the truth is, our economic recovery is on the ballot, law and order are on the ballot. But so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country,” Mr. Pence said. “It’s not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrat. The choice in this election is whether America remains America.” “So with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican Party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as vice president of the United States,” Mr. Pence said. Speaking to a crowd at Fort McHenry in Baltimore that did not appear to be socially distanced or wearing masks, Mr. Pence described a president who acts differently in private than he does in public — a picture sharply at odds with nearly all of the reporting that depicts Mr. Trump in private as even more prone to pique and outbursts than he is before television cameras. “I’ve seen him when the cameras are off,” Mr. Pence said. “Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways, but there’s no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is, a nation that has done more good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance.” Mr. Pence made the night’s first significant reference to Hurricane Laura, a major storm bearing down on Texas and Louisiana, a notion that would have not raised eyebrows during any other political convention but seemed off-key during a week devoted to singing the praises of Mr. Trump. “This is a serious storm, and we urge all of those in the affected areas to heed state and local authorities,” Mr. Pence said. “Stay safe, and know that we will be with you every step of the way to support, rescue, respond, and recover in the days and weeks ahead.” In a seeming reference to Mr. Trump’s defense of Confederate monuments and the Confederate flag, Mr. Pence, who is from Indiana, added: “If you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, then he’s not your man.” Mr. Pence was the only Republican convention speaker to mention Kenosha, Wis., where the Sunday police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake, has inflamed racial tensions. He condemned people there who caused property damage — though he made no mention of the shooting that prompted the unrest. “President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peacefully protest,” said Mr. Pence, who in 2017 flew to Indianapolis for an N.F.L. game and then walked out after several players knelt during the national anthem. “But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” Mr. Pence, like many speakers during the Republican convention, also sought to rewrite the recent history of how Mr. Trump has handled the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed nearly 180,000 Americans and counting. “Before the first case of the coronavirus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world,” Mr. Pence said. Yet by April 40,000 people had traveled to the United States from China since Mr. Trump imposed his travel ban on Jan. 31, and more than 430,000 since the coronavirus was first disclosed in China a month earlier. Mr. Pence also said Mr. Trump had “marshaled the full resources of our federal government from the outset,” adding, “He directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America in both political parties.” This would come as a surprise to Democratic governors in Illinois, New York and Washington State, among others, who found themselves on the receiving end of Mr. Trump’s attacks for publicly criticizing the federal government’s inability to produce personal protective equipment or sufficient testing to determine how far the virus had spread in their states.
0~2 Democrats Split on Tactics to Fight Military Sex Assaults~WASHINGTON — A sweeping Pentagon policy bill that would make significant changes to how the military deals with sexual assault has turned into a battle between two powerful and determined Democrats who have offered competing proposals. The two, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, are lobbying fellow lawmakers on the Senate floor — sometimes when there is no way to gracefully escape — papering senators’ offices with letters from victims, and nudging them for meetings to press their cases. “This one is near the top,” Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said when asked to assess the intensity of the in-house campaigns on the legislation, which is scheduled to go before the Senate soon. “I would say they both have very strong opinions.” At issue is how much power military commanders would maintain in sexual assault cases. For many Democrats, the conflict has created an uncomfortable division between the Senate’s women, whose ranks and power have increased significantly since 2012. The choice is particularly difficult for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who has feared alienating his female members on legislative issues and is fond of both Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. McCaskill.
0~2 Cabdrivers Are Disciplined for Refusing to Take Puerto Rican Mayor to the Bronx~One New York City taxicab driver has lost his license and another was fined for refusing to drive the mayor of San Juan, P.R., from Manhattan to a hotel in the Bronx last month, officials said. Jose A. Guerrero, 67, was fined $200 for refusing to take Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz from Greenwich Village to the Opera House Hotel on East 149th Street in the Bronx on May 27, officials from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission said. Mr. Guerrero, who paid his fine on June 10, has been driving a cab in the city for decades and had no prior offenses, the commission said. The second driver, Mohamed Mansouri, 32, initially refused to drive Ms. Cruz and three of her colleagues to the Bronx, but then reluctantly agreed to do so, officials said. The commission revoked his license and fined him $1,450, noting that he had four previous consumer complaints on his record, including refusal and overcharging. “He took us there, and all the while he was complaining that he was going to the Bronx,” Ms. Cruz had previously told reporters. She was not immediately available at her office on Friday afternoon.
0~Hong Kong Protest: Clashes With Police Turn Downtown Into Tear Gas-Filled Battlefield~HONG KONG — For the second day in a row, thousands rallied on Sunday in Hong Kong to protest mob violence and what they say is police brutality against peaceful marchers. And for the second consecutive day, the police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the throngs. On Saturday, riot police officers unleashed pepper spray and rubber bullets and clashed briefly with demonstrators in a train station in a northern town. Barely 24 hours later, clashes erupted again that turned parts of downtown Hong Kong into a tear gas-filled battlefield as riot officers beat back demonstrators who tried to approach the Chinese government’s representative office in the territory. The police on Sunday fired dozens of rounds of tear gas starting from about 7 p.m. and charged protesters, sending hundreds of bystanders who were watching nearby scrambling for shelter. Groups of riot officers with clubs chased black-clad protesters down alleys in the dense urban district. In some areas, as the police sought to disperse the demonstrators, they beat them with batons and shields, pressed them to the ground and cuffed them. Some protesters appeared injured. The police said protesters had thrown bricks and other hard objects as they charged police lines.
0~Tillerson Comes Up Short in Effort to Resolve Qatar Dispute~“I’m tired, I’m tired, been a long trip,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters on his plane after leaving Doha on Thursday. Asked what most surprised him in his new job, he said, “Well, it is a lot different than being C.E.O. of Exxon because I was the ultimate decision maker. That always makes life easier.” He spoke fondly of the discipline that marks the oil giant’s decision-making process. “That allows you to accomplish a lot, to accomplish a lot in a very efficient way,” he said. “Those are not the characteristics of the United States government,” Mr. Tillerson said. “And I don’t say that as a criticism; it’s just an observation of fact. It’s largely not a highly disciplined organization, decision making is fragmented, and sometimes people don’t want to take decisions, coordination is difficult through the interagency — has been for every administration.” He added that “we have a president that doesn’t come from the political world either.” Much of Mr. Tillerson’s focus since taking office has been on an effort to restructure the State Department, but the extended process and proposed deep budget cuts have resulted in a mixture of bewilderment and fierce opposition even among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Despite these difficulties, Mr. Tillerson decided to try his hand at shuttle diplomacy this week. But after three days of sipping tea with royalty on white coaches in ornate palaces, he said that a solution remains far off. “Right now, the parties are not even talking to one another at any level,” he said of the dispute between Qatar and four Persian Gulf countries, led by Saudi Arabia. Some of the issues that led the four to impose an embargo against Qatar are so complex that the “ultimate resolution may take quite a while,” he added.
0~From Fracking to Finance, a Torrent of Campaign Cash~A look at some of the business, personal and ideological ties that bind megadonors in the 2016 presidential campaign. The Frackers The great American energy boom of the last decade has produced a wave of new billionaires and multimillionaires. Now they are throwing tens of millions of dollars into the presidential campaign, with the biggest checks going almost exclusively to Republicans and their “super PACs.” The top donors include Trevor Rees-Jones, who left a law practice in Dallas and turned $4,000 in savings into an energy empire as the head of Chief Oil and Gas; Dan and Farris Wilks, abortion opponents whose trucking and equipment business struck gold in the fracking boom; and Karen Buchwald Wright, the head of Ariel Corporation, an Ohio manufacturer of gas compressors. Old Oil Established Texas oil families are deeply involved in the campaign, too. Descendants of the late gambler and oil speculator H.L. Hunt – once thought to be the richest man in America – account for at least $2.3 million in donations in this presidential campaign. Mr. Hunt’s fortune, feuds and multiple marriages are the stuff of legend: In the late 1970s, two of his sons reputedly tried to corner the silver market, and some say the Hunts inspired the classic television series “Dallas.” At least three of his descendants have followed his path in Republican politics in the 2016 campaign. Among them is Ray Lee Hunt, the sole surviving Hunt heir with enough wealth to make the Forbes list of billionaires. (Mr. Hunt is No. 92 in the United States.) The family business, Hunt Oil, remains among the largest privately held oil companies in the country. Mr. Hunt and his wife have put more than $2 million behind Mr. Bush. Hedge Fund Partners, Political Opposites They may disagree on politics, but they earned fortunes together. The hedge fund investor George Soros, who earned $1 billion in a bet against the British pound in 1992, is a prominent liberal donor and philanthropist who has given $1 million to a super PAC backing Hillary Rodham Clinton. His partner on that trade was Stanley F. Druckenmiller, who would become a prominent hedge fund manager in his own right, and is now close to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican. Mr. Druckenmiller is a strong advocate of reduced spending on entitlement programs, which he has called “current seniors stealing from future seniors.” He has put a total of more than $300,000 behind Mr. Christie, Jeb Bush and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio.
0~Duncan Hunter Airs Ad Suggesting Opponent Is Terrorist Sympathizer~Representative Duncan Hunter, the California Republican whose re-election campaign has been imperiled by a federal indictment, has released a startling attack against his Democratic challenger, suggesting that he is an Islamic terrorist sympathizer and national security risk. “Ammar Campa-Najjar is working to infiltrate Congress,” says the narrator of Mr. Hunter’s ad, released on YouTube, in reference to the Democrat running against him. “He’s used three different names to hide his family’s ties to terrorism.” Mr. Campa-Najjar, who until Mr. Hunter’s troubles was considered a very long shot to win a predominantly Republican district in the San Diego suburbs, has a Mexican-American mother and a father who immigrated from the Middle East. His paternal grandfather, Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar, was involved with the plan to murder Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games in Germany in 1972; he was assassinated by Israeli military commandos in 1973.
0~Mulvaney Downgrades Student Loan Unit in Consumer Bureau Reshuffle~WASHINGTON — Mick Mulvaney, the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will move the agency’s student loan division into the bureau’s consumer information unit, a shift that career officials fear will sidetrack a major enforcement case the agency is pursuing against Navient, the nation’s largest student loan collector. The change, outlined in an email sent to the bureau’s staff Wednesday morning, is part of an effort by Mr. Mulvaney to refocus the agency away from its consumer finance enforcement and rule-writing mission and more toward providing consumers with information about their legal rights. It follows a similar move Mr. Mulvaney made in February, when he folded the bureau’s fair lending division into the consumer unit, telling staff it would “continue to focus on advocacy, coordination and education.” Among the bureau’s career staff, the shift was regarded as a new attack on one of the bureau’s core statutory functions, and another attempt by Mr. Mulvaney and his team to dismantle a consumer watchdog reviled by President Trump.
0~Trump Spurns Medicaid Proposal After Furious White House Debate~Several states would like to expand Medicaid in a more limited way, capping eligibility at the poverty level, or $12,140 for an individual. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, eligibility varies. Parents with incomes over half the poverty level are often ineligible, and most adults without dependent children are ineligible, no matter how poor they are. The push touched off intense debate inside the Trump administration. Supporting the option were Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services; Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and Andrew Bremberg, the director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House. On the other side were Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers; and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. Mr. Azar and Ms. Verma had been discussing the idea with the White House for several months, but were unable to persuade Mr. Mulvaney and his allies, who shot down the proposal in two meetings at the end of last week, with the president’s blessing, administration officials said.

Paradoxically, Mr. Trump reached the same conclusion as President Barack Obama for a completely different reason. Mr. Obama refused to allow partial expansion of Medicaid because he wanted states to go for the full expansion envisioned in the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump opposed any expansion of “Obamacare,” even a partial one. Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said on Monday: “We do not comment on internal deliberations or the particulars of any waiver requests. H.H.S. has been working on waivers to help states have more flexibility and provide patients access to affordable health care.” Under the proposal, the Trump administration would have offered more waivers to states, so they could devise and run their own health programs with federal money that would otherwise be available under the Affordable Care Act.
0~U.S. Warships Sail Taiwan Strait, Defying Chinese Pressure~HONG KONG — The U.S. Navy said that two of its warships sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, the first such passage by American ships since China began large-scale military exercises in response to a visit to Taiwan by Speaker Nancy Pelosi early this month. The guided-missile cruisers Antietam and Chancellorsville were conducting what the Navy’s Seventh Fleet called “a routine Taiwan Strait transit.” American officials said this month that the Navy would continue to operate around Taiwan, despite China’s claims to control the waterway. China has warned the United States against sailing warships in the Taiwan Strait and said that it would respond to what it considers threats to its sovereignty. The Chinese military said on Sunday in a statement that it had monitored the ships’ passage but did not indicate any additional response. “Eastern theater forces remain on high alert, ready to thwart any provocation,” it said. After Ms. Pelosi visited Taiwan on Aug. 2-3, China launched missiles into waters that are part of Japan’s exclusive economic zone and carried out 72 hours of live fire exercises around Taiwan that simulated a potential blockade of the island. China considers self-governed Taiwan to be part of its territory, although the Communist Party has never controlled the island.
0~Iran Is Accused of Hiding Suspected Nuclear Activity~Under the 2015 agreement, Iranian officials shipped 97 percent of their existing stockpile of low-enriched uranium out of the country. And the nuclear agency’s latest assessment of Iran’s enrichment activities concludes that while it is violating the limits imposed in the 2015 accord, it would still take months to fashion its uranium stockpile into something that could be used to produce a single nuclear weapon. It also would take months or years more to produce the weapon. The vote by the International Atomic Energy Agency came as no surprise to the Iranians, who have been jousting with inspectors over whether they are required to provide access under its agreements for nuclear transparency. Ahead of the vote, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, warned on Thursday that a resolution by the international body would “ruin” prospects for what he described as an “agreeable solution.” He also accused enemies of the nuclear deal of conspiring with international inspectors who had audited more Iranian nuclear sites “over the last five years than in I.A.E.A. history.” “We’ve nothing to hide,” Mr. Zarif wrote on Twitter. Brian H. Hook, the State Department’s special envoy for Iran policy, called that claim laughable. “If only that were true,” he said. The issue is not how many sites inspectors have visited but which ones. Several that were previously unknown were identified after a bold raid on Tehran in early 2018 where agents of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency broke into a warehouse and seized thousands of long-hidden files about Iran’s early nuclear efforts, some stretching back nearly two decades. Since then, the Israelis have shared some — but not all — of the findings with international inspectors, including the location of one major site, which Israeli officials called the Abadeh Nuclear Weapons Development Site. Experiments using conventional explosives are believed to have been conducted there.
0~Dodd Calls for Hollywood and Silicon Valley to Meet~WASHINGTON — When Jack Valenti walked the halls of Congress, friends by the dozen gripped, grinned and took note of what was worrying the movie industry’s dapper chief lobbyist. Christopher J. Dodd now fills Mr. Valenti’s shoes. But he stays out of those halls, thanks to restrictions on his ability to lobby Congress until 2013. It just cost him a big one. A major push by copyright holders — including those in the Motion Picture Association of America, of which Mr. Dodd is chairman — for a tough federal law to control foreign online piracy collapsed this week under stiff resistance from technology companies and their allies. On Wednesday, as Web sites expressed opposition to the legislation, important lawmakers withdrew their support, leaving Mr. Dodd and his associates scrambling to find what could be salvaged.
0~South Korea Warns of Another Covid-19 Outbreak Tied to a Church~SEOUL, South Korea — Health officials in South Korea reported 279 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, warning of a resurgence of infections, many linked to a church that has vocally opposed President Moon Jae-in. South Korea had battled the epidemic down to two-digit daily caseloads since April. But the number of new cases has soared recently, with 103 on Friday and 166 on Saturday, most of them worshipers at the Sarang Jeil Church in Seoul, the capital, and another church in the surrounding province of Gyeonggi. The church outbreaks have alarmed health officials. Tightly packed, fervent prayer services in some South Korean churches have made them particularly vulnerable to the virus. When South Korea was hit by its first wave of the coronavirus in late February and early March, the epidemic spread mainly from the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the central city of Daegu, about 150 miles southeast of Seoul. The church has been accused of being a cult by more mainstream churches. During the first wave of infections, the daily caseload across the country was as high as 909.
0~Baghdadi of ISIS Pushes an Islamist Crusade~BAGHDAD — When American forces raided a home near Falluja during the turbulent 2004 offensive against the Iraqi Sunni insurgency, they got the hard-core militants they had been looking for. They also picked up an apparent hanger-on, an Iraqi man in his early 30s whom they knew nothing about. The Americans duly registered his name as they processed him and the others at the Camp Bucca detention center: Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badry. That once-peripheral figure has become known to the world now as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-appointed caliph of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and the architect of its violent campaign to redraw the map of the Middle East. “He was a street thug when we picked him up in 2004,” said a Pentagon official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. “It’s hard to imagine we could have had a crystal ball then that would tell us he’d become head of ISIS.”
0~As Prime Minister, Boris Johnson Faces the Brexit He Championed~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” After trying and failing to deliver Brexit, British Prime Minister Theresa May will resign this week. Today: The story of how the man expected to succeed her made Brexit, and how Brexit is now making him prime minister. It’s Monday, July 22. archived recording (theresa may) I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honor of my life to hold. I do so with no ill will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love. [music] michael barbaro Sarah, catch me up on what happened after that moment when Theresa May announces that she’s stepping down. sarah lyall Well, it touched off an immediate mad scramble over who would replace her. And under party rules, the next party leader is chosen only by members of the Conservative Party. And it’s they who will be selecting the next leader of the party and thus the next prime minister of the U.K. michael barbaro And who is expected to be at this point? sarah lyall At this point, it’s a shoo-in for Boris Johnson. Unless something bizarre happens, he will be the next prime minister. archived recording [MUSIC] michael barbaro And Sarah, who is Boris Johnson? archived recording He is the Conservative M.P. for Henley. He’s editor of The Spectator. And it seems he’s 92 times better than me at hosting topical news quizzes. Ladies and gentlemen, Boris Johnson. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] sarah lyall He is a celebrity politician. archived recording (boris johnson) This is a totally ecumenical cross-party venture, my friends. Now, this is a once in a lifetime chance. sarah lyall And he is extraordinarily visible by the way he looks. He has a massive shock of bright white hair. archived recording And how long have you been cutting your own hair? [LAUGHTER] archived recording (boris johnson) I think that was a low blow. sarah lyall He’s incredibly articulate. archived recording (boris johnson) Are you saying they haven’t the guts to put questions to me? Great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies. sarah lyall He’s incredibly funny. He’s incredibly charming. archived recording Have you snorted cocaine? [LAUGHTER] archived recording (boris johnson) I tried to. archived recording You’ve tried to snort cocaine? archived recording (boris johnson) Unsuccessfully, a long time ago. [LAUGHTER] archived recording Sir, what are you thinking? archived recording (boris johnson) I sneezed. archived recording What was unsuccessful about it? archived recording (boris johnson) I sneezed. [LAUGHTER] sarah lyall He’s also incredibly — what the Brits would call shambolic. He doesn’t get to places on time. He’s disorganized. He’s ill-prepared. He can’t remember what meeting he’s at and what he’s supposed to be doing. archived recording (boris johnson) We’ve got a fantastic guy called — oh, he’s brilliant. It’s either — he’s a superb man — Sterling, Gurling, something like that. What’s he called? Come on, what is it again? Tell me the name. Come on. archived recording You should get it. No, serious, it’s not my job to — archived recording (boris johnson) Stop sitting there like a great, big, fat Buddha and tell me the name of this guy. michael barbaro Sarah, when I think of British government, and certainly when I think about the prime minister, I think of a certain level of kind of stuffy formality and sobriety. How does this person that you’re describing, how does that person become the first in line to become prime minister? sarah lyall So there’s really two ways to look at him. He is all those things. He is bumbling. He is shambolic. But at the same time, a lot of his moves over his career have been quite calculated. It’s often been in the service of either getting attention or getting power. So for example, he started as a journalist. michael barbaro What was his reputation as a journalist? sarah lyall Well, very entertaining. He’s really funny and inaccurate. And he would write articles about the European Union, where he’d exaggerate and sort of cast the European Union as this terrible bureaucracy, trying to take things away from citizens. It was sort of the stuff that made no sense. It was like, the E.U. was going to regulate condoms and make them all one-size-fits-all. michael barbaro [LAUGHS] sarah lyall And it was going to ban shrimp-flavored potato chips. michael barbaro And it was going to really do neither. sarah lyall No, it was going to do neither. And the other journalists who were covering the same things would be yelled at by their editors, who would say, why aren’t you covering the same stuff Boris is? And he set a tone for the coverage of the European Union. It was just wrong. And when he was asked about it, he said, it doesn’t matter what the facts are that you marshal in service of that thesis. The thesis is right. archived recording [MUSIC] sarah lyall And he talked about it once. He went on a program called “Desert Island Discs,” which is a BBC program where you talk about your favorite music. archived recording My castaway this week is a politician and a journalist, prone to getting into scrapes, a word that suits his rather Wodehousian image. sarah lyall And he was talking about his coverage. And he said — archived recording (boris johnson) See, everything I wrote from Brussels I find was sort of — I was just chucking these rocks over the garden wall, and there’s an amazing crash from the greenhouse next door over in England. Everything I wrote from Brussels were having this amazing, explosive effect on the Tory Party. And it really gave me this, I suppose, rather weird sense of power. archived recording But this made your reputation as a journalist, didn’t it? sarah lyall It started to inform the Tory Party’s attitude toward Europe. And so he was welcomed by them as someone really telling the truth about Europe for the first time. michael barbaro So he was finding an audience among Britain’s conservatives? sarah lyall Yes. michael barbaro And was he himself actually a conservative? sarah lyall Yeah, he was always a conservative. But there are different strains in the Conservative Party. And at least in the beginning, it seemed his biggest motivation was to get in Parliament, and that way to start building a base toward having more power. But at that point, it was sort of unclear what his convictions were. And as he said in an interview at the time, when he was asked what he would resign over, if there was any principle that would be so important to him, he said, “I’m a bit of an optimist, so it doesn’t tend to occur to me to resign. I tend to think of a way of Sellotaping everything together and quietly finding a way through if I can.” In other words, he would sort of do what it took to kind of paper over the edges in order to get through it in order to remain in office. michael barbaro Which is another way of saying, when it comes to his convictions, they are malleable. sarah lyall Yes. And that’s illustrated again when he runs for mayor in 2008, because he refashions himself then. He positions himself as a liberal, urbane man of multicultural London. He’s pro-business, but he’s pro-immigrants. archived recording (boris johnson) If you’ve been here for more than 10 to 12 years, I’m afraid the authorities no longer really pursue you. They give up. archived recording So should we have that amnesty? archived recording (boris johnson) Well, why not be honest about what is going on? archived recording So have that amnesty? archived recording (boris johnson) Yeah, absolutely. sarah lyall Like, he’s this really old-fashioned conservative, who went to Oxford, speaks in a really posh accent, which isn’t supposed to go over well with regular people. And regular people love him. He would walk through the streets of London and people would sort of yell, hey, Boris. Women found him really attractive. archived recording Boris says what he means, and he delivers. sarah lyall There’s just something about him that made him a really good candidate. So then he gets elected mayor, which was actually an amazing feat. A conservative would never get elected in London, and it was based purely on personal popularity. archived recording (boris johnson) I do not, for one minute, believe that this election shows that London has been transformed overnight into a conservative city. [music] sarah lyall And then he continued with these sort of funny statements. And he also showed to the world a kind of physical comedy. archived recording He got himself into pretty deep water today. sarah lyall So he once was at the Thames doing something, and he fell into the river. archived recording (speaker 1) Oh, then really badly. archived recording (speaker 2) And this is the best bit. This is the best bit here. She pulls down the volunteer with him. sarah lyall And then what a lot of people saw was, during the 2012 Olympics, he was trying to promote Britain or promote London or something, and he went down this zip wire. And he got stuck in a zip wire, and he had this sort of wedgie. And he was stuck in the middle. archived recording (speaker 1) Hey, Boris, you’re going the wrong way. archived recording (speaker 2) This way. archived recording (speaker 1) Boris, this way. sarah lyall He looked so ridiculous. Look at his little blue hat. He’s wearing the most ill-fitting outfit. Oop, it just stopped. And he’s dangling. archived recording (boris johnson) It’s going well. It’s very, very well-organized. What they do — get me a ladder. michael barbaro He’s really kind of hamming it up. sarah lyall Yes, he is. michael barbaro And the crowd beneath him, it seems kind of charmed. sarah lyall Look at them all taking pictures of him, laughing. He makes people feel good. He really does. archived recording (boris johnson) Can you get me a rope? [LAUGHTER] Get me a rope, O.K.? sarah lyall Any other politician, that would have been the end, to be photographed like that. But he turned it into a plus. He turned it into a virtue, and people thought it was hilarious. And they thought he was cuddly and cute. The thing about when he was mayor is the first time he had that much power, and he was fantastic figurehead. He was a fantastic front man. archived recording (boris johnson) Finally, you have brought home a great truth about our country, that when we put our mind to it, there is absolutely nothing that this country cannot achieve. sarah lyall He was not a details person. He showed up late to things. He was ill-prepared. He wouldn’t read anything. He didn’t know about the policies. And luckily, the mayor of London isn’t that important a job, really. He doesn’t have a lot of responsibility, so he couldn’t really mess it up. But he was not a great mayor. michael barbaro So Boris Johnson has been a consistent source of amusement and controversy. sarah lyall Boris is constantly getting himself into trouble and constantly finding a way out of it through basically charm and bluster and an ability to talk himself out of any situation. michael barbaro And what trouble does he get himself out of? sarah lyall Well, there’s been a lot of trouble with women. He fathered a child with someone other than his wife while he was mayor of London and managed to never really have to discuss it publicly. When he was editor of The Spectator, he had an affair with one of his employees, who got pregnant, wrote about it. He denied in the beginning he’d had the affair. He lied to the journalists who asked. He lied to the prime minister. He got fired from his job. And somehow he got out of that, too. And it started to become clear that his disheveled, bumbling persona was calculated. And people have said — and I’ve seen it, too — before he goes on TV, he’ll run his hands through his hair to make it look messier, as if he couldn’t be bothered to ever brush it. He wants to look like that. And someone recently told this amazing story about how Boris came to speak at some kind of civic meeting, or a meeting of some industry group, and arrived five minutes late, right before he was supposed to speak. And sort of got up and looked and said, where am I speaking, what group is this, and told these anecdotes, and how he totally snowed the crowd. The crowd thought it was hilarious. They loved him. And the guy was really happy he pulled it off. Until he saw Boris do the exact same thing at a totally different group some months later, the exact same thing. He came late. He said, where am I? He told the same anecdotes, as if it was just off the top of his head. michael barbaro And in fact, it was a routine. sarah lyall It was a routine. It was a comedy routine designed to promote this view of him as this disheveled, bumbling person who could sort of pull it out at the last minute. He wants to seem that way. michael barbaro So a lot of this is an act. It’s kind of political theater. sarah lyall Exactly. And during that whole time, when people asked him, did he want to be prime minister, what was he going to do next? He would always slough it off with what looked like more of an act. archived recording Is there a possibility you could become prime minister? archived recording (boris johnson) I think that that is vanishing. I’ve about as much chance of being reincarnated as an olive. [LAUGHTER] [music] sarah lyall And so meanwhile, though, he is quietly consolidating his popularity and preparing in his head somehow a way to challenge the prime minister, David Cameron. He’s way more popular than David Cameron, though he’s just an M.P. at this point. And the question is, how would he get there? What would he do? And then finally, in 2016, he sees a chance. michael barbaro And what is that chance? sarah lyall The chance is Brexit. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. So Sarah, pick us up where we left off. It’s 2016, and you said that Boris Johnson sees his chance to become prime minister. What’s happening at that moment? archived recording (david cameron) We are approaching one of the biggest decisions this country will face in our lifetimes, whether to remain in a reformed European Union or to leave. sarah lyall So it was then that the prime minister, David Cameron, called the referendum known as Brexit over whether Britain would leave the European Union. archived recording (david cameron) The choice goes to the heart of the kind of country we want to be and the future that we want for our children. sarah lyall He and his government were pro-Remain. archived recording (david cameron) My recommendation is clear. I believe that Britain will be safer, stronger and better off in a reformed European Union. sarah lyall And everyone assumed that the country felt the same way. And he assumes that all his allies in the Conservative Party will follow along with him — michael barbaro Including Johnson. sarah lyall — including Johnson, to campaign to remain. So Johnson was one of the people who was supposed to support him. And at the very last minute — archived recording (boris johnson) We have a chance, actually, to do something. I have a chance, actually, to do something. sarah lyall Boris became head of the Leave campaign. archived recording (boris johnson) I would like to see a new relationship, based more on trade, on cooperation, but as I say, with much less of this supranational element. So that’s where I’m coming from. archived recording Boris, if that’s really what you’ve thought all along, why have you kept your party waiting for such a long time? archived recording (boris johnson) The truth is that it has been agonizingly difficult. michael barbaro Is it clear at this moment whether Boris Johnson actually wants to leave the E.U.? sarah lyall Well, he wrote a famous editorial on the day he made this announcement of how he felt about it, saying, we should leave the E.U. Britain should leave the E.U. But it turned out later he had written an opposing editorial saying the exact opposite thing. It was only at the last minute that he decided to run with the “we should leave” version. michael barbaro Suggesting that the depth of his conviction here might have been shallow. sarah lyall Suggesting there was no depth of his conviction at all, that it was just political calculation and pragmatism. What would be better for Boris? michael barbaro Better for Boris how? sarah lyall Better for Boris in that he wanted power. And what he thought would happen, what everyone thought would happen, was the following — that Brexit would be voted down, that they’d remain in the European Union, but that David Cameron would be so weakened by the whole process that he would have to step down as prime minister, leaving Boris in place to take over. And then Boris would lead the country, not through Brexit — because Brexit would have been voted down — but he would have appeased the right wing of the party, and thus consolidated his power better than Cameron ever could. michael barbaro So this whole kind of move to backstab David Cameron by supporting Brexit at the last minute is based on his belief that Brexit would not actually happen, until it did. archived recording There we are. That is now statistically, mathematically there, that the Leave campaign have won. And we’re expecting at the end of the count 52 percent for Leave, 48 percent for Remain. Quite an extraordinary moment. sarah lyall Everybody was shocked. And if you see, there was an amazing moment where Boris Johnson comes out — archived recording (boris johnson) Today, I think all of us politicians — sarah lyall — the head of this campaign — archived recording (boris johnson) — should thank the British people — sarah lyall — to give a press conference — archived recording (boris johnson) — because, in a way, they have been doing our job for us. sarah lyall — to basically reassure the country that he is in control, that he knows what he’s doing. archived recording (boris johnson) They hire us to deal with the hard questions. And this year, we gave them one of the biggest and toughest questions of all. sarah lyall And he looks so frightened. archived recording (boris johnson) I believe the British people have spoken up for democracy. sarah lyall He looks like a deer caught in the headlights. He has no plan. It becomes clear he has no plan. ^archived recording (boris johnson) Thank you, finally, to everybody at Vote Leave for the extraordinary and positive campaign you have run. Thank you. michael barbaro Then what happens? archived recording (david cameron) It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our country as prime minister over these last six years. sarah lyall So then David Cameron quits. And they’re left with a power vacuum. Who is going to be the next prime minister? And at that point, it looked like Boris was a shoo-in. He was definitely going to get it. He had been the head of the Leave campaign. He was the most popular politician in the country. michael barbaro And this is what he’s always wanted. sarah lyall Yeah, everybody knew who he was. It’s what he’s always wanted. And he had a colleague, Michael Gove, who had also betrayed Cameron and helped him, helped Boris, with the anti-Europe campaign. And the idea was that Boris would be prime minister, and Michael Gove would be, like, chancellor of the Exchequer or some other really good job. And they’d sort of planned it all out. And there really weren’t any other legitimate candidates at that point. So that was, like, on a Friday, I think. And there was, I think, six days to figure this out, or about a week to figure it out. And they’re campaigning, and everyone’s like, what are they going to do? They have to put out some sort of plan. Boris writes this editorial for The Telegraph that’s supposedly putting out his political plan. There isn’t really a plan. It’s all chaotic. It’s all weird. Everyone’s getting scared. And then the day before Boris is meant to formally announce that he is putting his name forward to be prime minister — archived recording (michael gove) I thought it was right that, following the decision that the British people took last week — sarah lyall — Michael Gove, his great friend and ally through the whole campaign — archived recording (michael gove) And I hoped that Boris Johnson would be someone who could ensure that the government followed the instructions of the British people, and also build and unite a team around him in order to lead this country forward. sarah lyall — calls a press conference and says — archived recording (michael gove) And Boris is an amazing and an impressive person. But I’ve realized in the last few days that Boris isn’t capable of building that team and providing that unity. sarah lyall He doesn’t trust Boris. He thinks Boris would be a bad prime minister. michael barbaro Good lord. sarah lyall He’s withdrawing his support. Yes. And so — ^archived recording (boris johnson) Well, I must tell you — sarah lyall Everybody who thought Boris is going to be prime minister is now saying he’s not going to be. And Boris has to withdraw from the race. ^archived recording (boris johnson) I have concluded that person cannot be me. michael barbaro This is pretty humiliating. sarah lyall Really humiliating, and it felt like everything had finally caught up to him. He’d been exposed. The lying, the blundering, the sort of lack of preparation, the inability to follow through on things had all finally, finally come back to haunt him. He’d always gotten away with everything before. He was like the Teflon politician. And suddenly, he was having to accept the repercussions of what he had done. michael barbaro What happens? sarah lyall They have to find a compromise candidate. And everyone is sort of poisoned in one way or another, so they settle on this super unlikely figure, Theresa May. archived recording (theresa may) I have just been to Buckingham Palace, where Her Majesty the Queen has asked me to form a new government. And I accepted. sarah lyall And she tries, and she tries, and no one likes what she does. michael barbaro And where is Boris during all this period? sarah lyall Well, Boris is a dangerous figure. So she felt, the way Cameron did before, that she could sort of neuter him by giving him a job in her cabinet. So she makes him foreign secretary, another job he’s not very good at. archived recording Either they’re dissembling or lying, or you are. Four ambassadors said they heard it said several times. You said it’s not government policy, but you do support free movement. That’s four of them. They’re not lying. ^archived recording (boris johnson) No, that’s complete nonsense. Yes. Well, I think that they have been misrepresented. And if I may say so, I’m not entirely convinced that your reporter talked to those ambassadors. And I think — sarah lyall He’s underprepared. He’s disheveled. He says things that aren’t true. He makes some bad blunders, but he sort of soldiers on. michael barbaro Sounds like Boris Johnson. sarah lyall Sounds like Boris Johnson. He’s Boris being Boris. And then he ends up resigning from the cabinet over what he says is Theresa May’s poor handling of the Brexit negotiations. ^archived recording (boris johnson) We never actually turned that vision into a negotiating position in Brussels. And we never made it into a negotiating offer. Instead, we dithered. sarah lyall But really what he’s doing is starting to plot his next move. [music] archived recording So the nos have it. The nos have it. Unlock! Indeed, point of order, the prime minister. ^archived recording (boris johnson) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the House has spoken, and the government will listen. It is clear that the House does not support this deal. But tonight’s vote tells us nothing about what it does support. sarah lyall Theresa May is like one of those — she’s, I’m afraid, like a bull in a bull ring, who has tons of stuff sticking out of her. And she’s staggering around, and people are throwing spears at her. And they’re sticking in, and she’s bleeding, and everyone’s criticizing her. michael barbaro This is so graphic. sarah lyall Sorry. And she keeps coming back. archived recording So the nos have it. The nos have it. Unlock! sarah lyall And trying again, and nobody likes anything she does. archived recording (theresa may) On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, I profoundly regret the decision that this House has taken tonight. sarah lyall And she becomes more and more unpopular. archived recording So the nos have it. The nos have it. Unlock! sarah lyall And by the end, people are almost like, whoever gets in we prefer to Theresa May. archived recording (theresa may) Mr. Speaker, I think it should be a matter of profound regret to every member of this House that once again, we have been unable to support leaving the European Union — [SHOUTING] — in orderly fashion. archived recording Order. sarah lyall So the moment that Theresa May announces that she’s stepping down, Boris Johnson sees his second chance. michael barbaro To be prime minister. sarah lyall To be prime minister. Get her out, and then he can go in. archived recording I am pleased today, I am proud today, to introduce the candidate whom I shall support to lead the Conservative Party and our nation, a man who has already shown that he can lead this great global city through two successful terms. Ladies and gentlemen, Boris Johnson. [APPLAUSE] michael barbaro Sarah, are we to understand that all of this played out exactly the way that Boris Johnson would have hoped, that after he elevated Brexit, no matter what you think of it, Brexit has come around to elevate him? sarah lyall I think that’s right. I think in the last three years since the vote, he’s had to get his head around the fact, this is what’s going to happen. And if he has a conviction, this is now his conviction. And it’s a poisoned chalice, in my opinion. I feel like he’s set himself up for a task that’s almost impossible to carry out. And it’s kind of ironic that he’s gotten this job through something that he put into place and made it so difficult for himself. His political hero is Winston Churchill. He always wanted to be Winston Churchill. And I don’t see how anyone could be Winston Churchill throughout the Brexit process. michael barbaro Why not? sarah lyall It’s not like defeating the Nazis during the Second World War. It’s not a war. It’s a very, very complicated divorce from an entity that Britain is incredibly connected to in ways that most people don’t understand and take for granted. And I don’t see anyone coming out of it better off than they were before. michael barbaro So now this man, with what appears to be no deeply rooted political views, is going to be steering the U.K. through its greatest political challenge, perhaps, in history. And it’s exactly what he wanted. sarah lyall I’m not sure he wanted to have to be prime minister at this moment in history. But it’s the only chance he’s going to get. And he has a sort of blind optimism that he will be able to figure something out when he gets a job. And I think that’s the approach he’s taking now. [music] michael barbaro Sarah, thank you very much. sarah lyall Thank you. michael barbaro And good luck in London. sarah lyall Thank you. Yeah, I’m flying there soon. michael barbaro So you’re going to be there for the election. sarah lyall I’ll be there again, yeah. And I’ll do what I thought I was supposed to do two years ago, the last time this came around, three years ago. michael barbaro Which is? sarah lyall I will write this story saying that Boris Johnson has become prime minister. That was supposed to happen before, and maybe it will happen this time. michael barbaro
0~Relaxing, Weird, Beautiful: Riding the Bus on the New 14th Street~One such slowpoke route is the M42, along 42nd Street, which cuts across Times Square, where the traffic continues to move along at a tortoise-like pace. For comparison purposes, I took a couple of trips on buses on both streets. On 14th Street, aboard the M14, I remembered a childhood book about a magic bus with a button on the dashboard. When someone pushed the button — abracadabra — the bus went from Boston to New York, just like that. The M14 isn’t that fast. But it was more than twice as fast as the M42 on the rides I took. And on one standing-room-only trip late in the afternoon, I wondered if I would need a crash helmet. I was in the middle of the bus interviewing high school volleyball players on the way to — I think they said a match on the Lower East Side. I swayed as the bus went into a turn onto Avenue C. Whatever I scribbled in my notebook was illegible. That was a couple of blocks beyond the car-free zone, which runs from Ninth Avenue to Third Avenue. But the most startling thing was not just the ride but the views along the street. Sitting in a westbound bus, I could see all the way from First Avenue to Third Avenue — two long Manhattan blocks with no traffic in sight, just some police cars and a few trucks parked at the curb.
0~Apple Wins Ruling in New York iPhone Hacking Order~A federal magistrate judge on Monday denied the United States government’s request that Apple extract data from an iPhone in a drug case in New York, giving the company’s pro-privacy stance a boost as it battles law enforcement officials over opening up the device in other cases. The ruling, from Judge James Orenstein in New York’s Eastern District, is the first time that the government’s legal argument for opening up devices like the iPhone has been put to the test. The denial could influence other cases where law enforcement officials are trying to compel Apple to help unlock iPhones, including the standoff between Apple and the F.B.I. over the iPhone used by one of the attackers in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., last year. Judge Orenstein, in his 50-page ruling on Monday, took particular aim at a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act that underlies many government requests for extracting data from tech companies. The All Writs Act broadly says that courts can require actions to comply with their orders when not covered by existing law. Judge Orenstein said the government was inflating its authority by using the All Writs Act to force Apple to extract data from an iPhone seized in connection with a drug case. The government’s view of the All Writs Act is so expansive as to cast doubt on its constitutionality if adopted, Judge Orenstein wrote.
0~Saad Hariri, Lebanon's Ex-Prime Minister, Could Again Lead the Country~BEIRUT, Lebanon — Despite a public outcry for change, Lebanon’s president has tapped Saad Hariri, the embattled former prime minister who stepped down late last year amid antigovernment protests, to again try to form a government. Mr. Hariri, who left office amid multiple crises as the country teetered on economic collapse, received the mandate after garnering enough support from Parliament on Thursday. President Michel Aoun asked Mr. Hariri to try to cobble together a governing coalition, the office of the presidency said. There is no guarantee he will succeed. Lebanon remains mired in crisis, its economy in shambles, as the country also struggles with the fallout from an Aug. 4 explosion in the port of Beirut that killed nearly 200 people, caused billions of dollars in damage and devastated entire neighborhoods of the city. Mr. Hariri vowed to form a cabinet of experts and technocrats “away from political parties” that will be committed to financial and economic overhauls to make the country viable again and to rebuild after the damage of the blast.
0~Sessions Is Said to Have Offered to Resign~WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions offered to resign in recent weeks as he told President Trump he needed the freedom to do his job, according to two people who were briefed on the discussion. The president turned down the offer, but on Tuesday, the White House declined to say whether Mr. Trump still had confidence in his attorney general. “I have not had that discussion with him,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters, responding to questions about whether the president had soured on Mr. Sessions. Mr. Spicer’s remarks came after The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had vented intermittently about Mr. Sessions since the attorney general recused himself from any Russia-related investigations conducted by the Justice Department. Mr. Trump has fumed to allies and advisers ever since, suggesting that Mr. Sessions’s decision was needless.
0~With an Assist From Craigslist, a Sex Worker Plies His Trade~James sat at the Sweet Inspiration cafe on Market Street in San Francisco, sipped ginger ginseng tea and talked about his job. He was once a barista in a place like this, but today he works in the oldest profession. “I think I’m doing something more important for people than making another latte,” he said. Tall, taut, with bleached blond hair, James, 25, asked to only be identified by his first name only for fear of legal reprisals, but spoke candidly about his life as a sex worker, offering a rare glimpse into a local subculture that has become the subject of much debate: sex workers, including James, who say they have freely chosen this vocation. James said he was self-employed — no one manages his affairs, hires him out or takes a cut of his earnings. “I run myself — that’s why I do what I do,” he said. For a $100 fee, he provides “healing erotic touch.” He finds most customers on Craigslist, the online classified service. “It’s how I support myself,” he said.
0~He Threatened Pelosi. Agents Didn’t Wait to See if He Really Meant It.~Last year, federal prosecutors around the country brought only 30 cases characterized as “domestic terrorism” that led with the charge of transmitting a threat, according to an analysis by a Syracuse University research group. Still, that number was the highest since at least 2000. “Historically, these kinds of cases are not high on prosecutors’ priority lists,” said Daniel Silver, a former federal prosecutor in New York who supervised terrorism cases. “You really have to show the person intended to cause imminent violence as opposed to just expressing their opinion.” Instead, prosecutors sometimes turn to other charges that are easier to prove against someone who is posting violent threats. For instance, Eduard Florea, a software engineer in Queens, alarmed law enforcement officials with death threats that they said he had posted on Parler against Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia around the day of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6. He wrote in obscenity-laden posts that Mr. Warnock would have a hard time casting votes “when he’s swinging with the fish,” and that “dead men can’t pass laws,” prosecutors said. On the afternoon of the riot, he said he was armed and ready, writing, “Kill them all,” according to the complaint. What we consider before using anonymous sources.

But Mr. Florea was not initially charged with transmitting a threat. He was hit with a weapons charge after agents searched his home and said they found ammunition, which he was not allowed to possess because he has a felony criminal record. He told the agents that he had applied to join the Proud Boys, according to prosecutors, and traveled with them last year to vandalize a church in Washington. His lawyer, Mia Eisner-Grynberg, declined to comment. At his bail hearing, she said he did not condone violence, arguing that the “rhetoric was extremely high on all sides” during the riot. When law enforcement officials are concerned about a violent social media threat that has not led to any real-world action, that person will often get a knock on the door from the F.B.I. with a warning.
0~How Roe’s Demise Could Safeguard Gay Marriage~This transcript was created using speech recognition software. While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions. michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, Democrats introduced a bill to try to prevent gay marriage from meeting the same fate as abortion. It was expected to go nowhere, but over the past few days, the bill has won more and more Republican support, and improbably could now become law. My colleague, Annie Karni, with the story of how that happened. It’s Tuesday, July 26. Annie, what’s the story behind this same sex marriage bill? What exactly are its origins? annie karni So this all started after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. archived recording No one can say they didn’t know this was coming. Now the question is, for the Democrats, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do next? annie karni There was tremendous frustration among progressives and Democrats at the decision. archived recording So I received a text message from Joe Biden’s campaign yesterday, saying that the Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade, and that it was my responsibility to then rush $15 to the Democratic national party. annie karni But also at the response from Democrats — archived recording They have had multiple opportunities to codify Roe into law over the past — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s first reaction was not a detailed plan to respond to something we knew it was coming. It was to read a poem. annie karni Everyone had been expecting this ruling for weeks, and there seemed to be very little response plan. archived recording Yes, the Republicans are dangerous, and my party needs to act like it. It’s just like having some firefighters come to your house, and they got all the equipment, and the fire chief says, you know what? We can’t come in yet, because we’ve got to wait for a few more firefighters, even though they have all the tools at their disposal to put out the fire. annie karni So in this moment, they are looking for ways to show they’re still working, to show they’re trying to protect rights, to paint Republicans as the party of extremists. And at the same time, one new piece of information that came out when the Supreme Court issued their ruling was this opinion by Justice Thomas, where he kind of laid out a roadmap of what this conservative leaning court wants to do. And he said that the next targets that they would like to look at are same sex marriage and the right to contraception, that these things could also be revisited. So suddenly, Democrats, who are under a lot of pressure from their base to look like they’re not behind the ball, but they’re ahead of the ball, have two items on the agenda that they can respond to ahead of time, rather than responding to after it’s already too late. michael barbaro Right, same sex marriage and contraception. annie karni Right, so based on the roadmap that Thomas lays out in his opinion on Roe, Democrats introduced two bills. One would safeguard contraception, and the other would safeguard same sex marriage. And Democrats know that passing either of these bills would be an uphill battle, but they also think there’s no downside to bringing them up for a vote. First of all, they have to show their base that they are trying to do anything. This is an election year, and having a floor vote, even if it’s just a show vote, gives Democrats a chance to draw this stark contrast with Republicans on these social issues. So even if the bills fail, Democrats have put Republicans on the record, and they can campaign on that. And if these bills somehow pass, then Democrats have done something that’s rarer and rarer these days, which is gotten something major passed in this Congress that they can send Biden to sign. And he can claim it as a win, which he is also desperate for. So last week, Democrats moved on both these issues, on the contraception bill and on the same sex marriage bill. And the contraception bill, as Democrats expected, drew very little support from Republicans. It passed basically along party lines in the House. There’s no discussion right now of having a Senate vote on it, or moving it along. This basically amounts to a House show vote that is dead on arrival and not moving forward down the process. michael barbaro Got it, and what about the same sex marriage bill? annie karni Same sex marriage had a bit of a different path. This bill is called the Respect for Marriage Act and basically, it’s designed to solidify a protection that exists for now, which is the right for same sex couples to be married, regardless of what state they live in. This has been protected by the Constitution since 2015, when the Supreme Court established a federal protection of gay marriage under the 14th Amendment. This bill would not completely codify the rights that were laid out in that landmark ruling, but it’s a first step. michael barbaro Mm-hmm. annie karni The bill also protects interracial marriages, but this has really been discussed as the same sex marriage bill. michael barbaro So what happens to this bill? annie karni So the night before they brought that bill to the floor, word started going around that House Republican leadership was not planning to whip no votes on the bill. michael barbaro Just explain that. annie karni Usually, the whip, which is Representative Scalise, will send out a note to all House Republicans telling them which way to vote on a bill. It’s the leadership position. And sometimes, Kevin McCarthy, the Minority Leader, will be on the floor working votes, telling people to vote no. There was no effort on this bill to get anyone to vote in a certain direction, or to vote as a bloc. What I was told was that they recognized that several Republicans were going to be for it. And they just didn’t want to expend the energy on something that they weren’t going to completely oppose. And it was going to pass anyway, so they didn’t whip on it. archived recording Can I start — for what purpose does the gentleman from New York, Mr. Nadler, seek recognition? annie karni So the next day — archived recording I call up HR 8404, the Respect for Marriage Act, and that’s for its immediate consideration in the House. annie karni The bill comes to the floor for a vote. archived recording (nancy pelosi) Mr. Chairman, we’re here because just three weeks ago, the Republican controlled Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, ripped away a woman’s freedom over her most intimate health decisions. annie karni We are watching some floor speeches. archived recording (nancy pelosi) These radical justices took a wrecking ball to precedent of the court and privacy in the Constitution. annie karni Democrats talking about the need to protect the nation and basic rights from extremist lawmakers and extremist Supreme Court. archived recording We thought the Democrats were obsessed with President Trump, but Justice Thomas is a close second. This bill is simply the latest installment of the Democrats’ campaign to delegitimize and attempt to intimidate the United States Supreme Court. We can have a very robust debate here in this body if we ever actually debated on the floor of the people’s house, but we don’t. annie karni Some Republicans talking about how they’re going to oppose this because they didn’t have a chance to read the bill — archived recording Now, my colleagues on other side of the aisle want to put forward a bill that is clearly political in nature because they don’t want to talk about inflation. They don’t want to talk about wide open borders. They don’t want to talk about rampant crime. annie karni Other reasons — so it’s not really clear how much support it will get. archived recording The question is on the passage of the bill. This is a five minute vote. annie karni When the vote begins, it goes fairly quickly. archived recording 1 — from the House, that Mr. Garcia will vote Yes on HR 8404. archived recording 2 I informed the House that both Mr. Smucker and Mr. Reschenthaler vote no on HR 8404. annie karni The Democrats control the House, so everyone expects the vote to pass. The question is, will it be just another show vote? archived recording 1 — from the House, Mr. Rice will vote Yea on HR 8404. archived recording 2 Nay on HR 8404. archived recording 3 Yes on HR 8404. archived recording 4 No on HR 8404. archived recording 5 Yes on HR 8404. annie karni And we see a number in the Republican column. It’s going up to double digits, and it goes ultimately to 47 Republicans voting Yes on a bill to protect same sex marriage. archived recording Yeas are 267, and the Nays are 157. The bill is passed. [music] annie karni 47 was a bigger number than a lot of people were expecting. A lot of Democrats watching were surprised. And we see some unusual names who ended up voting Yes. michael barbaro Like who? annie karni Liz Cheney voted Yes. She, for a long time, was opposed to gay marriage, even though it put her in direct conflict with her father and with her sister, who is gay and married. She voted for it. We saw Scott Perry, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus, vote for it. And then we saw split leadership. We saw Kevin McCarthy and Scalise, the top two Republicans, opposed. And we saw the number three House Republican, Elise Stefanik, who’s a MAGA warrior, vote for it. So we really saw this issue get a bigger number of Republicans than expected to, and divide the conference in very surprising ways. michael barbaro So Annie, how do you explain that level of Republican support, especially from members of Congress that we think of as pretty conservative — your Perrys and your Stefaniks. Why is there so much more support for gay marriage than, for example, the contraception bill? How do you understand that? annie karni I think there’s a few different things going on here. The biggest answer to the question is that same sex marriage is so broadly popular, there’s such a generational divide here, that being opposed to marriage equality is basically writing off a generation of voters who at this point believe this is how the world should work. So anyone who’s interested in this vote breakdown and why it divided Republicans the way it did should look up those 47 Republicans who voted Yes, and look at how many of them are up for reelection, how many of them actually have a competitive race on their hands. Because if you’re up right now and you’re running, being opposed to gay marriage, especially if you’re trying to win over suburban, moderate voters is incredibly difficult. Also, a point that some Democrats made to me is that being opposed to abortion in some of those districts is difficult, because there’s broad support for some abortion access. So given that they’re already opposed to abortion, they don’t necessarily feel like they can be opposed to every one of these rights and not alienate a lot of key voters, especially younger voters. The generational thing is key. Another thing is just the personal connection to this, which is why the gay rights movement and the movement for gay marriage has been so quickly successful. People have personal connections. We’ve seen people in elected office change their positions because a son or a daughter comes out to them, and it changes their whole view of the issue. michael barbaro So just to summarize this, the reason why so many House Republicans voted for same sex marriage, and seem to be treating this bill differently than the other bills that Democrats have put forth since Roe v. Wade was revoked is political and personal. annie karni Political and personal, yes, and I would add one more thing, which is that this bill was really simple. It was four pages. So that’s the third reason — personal, political, and simple. michael barbaro So Annie, what’s the reaction among Democrats after this vote? Were they as surprised as it seems the public was? annie karni They were really encouraged and impressed by the 47. It was higher than what they had been expecting. And before the House took that vote, Schumer, who’s the Majority Leader in the Senate and decides what bills come to the floor and get voted on, had been wishy-washy about whether he was ever going to bring this bill to a vote in the Senate. He was not talking about it as a legislative priority to get finished before the August recess. But after the vote — chuck schumer Mr. President — annie karni The next day, he gets on the floor — chuck schumer Before I begin, I want to say something about the House-passed Respect for Marriage Act. annie karni And he says this legislation is so important — chuck schumer I want to bring this bill to the floor. annie karni We’re going to take a vote on it, and we’re going to try and get 10 Republicans on board to actually get it passed. chuck schumer I spoke to Senator Baldwin, who is one of the leaders of this legislation, in the Senate this morning. And she is talking to Republicans to see where the support is. annie karni And he puts a Senator, Senator Tammy Baldwin, who was the first gay elected Senator when she was elected 10 years ago — puts her in charge of finding Republican support in the Senate to back the bill. chuck schumer And we’re working to get the necessary Senate Republican support to ensure it will pass. annie karni So suddenly, this bill that looked like it was just a part of this broad effort of Democrats to show that they’re fighting to draw a contrast with Republicans in election year — suddenly, this bill looks like there’s actually a narrow path where it could actually pass and become law, not just a messaging vote. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. So Annie, what are this bill’s chances in the Senate. Schumer is talking about it as if it has a real shot. Is that realistic? annie karni It’s looking like there is a narrow path where it could actually pass. Everything is harder in the Senate. The Democrats in the Senate have a 50-50 majority. To pass a bill, you need 60 votes to move past a filibuster. So for every piece of legislation that Democrats want to pass, they need 10 Republicans. And it looked like there were four, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio — these are, like, the classic moderates that Democrats can get on board. Thom Tillis of North Carolina was also part of that first four. And the question is, where are the next six? Then last week, a more surprising name said that he would vote for a bill to codify same sex marriage, and that’s Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, a real conservative, but he’s in a very tough reelection battle in his state right now. michael barbaro So that confirms your earlier theory that when it comes to reelections, Republicans — annie karni Yes, if you have a tough race on your hands, being opposed to same sex marriage is a tough position to have. michael barbaro Why is it not perhaps even easier for Democrats in the Senate, and even in the House — we tend to think of the Senate as a place where there’s more moderation than in the House, and 47 House Republicans voted for this bill. What is the argument against this bill among Senate Republicans who aren’t on board? annie karni The argument against the bill was, why do we have to talk about this right now? This is a right that is protected by the Constitution. We heard Senator Romney say that. Like, I don’t see a need to talk about this. Basically, it was like, the house isn’t burning right now. We’ll deal with that if it’s burning. Marco Rubio dismissed it as a stupid waste of time. You know, Republicans don’t want to talk about this because they want to talk about gas prices, inflation. And we saw Rubio say that. He said, I know a lot of gay people in Florida, and they’re mad about gas. So they’re trying to claim that this whole conversation is a political ploy by Democrats to distract from Biden’s failures. michael barbaro But just to speak to the point about the, House isn’t on fire, what do these Senate Republicans say to the fact that Justice Thomas wrote what he wrote, which was that gay marriage and contraceptions might be the next thing to be revoked by this Supreme Court, and what do they say to the reality that Roe didn’t seem like it was under threat, until suddenly, it was gone. annie karni I think they benefit from the fact that hallway interviews are very short, and there’s not a real opportunity for a follow up and a discussion where you point out the flaw in their argument. It’s kind of like you give your soundbite, and then you’re walking away, and that’s the conversation. So they haven’t really had to be pressed like that yet. michael barbaro Got it. So at this point, there are five Republican Senators who have said they will support this gay marriage bill, and 45 others, it sounds like, who want to tell reporters like you to go away and stop asking them about it in the hallway. What is the plan by Democrats, by Senator Tammy Baldwin — who’s overseeing this — to try to get five more, perhaps many more than five. annie karni So she’s doing personal outreach. She has a list of about 10 that she’s targeting. They won’t give us the exact list, because they want to keep all these conversations private. They don’t want anyone to run away from them, because it gets public. But she was texting with them over the weekend. One thing I was told is that she was making a lot of assurances about the simplicity of the bill, like we were talking about before. This is really all it does. It’s not complicated. There’s not loopholes and other things attached in here that you won’t like, and just underscoring to them that this is really straightforward. michael barbaro Annie, during the House vote, you said that Republican leaders refrained from telling their members how to vote, which seemed like a very powerful permission structure that resulted in 47 of them backing the bill. What are Senate Republican leaders telling their members? annie karni So far, kind of the same strategy. Mitch McConnell has not tipped his hand about which way he’s going to be voting. He was asked about it last week. And he said, I’ll wait till Schumer brings up a bill to the floor to weigh in here. It’s kind of a kick the can down the road strategy. michael barbaro This is not a reticent Senator, McConnell, when he wants to make a — annie karni He’s not a reticent senator, but he’s also a senator who really has been explicit with reporters about the need for Republicans to appeal to suburban, moderate voters. So he’s made that case on other issues. I asked for an update today, and they said no update on where he stands on the bill. He’s waiting quietly to see, I think, how much support ends up coming out. michael barbaro So Annie, given the current situation, what do the Democrats and the leaders that you talk to say is the likelihood that this bill is going to pass? You use that phrase narrow path. Just how narrow is it at this point? annie karni I mean, I don’t — I want to give myself an out in case it all falls apart, so it’s narrow, but they are confident. They are talking in terms of getting 10 or more. They’re not there yet, but what I’m being told is that by Wednesday, they could be confident that they have 10 ready to go. michael barbaro Wow. annie karni Which would mean they could take a cloture vote on Thursday, which is a procedural vote before the vote. That would be very ambitious. There’s other factors here. Senator Manchin is out with Covid. In a 50/50 Senate, every time one person is out, you can’t take a big vote. You need every vote. michael barbaro Right. annie karni So there’s other factors at play that mean that the idea that they’re going to pass this this week is unlikely. But the people I’m talking to seem confident that they could have their list of 10 that they feel confident about. michael barbaro Got it. So accepting that this is not yet a done deal, that it could still fall apart, let’s talk about what it would mean if this bill, somewhat improbably, actually becomes law — starting with what it will mean for the gay community. annie karni If this passes, it’s a very big deal. It might not seem so on the face of it, because really, it’s reinforcing a right that currently exists. So you wouldn’t see gay people running to get married after this passes — michael barbaro Because they already have that right — right. annie karni They have that right right now. But instead of being entirely reliant on the Supreme Court ruling to create that right to get married on a federal level, if this passes, Congress is showing that it is committed to creating some protections for gay marriage through law. And that’s a big deal, especially at a time when other rights for the gay community are under assault at the state level. michael barbaro And in the end, for everyone on the left, especially women, I have to imagine this is a complicated moment. They may celebrate the fact that gay marriage is about to be enshrined in federal law. They might see it as a victory. But then there’s the reality that it must be strange for someone who cares about the right to an abortion to see that the end of Roe v. Wade has fueled an effort to safeguard an entirely different right, which is gay marriage, rather than fuel the fight to safeguard abortion or the issues related to it, like contraception, which as you’ve just told us, has failed to really go anywhere. annie karni I think that’s right. If this passes, it is a complicated moment for many women who are seeing the enshrinement of a federal law that will protect a right, but it’s only happening as a reaction to this post Roe universe that is now the dark reality for many Democrats. But same sex marriage and abortion remain very, very different issues. Same sex marriage over the past decade has skyrocketed to national acceptance. You see it among voters. You see it among the Republican support in Congress, where they can’t oppose it. And abortion still, to this day, remains a much more polarizing issue, maybe the most polarizing social issue in our country. And it just still is. And the reality is that Congress has tried and failed to pass a bill that would give legal protections to abortion, and it has never worked. So at the end of the day, it’s a bittersweet moment, I think, for women who see a group gaining a right in the wake of a very big loss. michael barbaro Annie, thank you very much. We appreciate it. annie karni Thank you. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. archived recording (pope francis) [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael barbaro On Monday, Pope Francis offered a sweeping apology for the Catholic Church’s conduct in Canada, where for decades it operated residential schools for Indigenous people that inflicted physical, sexual and mental abuse, erased languages, and used Christianity as a weapon to break native culture. archived recording (pope francis) [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] michael barbaro It’s estimated that thousands of Indigenous children died in the church run system. The Pope, while meeting with Indigenous people on their land, called the church’s abuses a “disastrous error.” archived recording (pope francis) I’ve waited 50 years for this apology. And finally, today, I heard it. michael barbaro
0~Erdogan Faces a Challenge He Can’t Easily Bully: Turkey’s Economy~ISTANBUL — President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long made clear that he considered no part of Turkish life beyond his reach, not least the economy. Even before he was re-elected in June with sultanlike powers, he had built his popularity on sustained economic growth fueled by signature megaprojects — the latest being plans for a canal bisecting the country. But critics have long charged that much of that expansion was built on budgetary sleight of hand, cronyism and corruption. Now Turkey’s worst economic crisis since 2001 — the currency hit another new low on Monday — has confronted Mr. Erdogan with the limits of his authoritarian approach and could end his long run of success. It is also fanning fears of a global contagion, as Turkey’s troubles undermine investor confidence in other emerging market economies and raise concerns about the exposure of banks even in developed regions, like the European Union.
0~After Dramatic Walkout, a New Fight Looms Over Voting Rights in Texas~State Representative Matt Krause, a conservative Republican from Fort Worth, described himself as “disappointed and frustrated” by the walkout. But he said he believed the bill would ultimately pass, if not in the next special session, then in another after that. “It’s going to be heavily debated and contested,” he said. “But at the end of the day, during a special session, I think we’ll get it done.” He and other Republicans expressed irritation that the walkout had killed not just the voting bill but several others that were important to the caucus, including bail reform. The failure to pass the bill was a striking blow to Republicans and one of the few setbacks they have suffered nationally in a monthslong push to restrict voting in states they control. G.O.P.-controlled legislatures, aligning themselves with former President Donald J. Trump’s baseless fraud claims, have passed new laws in Georgia, Florida and Iowa with expansive restrictions. The Texas bill was viewed by many Democrats and voting rights groups as perhaps the harshest of all; among other provisions, it would have banned both drive-through voting and 24-hour voting; imposed new restrictions on absentee voting; granted broad new autonomy and authority to partisan poll watchers; and increased punishments for mistakes or offenses by election officials. President Biden denounced the bill over the weekend, calling it “an assault on democracy,” and urged lawmakers to pass two Democratic voting bills that have been stalled in Congress — a theme that Texas Democrats picked up at their news conference Monday. “I’m asking Joe Biden, you need to help Texas,” said State Representative Michelle Beckley, a member of the House Elections Committee who consistently opposed the Republican bill. “We have done everything we can. The Democratic senators, you need to pass the voter bills.” Republicans in Texas and in other states that have passed new voting laws have defended them on the grounds that they will improve “election security,” even though the results of the last election have been confirmed by multiple audits, lawsuits and court decisions.
0~Global Talks on Taxing Tech Firms Will Slip Into 2021~The politics heavily feature the Trump administration, which said in June that it was pulling out of negotiations, amid disputes with other wealthy countries over the treatment of American companies that could face higher global tax bills under a new international agreement. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has pushed for a provision in any agreement that would effectively allow American corporations to choose whether or not to be governed by the global tax system set up by an agreement, a demand that other leading countries oppose. But the O.E.C.D. officials said on Monday that the administration had remained a part of the talks and had not pulled American experts out of the negotiations. “The United States has been working with us and has added its technical competence and expertise to the work the O.E.C.D. has been doing,” Mr. Gurria said. “They have been participating actively and at high levels.” The talks cover a high-stakes, and highly lucrative, issue that has emerged around the world in recent years: the question of how countries should tax the sale of goods and services to their citizens over the internet, by corporations that have little or no physical presence inside their national borders. That question has taken on greater urgency. Countries are looking for new sources of tax revenues to shore up their government budgets as they spend heavily to contain the pandemic and help their economies emerge from it as quickly as possible.

0~'Open: An Autobiography,' by Andre Agassi - The New York Times~Even those not convinced that Andre Agassi was the best tennis player of his time will readily admit he outdid all others in attracting attention, beginning in the 1980s, when he was a teenage phenom from Las Vegas who blazed onto the pro tour in flamboyant, Nike-­sponsored plumage — stone-washed denim, skintight “Hot Lava” compression shorts, midnight-at-the-roulette-wheel shades — that blinded many to the granite consistency of his game: the compact, bludgeoning ground strokes, the lethal service return, the lightning reflexes. Now, three years into his retirement, Agassi’s sterling accomplishments are again being obscured, this time by pre-publication revelations from his autobiography, “Open,” especially his admission that during one low period he found solace in crystal methamphetamine, supplied by his “assistant,” and later lied about it to tennis officials, thus avoiding a three-month suspension. Given the current scandals involving steroids and human growth hormone, Agassi’s infraction seems minor, even quaint, characterized as it was by late-night binges that more likely retarded rather than “enhanced” his match-day performances. Image Andre Agassi at the French Open in 1991 ... Credit... Patrick Kovarik/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The more arresting news is that “Open” is one of the most passionately anti-sports books ever written by a superstar athlete — bracingly devoid of triumphalist homily and star-spangled gratitude. Agassi’s announced theme is that the game he mastered was a prison he spent some 30 years trying to escape. His first cell was the backyard court his immigrant father, Mike, built behind the family’s ramshackle house in the parched outskirts of Las Vegas. Armenian, raised poor in Iran and employed as a “captain,” or usher, at a casino on the Strip, Mike Agassi was determined to groom a champion and subjected all four of his children to abusive training, yanking them out of school for extra practice time. The three eldest all crumbled under the pressure. The jackpot came with the fourth, who was blessed with preternatural hand-eye coordination, honed in daily sessions in which he swatted as many as 2,500 balls belched forth by a machine at speeds of up to 110 miles per hour, at angles so acute the 7-year-old Andre had to swing the instant the ball landed, lest it bounce over his head — the trick of hitting “on the rise” that eventually would freeze opponents, helpless as even their most blistering shots came screaming back.
0~Light Sentence for Brock Turner in Stanford Rape Case Draws Outrage~She said she was told she had been found behind a Dumpster, and learned from news reports that witnesses had discovered her attacker lying on top of her unconscious, partly clothed body. The witnesses intervened and held the attacker for the police. The judge, identified by The Guardian as a Stanford alumnus, handed Mr. Turner, a champion swimmer, far less than the maximum 14 years after he was convicted, pointing out that he had no “significant” prior offenses, he had been affected by the intense media coverage, and “there is less moral culpability attached to the defendant, who is ... intoxicated,” The Guardian said. The victim said Mr. Turner had admitted drinking, but still had not acknowledged any fault in the attack, insisting the episode had been consensual. She said the court privileged his well-being over her own, and in the end declined to punish him severely because the authorities considered the disruption to his studies and athletic career at a prestigious university when determining his sentence. She wrote: The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard-earned swimming scholarship. How fast Brock swims does not lessen the severity of what happened to me, and should not lessen the severity of his punishment. If a first-time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? The fact that Brock was an athlete at a private university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class. Michele Dauber, a law professor and sociologist at Stanford, said Monday that she was part of a committee that was organizing a recall challenge to Judge Persky, whose position is an elected one. And by Tuesday, a Change.org petition calling for the judge’s removal had garnered over 240,000 supporters.
0~Doping Scandal Includes a Direct Link to Nike’s C.E.O.~In late June, according to the email, Salazar took a pre-run urine sample from each of his two adult sons, who are not professional athletes, to determine their baseline testosterone levels. He had them run on a treadmill in an environmental chamber at Nike’s labs, then rubbed two “squirts” of a testosterone called AndroGel onto their backs. Their urine samples were again collected and tested. Brown wrote to Parker: “We have preliminary data back on our experiments with a topical male hormone called AndroGel … We found that even though there was a slight rise in T/E ratios, it was below the level of 4 which would trigger great concern … We are next going to repeat it using 3 pumps … We need to determine the minimal amount of gel that would cause a problem.” Parker responded by writing that it “will be interesting to determine the minimal amount of topical male hormone required to create a positive test.” On Tuesday, a Nike spokesman said that Salazar had performed the test because he was concerned that someone could rub testosterone on Nike runners and cause them to test positive. “Mark was shocked that this could be the case, and given Mark’s passion for running, Dr. Brown and Alberto made Mark aware of their findings,” the spokesman said. “Mark Parker had no idea that the test was outside any rules, as a medical doctor was involved. Furthermore, Mark’s understanding was that Alberto was attempting to prevent doping of his athletes.” Parker was also looped in on a series of experiments being conducted with L-carnitine, a substance that helps the body convert fat into energy. To be effective, however, the substance needs to be infused at levels that stretch beyond the limits the antidoping rules allow for infusions. According to emails turned over as part of the investigation, Salazar and Brown were running experiments on their chief scientist, Steve Magness, a competitive runner, giving him illicit doses of L-carnitine to see how his body would respond and reporting the results to Parker.

A police officer made visual contact with the gunman and fired at him, but missed. The gunman escaped. Gunman in front of McDonald’s. From video posted on Twitter by Thomas Seymat Man atop parking garage. From video posted on YouTube by Nimo A video distributed online showed a man dressed in black opening fire in front of a McDonald’s restaurant. Another video emerged of a similarly dressed man with a gun on top of a nearby parking garage. The timing of the two videos was unclear. 5 8:28 p.m. Less than a mile from the mall, in front of two police officers, the gunman killed himself with his own gun, the police said.
0~How Air-Conditioning Conquered America (Even the Pacific Northwest)~Air-conditioning has been remarkably good at creating demand for itself. It enabled the sweeping postwar development of the South, where all new single-family homes today include central air. In automobiles, it made the commutes between air-conditioned homes and air-conditioned offices possible. In the Southwest, its arrival facilitated new methods of rapid construction, replacing traditional building designs that once naturally withstood the region’s desert climate. By doing all of this, air-conditioning has contributed to the intensive energy demand that worsens climate change that, well, forces us to rely on air-conditioning, a feedback loop environmentalists fear. And so here we are, in 2017, with temperatures racing past 100 degrees in the Pacific Northwest, the region of the country that has historically relied the least on air-conditioning. And now more people, even there, are installing the technology. “The last — ay yi yi — three and a half to maybe five years, it seemed that I’ve either lost tolerance of sleeping in the heat or it’s just been hotter,” said Susan Krummann, who lives outside Portland. She’s the service manager for a heating and air-conditioning company there. But she, of all people, gave in to an installation only in late June. “I’m 55, and I deserve a little comfort,” she said.
0~Supreme Court Wrestles With Case on Pigs, Cruelty and Commerce~WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday considered whether California can address cruelty to animals by requiring that pork sold in the state come from breeding pigs housed in spaces that allow them to move around freely. There was no dispute that the state could regulate the treatment of pigs within its borders. But California produces almost no pork, even as its residents consume 13 percent of the pork produced in other states. The question for the justices was whether the law’s impact on business practices in those other states ran afoul of the Constitution. Justice Elena Kagan said she was worried that states might enact all sorts of laws effectively regulating conduct outside their borders.
0~Crackdown on Bloggers Is Mounted by China~Mr. Xue has drawn more than 12 million registered fans to his microblog. Many supporters believe that the police kindled outrage about his sexual behavior because of his sharp criticism of officials. Even Hu Xijin, an ardently pro-party newspaper editor, agreed. “Using sexual scandal, tax evasion and so on to take down political foes is a hidden rule common among governments worldwide,” Mr. Hu wrote in a comment on his Sina Weibo account that was quickly removed. The rise of microblogs has given prominent commentators a powerful, and potentially lucrative, platform. Their reach is sweeping, even discounting the many fake and dormant accounts among the fan numbers. Sina Weibo lists 347 users — a few of them companies or groups — with more than five million registered fans each; each of the top five has more than 50 million. Plenty of the most popular users are entertainment stars; others have turned their online celebrity into its own kind of stardom, with well-paid careers based on media appearances, product endorsements and books. The attention of a Big V microblogger can transform an otherwise obscure issue — a land dispute in a village, graft by a small-town official — into a subject of passionate national discussion and a headache for the government. The tone of their commentary varies from earnest outrage to sarcasm to allusive irony; the last is intended to lull censors who prowl for offensive messages. “Some of them have become more influential than certain state media organs,” said Bill Bishop, who publishes the Sinocism newsletter, closely follows Chinese Internet issues and also contributes to the DealBook blog at The New York Times. “Weibo is so fast, and the velocity and breadth of the transmission of information is just so much greater now than it is in newspapers and even on TV.” But the explosion of Weibo has also fed a dank undergrowth of frauds and fakery. Businesses use bogus “zombie” accounts to spread paid-for messages that give a boost to clients or discredit their rivals. Other operators make money by scrubbing messages that are damaging to businesses or politicians. “There is a lot of pay for play and dirty money going around,” Mr. Bishop said. The Chinese authorities have said their crackdown is directed at such abuses. The police across the country have announced the arrests of hundreds of other people accused of spreading false rumors online. The police have said Qin Zhihui, whose online name is Qin Huohuo, admitted to concocting 3,000 false rumors over three years as part of a business to create shock and attention that he could then use to advance himself and his clients. But the accusations against Mr. Qin and many other arrested microbloggers also have a political edge. Many other rumors called outrageously false by the government have dwelt on the sins of officials: corruption, venality and sexual escapades.
0~‘Camelot,’ With the Philharmonic Playing Along~The New York Philharmonic calls its charming performance of Lerner and Loewe’s “Camelot,” which opened on Wednesday night before an adoring audience, a semistaged production. Actually the staging is fairly elaborate. The cast performs atop a makeshift raked platform that extends into the Avery Fisher Hall auditorium, covering about half a dozen rows of seats up front, with the orchestra of nearly 60 performing from the rear of the stage. At one point a circular section of the platform rises dramatically to become the round table where the idealistic King Arthur gathers his legendary knights. With colorful costumes, rosters of dancers and thrusting sword-fight scenes, the production, directed by Lonny Price and choreographed by Josh Prince, is no less intricate than, say, the staging for the Broadway hit “Chicago.”
0~See Where Virus Cases Are Rising Fastest~As the Omicron variant sweeps across the planet, the global tally of new coronavirus cases has for the first time passed one million per day on average. The previous global case record set last April has already been broken three times this week. The United States, Canada and much of Western Europe are leading the surge, with both regions seeing record-breaking levels of new coronavirus cases. The daily average number of new cases in the United States on Tuesday was more than 267,000, exceeding the previous all-time peak set in January; Wednesday’s average was higher still, at more than 300,000. New cases in at least 11 European countries — Britain, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain and Switzerland — also passed their previous all-time peaks on Tuesday or Wednesday. In France, the daily case average passed 100,000. Cases in Canada have also seen a steep increase in recent days, more than doubling in a week to an average of more than 25,000. And Australia’s cases climbed to an average of more than 12,600 on Wednesday — eight times as high as just three weeks earlier. Ireland 50 100 150 avg. daily cases per 100,000 2020 2021 2022 132 217 United Kingdom 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 89 195 France 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 107 157 Spain 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 79 148 Greece 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 64 113 United States 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 76 91 Italy 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 58 90 Canada 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 23 68 Australia 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 9 50 As dramatic as these case counts are, they are also likely an undercount because of asymptomatic cases, reporting lags due to the holiday season, lack of test availability in many places and at-home tests whose results may not be reported. In the United States, where Omicron is spreading quickly, 16 states and Puerto Rico are at their all-time case records. These include states with comparatively high vaccination rates: Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island, all of which are at least 70 percent fully vaccinated. In addition to being more transmissible generally, Omicron also appears to give rise to more breakthrough infections. Washington, D.C. 50 100 150 avg. daily cases per 100,000 2020 2021 2022 46 293 New York 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 85 215 New Jersey 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 73 196 Rhode Island 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 125 157 Maryland 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 53 129 Massachusetts 50 100 150 2020 2021 2022 94 127 Similarly, some of the European countries currently facing serious surges have among the world’s highest vaccination rates. In Portugal, where 88 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, cases are up more than 200 percent in the past two weeks. Spain, where new cases have more than quintupled in the past three weeks, is 80 percent fully vaccinated. So far, overall hospitalization and death rates have not come close to reaching previous peak levels, though some places are struggling. About 78,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with the virus, compared with over 130,000 at the height of last winter’s peak. The average daily rate of deaths across much of the world also remains lower than the record rates seen earlier in the pandemic. A combination of immunity from vaccines, booster shots and previous infections is most likely at least partially responsible for lower hospitalization and mortality. Encouraging early data also suggests the Omicron variant may be less virulent than previous strains of the virus. The recent surges in all these places, however, have been fast and steep, and severe outcomes usually lag case spikes by at least a few weeks, so hospitalizations and death rates may rise in the coming days. “This is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers and health systems on the brink of collapse and again disrupting lives and livelihoods,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference on Wednesday. Case rates in South America, Asia and much of Africa have so far remained relatively low. And at least some countries that saw record case loads this month may be turning a corner. In southern Africa, where scientists first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization, cases remain higher than on the rest of the continent but appear to be abating.

Countries seeing fewer than 10 cases per 100,000 people are excluded. On Wednesday, U.S. health officials continued to stress the importance of vaccination and booster doses. In a White House news briefing, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that people eligible for a booster shot who have not yet gotten one “do have some protection against severe disease and death,” though she added that “they do have quite a bit of waning with regard to protection against infection.” That group with waning immunity comprises those who completed a Moderna or Pfizer two-dose series six months ago or more, or received a Johnson & Johnson shot at least two months ago. Although Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, discouraged large New Year’s Eve parties, his advice in the news conference Wednesday was more measured when it came to small gatherings of vaccinated people. “Although the risk is never zero in anything, the risk is low enough that we feel you should continue to go through with those plans of having a home-related, vaccinated, boosted gathering with family and close friends who are also vaccinated and boosted,” he said.
0~Cannabis Tourism Is on the Rise~Sam Rosenbaum has Stephen Colbert to thank for his career switch from accountant to cannabis tour operator. The newly minted M.B.A. was watching an episode of “The Colbert Report” in 2014 when the comedian spoke of a “cannabis green rush” coming to Colorado, which had recently become the first state to legalize recreational marijuana. “The part about bus tours kind of jumped out at me,” Mr. Rosenbaum, 34, said. “I came up with High 5 Tours and registered it the next week.” It was a prescient move. One year later, when Mr. Rosenbaum’s home state of Oregon voted to legalize cannabis, High 5 Tours was the state’s first cannabis bus tour. Image Sam Rosenbaum of High 5 Tours. Credit... High 5 Tours Mr. Rosenbaum is not alone in his attempts in growing the world of cannabis tourism. Eleven states in the United States so far have voted to allow people 21 and older to buy regulated amounts of cannabis product for consumption on private property. Sales systems are not yet in place in Michigan and Maine, and in Massachusetts a gradual licensing of dispensaries began last November. In Vermont, as in Washington, D.C., possession, growing and sharing cannabis are legal, but not buying or selling.
0~Son of Israeli Ex-President Takes Helm of Labor Party, Urging Peace~JERUSALEM — Isaac Herzog, the son of a former president, took the helm of Israel’s Labor Party and thus Parliament’s opposition on Friday, vowing to restore the party’s historic focus on promoting peace with the Palestinians and to mount a vigorous challenge to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-leaning government. “Only bold steps toward peace with the Palestinians will enable us to break through on all fronts,” Mr. Herzog said at a news conference in Tel Aviv. “I am not sure — I have grave doubts — whether Prime Minister Netanyahu understands this and if he’s working toward it.” Promising to “restore the political banner to center stage” for “the sake of a just state,” he said he would “outflank those in power until we return to lead the country.” A lawyer universally known as Buji and a father of three, Mr. Herzog, 53, hails from a beloved Israeli dynasty: His father, Chaim Herzog, a military man and diplomat, served as Israel’s sixth president, from 1983 to 1993, and his grandfather Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog was the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of the modern state.
0~Alex Cora Ousted by Red Sox After Sign-Stealing Scandal~The statement was issued jointly with Cora, who thanked the team’s executives and called his two seasons with the Red Sox “the best years of my life.” Cora, 44, added that he did not want to be a distraction for the team, but his statement did not include an apology or an admission of wrongdoing, either with the Astros or with the Red Sox. A report published last week in The Athletic said the 2018 Red Sox had also broken the rules by using technology to steal signs. According to that report, which cited three unnamed people who were with the Red Sox that season, some players would use the video replay room, which is intended for teams to use to determine whether to challenge on-field calls, to decode sign sequences during games. M.L.B. is probing those allegations against Boston, and Manfred said in his report that he would wait until that investigation is over to determine Cora’s punishment. But considering that Luhnow and Hinch were both suspended for a year — even though they were found not to be involved in the planning or execution of the Astros’ ploy — it stands to reason that discipline for Cora could be even more severe, especially if the Boston accusations are confirmed. For the Red Sox, Monday’s report was damaging enough to force them to act on Cora. The league said it had conducted at least 68 interviews and reviewed thousands of videos and documents, and the nine-page report repeatedly referenced Cora’s involvement. The Astros used video equipment to decipher a catcher’s signs, and that information was relayed to batters by various methods — most often by having someone bang on a nearby trash can with a bat; the number of hits on the trash can indicated what type of pitch was coming. “Cora was involved in developing both the banging scheme and utilizing the replay review room to decode and transmit signs,” the report said. “Cora participated in both schemes, and through his active participation, implicitly condoned the players’ conduct.” Cora was considered a rising star during his time with the Astros, and had already agreed to become the Red Sox manager before the end of the 2017 World Series. He held many of the now-popular qualifications for managing jobs — he is a strong, bilingual communicator with deep family roots in the game, had recently played in the major leagues and is comfortable with the news media after his years as an analyst for ESPN. After hiring Cora, the Red Sox — at his request — sent a delegation to his native Puerto Rico to help after Hurricane Maria.
0~A Player Convicted of Rape Hopes to Return to Soccer~LONDON — As a professional soccer player, Ched Evans never became a household name with his appearances for several of Britain’s best-known clubs. But as a convicted rapist seeking to re-enter the professional game after his release from prison last week, he has suddenly become the focal point of an impassioned national debate. The issue: whether Evans, 25, a striker whose résumé includes largely unheralded stints at Manchester City, Norwich City, Sheffield United and a place on the national team of Wales, should be allowed to return to the sport, or be excluded on moral grounds from any further playing career, at least in the professional leagues. England’s professional soccer clubs are no strangers to controversy over the behavior of players who breach sporting and social codes on and off the field. Episodes of racial abuse and violence against opponents, including several involving some of the top players in the sport, have resulted in a long succession of suspensions and fines. Evans’s case, and the emotions and public reaction to his effort to return to the field, echo a continuing debate in the United States — set off by the recent arrests of several prominent N.F.L. players for charges including domestic violence and child abuse — about whether an athlete’s actions off the field should have consequences on it.
0~Trump Lawyer on Call Is a Conservative Firebrand Aiding His Push to Overturn Election~As President Trump has sought to overturn the election results, his personal lawyers paraded themselves before television hosts, state elections officials and anyone else willing to entertain their baseless claims of voter fraud. But behind the scenes, a longtime conservative lawyer named Cleta Mitchell quietly helped. Her work for Mr. Trump drew widespread attention for the first time over the weekend, when a recording was released of an hourlong call in which Mr. Trump threatened Georgia elections officials with “a criminal offense” if they failed to “find” enough votes to change the state’s presidential results. On the call, Ms. Mitchell repeatedly jumped in to help Mr. Trump, showing an intimate level of involvement in his efforts as they made baseless claims about the election and pressed Georgia officials to hand over election data. Ms. Mitchell is a partner at the law firm Foley & Lardner, which has over 1,000 lawyers and an office in nearly every major city in the United States and represents large corporations such as CVS Pharmacy. Her presence on the call stood out because Mr. Trump has struggled to attract high-profile lawyers to aid his attempts to overturn the election, instead relying on a group that has included Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who has pushed outlandish claims in defense of Mr. Trump throughout his presidency, and Sidney Powell, who has espoused conspiracy theories.
0~Banksy Painting Self-Destructs After Fetching $1.4 Million at Sotheby’s~LONDON — The British street artist Banksy pulled off one of his most spectacular pranks on Friday night, when one of his trademark paintings appeared to self-destruct at Sotheby’s in London after selling for $1.4 million at auction. The work, “Girl With Balloon,” a 2006 spray paint on canvas, was the last lot of Sotheby’s “Frieze Week” evening contemporary art sale. After competition between two telephone bidders, it was hammered down by the auctioneer Oliver Barker for 1 million pounds, more than three times the estimate and a new auction high for a work solely by the artist, according to Sotheby’s. “Then we heard an alarm go off,” Morgan Long, the head of art investment at the London-based advisory firm Fine Art Group, who was sitting in the front row of the room, said in an interview on Saturday. “Everyone turned round, and the picture had slipped through its frame.” The painting, mounted on a wall close to a row of Sotheby’s staff members, had been shredded, or at least partially shredded, by a remote-control mechanism on the back of the frame.
0~Bernie Sanders Looks to Topple Elizabeth Warren in Her Home State~“If we have the largest voter turnout in the history of Massachusetts primary — we can win here in Massachusetts, we can win the Democratic nomination,” he said. He did not mention the South Carolina primary. So far, Mr. Sanders has advertised more heavily than Ms. Warren in her home state, deployed about a dozen staff members, set up four field offices, had 1,500 volunteer events and organized canvassers to knock on 50,000 doors just last weekend, according to his campaign. Mr. Sanders even used his Twitter platform to amplify a local zoning and redevelopment fight in East Boston this week. In an apparent nod to the urgency of the situation, a super PAC supporting Ms. Warren announced late Thursday that it was buying up television time in Boston to give her a last-minute boost. Ms. Warren has declined several times to call Massachusetts a must-win state — twice in a CNN town hall on Wednesday and again Saturday morning while campaigning in Columbia, S.C. Asked about Mr. Sanders’s presence in the state, she told reporters: “I know that Massachusetts is a very progressive state and progressive ideas are very popular. And so I’m sure that’s why Bernie is campaigning there.” In Springfield, Mr. Sanders’s supporters were relishing the possibility of a win. Lindsay Sabadosa, a state representative in Massachusetts and co-chairwoman of the Sanders campaign in the state, almost mockingly appropriated some of Ms. Warren’s own rhetoric as she introduced him, saying she was “counting down the days until election night.” “Not only because I am ready for a new president — and let me tell you, I am ready for a new president — but because I am ready for a new president who believes in big, bold structural change and who has the courage, the passion and the plans to make it happen,” she said. There has been limited polling in Massachusetts. One survey, from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, taken after the New Hampshire primary but before Mr. Sanders won Nevada, showed a statistical dead heat, with Mr. Sanders at 21 percent and Ms. Warren at 20 percent. Another, from the radio station WBUR, showed Mr. Sanders opening a lead, with 25 percent to Ms. Warren’s 17 percent.
0~A Strike Stops the Music of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra~In the latest labor flare-up in the classical world, the musicians of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra went on strike Thursday after contract talks broke down, forcing the cancellation of this weekend’s performances. Many orchestras have been buffeted in recent years by budget cuts, strikes and lockouts, while some larger ensembles have agreed to record-setting compensation deals. All eyes are now on the ongoing contract negotiations at the storied Philadelphia Orchestra, whose musicians had their pay reduced when the orchestra went into bankruptcy in 2011. The musicians of the Fort Worth orchestra, who noted that they had accepted a 13.5 percent pay cut in 2010 to help the ensemble weather the recession, said in a statement that they “refuse to agree to more damaging cuts.” While ticket sales have increased over the past two seasons, the administration said that expenses have risen and donations have dropped — in part, it said, because of the recent downturn in the oil and gas industries. The orchestra is facing a projected $700,000 deficit in the coming season on a budget of roughly $12 million. The strike was called after more than a year of often contentious negotiations. Musicians are currently paid for 46 weeks a year, management said, which includes 42 days of paid leave and vacation. The rejected proposal would have cut the players’ paid weeks to 43 for the first two years of the contract, then raise the number to 44 for the next two years.
0~Federal Reserve Releases Economic Projections~WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it would leave interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future as the central bank projected high unemployment for several years and a long slog back from the pandemic-induced recession. In their first economic projections this year, Fed officials indicated that they expect the unemployment rate to end 2020 at 9.3 percent and remain elevated for some time, coming in at 5.5 percent in 2022. That would be well above the level they expect to prevail over the longer run in a healthy economy and far above the historically low jobless rates that preceded the virus. ”Many millions have lost their jobs,” Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell said at a news conference following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting, adding the extent of the downturn and pace of the recovery remain “extraordinarily uncertain.” Mr. Powell said the Fed will do “whatever we can, and for as long as it takes” to support the recovery and “limit lasting damage” to the economy.

0~Siege of 163d Street: Police Take Over Drug-Ridden Block to Save It~Crossed arms and uneasy glances met Police Officer Miguel Adorno as he began his pitch. Women interrupted him and old men shook their heads. But such suspicion did not deter him as he urged residents of the drug-worn block to take a stand against the dealers and violence that for years have been its standard. ''We are here to help you and will stay as long as it takes, but you have to use this time to organize yourselves,'' said the young officer, trying to encourage them to form a tenants' association. ''Alone, you will always be victims. But with numbers, you can save this block.'' Officer Adorno's pitch was a crucial part of an intensive experiment undertaken by the 33d Precinct in Washington Heights in an effort to salvage some of the neighborhood's most blighted blocks. Under the program begun last month, police officers, themselves often the object of suspicion and fear on these streets, have injected themselves into the daily lives of the residents to an extraordinary degree. The block-by-block effort, first introduced on 163d Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, began with an all-out drug sweep to clear out dealers and shutter stores used as drug markets. Then, the police set up barricades and stationed officers at each end of the block, 24 hours a day. They stop unfamiliar pedestrians and drivers, asking for identification and turning away anyone who does not live on the block or have a convincing reason to be there.
0~Hard Knock Life: What Are the Turtles Telling Me?~Knock, knock. Who’s there? Nobody. Twice, I heard a rapping at our front door, and twice I looked out the window to see no one. Either I was losing my mind, or someone was playing a practical joke. The third time, I yanked the door open. Ah ha! I was about to slam it shut when I looked down to see, standing on my threshold, a turtle. Frank the turtle, to be exact. The Eastern box turtle is the official reptile of my state, Tennessee. (The state reptile of New York, in case you’re wondering, is the snapping turtle. Similar, but it bites.) We live in an old, wooded Nashville neighborhood, a few blocks from 3,000 acres of parkland. Rabbits, skunks, turkeys and deer also frequent our yard, and I try to respect their wildness rather than treat them like the cast of a Disney movie. I would never, say, try to capture any of these creatures to make them live inside my house and wear tiny pants. I do name them sometimes, though — as I had done with Frank, whom I’ve known for the four years my family has lived in this house. Sometimes he wanders onto our back porch and I’ll hear one of the kids say, “Oh, hey Frank.” But the knocking was new, and it soon became a regular thing. Now that we knew it wasn’t a burglar or an obnoxious joke, we didn’t mind, although we worried that Frank might hurt himself, banging his head against the door. We’d just pick him up and move him to a shady spot. “Frank’s pranks,” as we dubbed them, became a problem only when Frank started knocking in the middle of the night. One morning I woke to my husband sitting up, rubbing his eyes. “What’s wrong?” I asked. “I didn’t sleep all night,” he said. “I had to keep moving Frank.”
0~As Robots Grow Smarter, American Workers Struggle to Keep Up~Yet there is deep uncertainty about how the pattern will play out now, as two trends are interacting. Artificial intelligence has become vastly more sophisticated in a short time, with machines now able to learn, not just follow programmed instructions, and to respond to human language and movement. At the same time, the American work force has gained skills at a slower rate than in the past — and at a slower rate than in many other countries. Americans between the ages of 55 and 64 are among the most skilled in the world, according to a recent report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Younger Americans are closer to average among the residents of rich countries, and below average by some measures. Clearly, many workers feel threatened by technology. In a recent New York Times/CBS News/Kaiser Family Foundation poll of Americans between the ages of 25 and 54 who were not working, 37 percent of those who said they wanted a job said technology was a reason they did not have one. Even more — 46 percent — cited “lack of education or skills necessary for the jobs available.” Self-driving vehicles are an example of the crosscurrents. They could put truck and taxi drivers out of work — or they could enable drivers to be more productive during the time they used to spend driving, which could earn them more money. But for the happier outcome to happen, the drivers would need the skills to do new types of jobs. The challenge is evident for white-collar jobs, too. Ad sales agents and pilots are two jobs that the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects will decline in number over the next decade. Flying a plane is largely automated today and will become more so. And at Google, the biggest seller of online ads, software does much of the selling and placing of search ads, meaning there is much less need for salespeople.
0~As Costs Skyrocket, More U.S. Cities Stop Recycling~“Recycling has been dysfunctional for a long time,” said Mitch Hedlund, executive director of Recycle Across America, a nonprofit organization that pushes for more standardized labels on recycling bins to help people better sort material. “But not many people really noticed when China was our dumping ground.” Perhaps counterintuitively, the big winners appear to be the nation’s largest recyclers, like Waste Management and Republic Services, which are also large trash collectors and landfill owners. Recycling had been one of the least lucrative parts of their business, trailing hauling and landfills. Analysts say many waste companies had historically viewed recycling as a “loss leader,” offering the service largely to win over a municipality’s garbage business. That equation is starting to change. While there remains a viable market in the United States for scrap like soda bottles and cardboard, it is not large enough to soak up all of the plastics and paper that Americans try to recycle. The recycling companies say they cannot depend on selling used plastic and paper at prices that cover their processing costs, so they are asking municipalities to pay significantly more for their recycling services. Some companies are also charging customers additional “contamination” fees for recycled material that is mixed in with trash. The higher recycling fees, analysts say, will help bolster the largest companies’ already booming businesses. Waste Management reported strong operating profits in 2018, while Republic reported increased revenue driven by its waste business. Most of the industry’s landfill increases were driven by economic growth: The more Americans consume, the more garbage they generate. But at least some of the higher volume were recyclables that could not be sold and repurposed, analysts say.

0~Prosecutors Pursue Inquiry Into Trump’s Handling of Classified Material~The documents in question are believed to have been kept in the residence of the White House before they were boxed up and sent to Mar-a-Lago. The investigation is focused on how the documents made their way to the residence, who boxed them up, whether anyone knew that classified materials were being improperly taken out of the White House and how they were ultimately stored in Mar-a-Lago, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. An investigation in 2016 into Hillary Clinton over a similar issue involving her personal email account ended without her being charged. And in the case of Mr. Trump, legal experts said, presidents have the ability while in office to essentially declassify whatever information they want, further complicating any possible prosecution. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. The classified documents in question are considered presidential records under federal law. Because of that distinction, Mr. Trump’s lawyers were notified of the Justice Department’s request, giving them the opportunity to block their release by going to court to quash the subpoena. It is unclear if the lawyers have responded. Last year, Mr. Trump’s lawyer unsuccessfully went to court to stop the National Archives from handing over a range of presidential records to the special congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol. The question of how Mr. Trump has handled sensitive material and documents he received as president loomed throughout his time in the White House, and beyond it. He was known to rip up pieces of official paper that he was handed, forcing officials to tape them back together because it is illegal to destroy presidential records. And an upcoming book by a New York Times reporter reveals that residence staff would find clumps of torn-up paper clogging a toilet, and believed he had thrown them in. They did not know the subjects or contents of the documents. The investigation of the classified documents adds to an array of legal problems Mr. Trump still faces 15 months after he left office. A local prosecutor in Atlanta is investigating whether he and his allies illegally interfered with Georgia’s 2020 election results, and the New York State attorney general is investigating the finances of Mr. Trump’s company. Despite Mr. Trump’s role in helping incite the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 and his other efforts to disrupt the counting and certification of the election, there has been no indication to date that the Justice Department has begun examining any criminal culpability he might have in those matters.
0~Google’s File on Me Was Huge. Here’s Why It Wasn’t as Creepy as My Facebook Data.~Brian Fitzpatrick, the former Google manager who led the team that created Takeout, put it another way. “Companies are gathering this data about you,” he said. “This is just an honest way to look at it.” My take: It is helpful to see that this data is collected. But it should be labeled precisely — like “Pages We Know You Visited” — so people can find this data more easily and decide whether to delete it. • A subfolder labeled Android contained a detailed history of the Android apps I had opened over the past three years, including the time and date I had launched each app. For example, my log showed I opened the Instagram app in March, the Gmail app in December 2015 and the Google Play Music app in January 2016. Google uses this information for a feature called app suggestions. The company studies which apps you use, and how often and when you open them, to recommend apps you might want to use throughout the day. For example, if you regularly open Instagram during your lunch break, Google will show a shortcut for the Instagram app at around 12:30 p.m. in a list of suggested apps. That is a thoughtful feature, but it gave me pause. That level of logging is almost as creepy as a company monitoring all of my keystrokes. Also, retaining this app data for several years feels like an unnecessarily long time. I ultimately opted to turn app suggestions off. • Many files in my archive were odd formats that were not easy to open or read. For example, some files included the extension .JSON. My Google Maps location history was stored in a .JSON file, and it displayed an unintelligible list of GPS coordinates and time stamps. Google explained that Takeout was designed for people to be able to easily remove their data from Google and use it elsewhere. Files like those with the .JSON extension are common formats designed to be machine readable so that other programs and tools can make use of the data, according to Google.
0~Biden Tells Voters to Look to the Past. (Just Not the Last Week.)~MANCHESTER, N.H. — For months, he played the big-talking front-runner, swaggering if rarely steady, hoping voters would not linger long on the tautology of his premise: Joe Biden was the candidate who should win, he told fellow Democrats, because he was the candidate who could win. So it was with some apparent humility — and then plenty of residual swagger — that Mr. Biden, days off a fourth-place debacle in Iowa, opened Friday night’s debate with an unusual prediction: He would probably do some more losing next week. “I took a hit in Iowa,” the former vice president allowed. “I’ll probably take a hit here.” Since joining the race last year, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the safe choice for risk-averse times, the O.K.-that’ll-do option for Democrats whose chief priority has been finding the candidate best positioned to defeat President Trump. But with Mr. Biden’s setback in Iowa and a slate of flawed competitors beside him onstage on Friday — their shortcomings laid bare in several punchy exchanges throughout the night — the party has been left to consider an unsettling truth. There is no safe option. And that is starting to feel especially risky. For a perpetually anxious party, the gathering on Friday supplied an untimely forum to air the weaknesses of several top contenders, aided by the man whose standing has fallen the fastest.
0~Israel’s Government in Crisis After Senior Lawmaker Quits Coalition~JERUSALEM — Israel’s fragile government was thrown into crisis on Wednesday after a senior lawmaker quit the coalition, leaving it without a majority in Parliament and auguring a return to the political instability that has hobbled the country in recent years. Idit Silman, the chairwoman of the governing coalition and effectively its chief whip, said in a letter to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett that she was resigning because coalition colleagues had failed to compromise and that the government’s direction did not reflect the values of the right-wing voters who brought their party, Yamina, to power. She said it was time to change course and to try to form a new “national, Jewish, Zionist” coalition with right-wing lawmakers. The move followed prolonged tensions among leftist, secular, Arab and right-wing members of the coalition, a fractious group of eight parties that agreed to work together only last June after four inconclusive elections in two years had left the country without a functional government or a state budget. The coalition crisis comes at a delicate time after a series of deadly terrorist attacks that had already put pressure on the government. Israel’s security forces remain on high alert amid fears of more unrest and violence over the next month, when the rare convergence of Ramadan, Passover and Easter is expected to raise tensions further between Israelis and Palestinians.
0~The C.D.C.’s New Leader Follows the Science. Is That Enough?~“I’m going to pause here, I’m going to lose the script and I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,” she said, her eyes glistening with tears. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope. But right now I’m scared.” Her impassioned speech startled many people, perhaps none more than her husband. “She’s not a crier — if anything, I get choked up much more easily than she does,” he said. Her openness signaled her “genuine anguish” about the state of the pandemic, he added. “She deeply felt the weight of a half a million dead.” The day of her urgent plea, she appeared on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show,” where she said vaccinated people “do not carry the virus” — an overly optimistic statement that the C.D.C. had to walk back. Later that week, new guidance from the agency said that vaccinated people could safely travel, but Dr. Walensky added that the agency did not actually want them to travel at all, a stance that left some Americans perplexed. The most recent instance, when Dr. Walensky announced that vaccinated people could go mask-free indoors, was supported by the latest research, scientists said. But many felt the agency had rushed the decision to end mask use without considering parts of the country where infections were still high, and without grasping the mistrust and culture clashes the new advice would engender. “C.D.C. got the medical and epidemiological science right, but what they did not get right was the behavioral science, the communications and working collaboratively with other stakeholders,” Dr. Gounder said. “That was a big oversight.” Data since the announcement seem to have proved Dr. Walensky correct: Infections are still declining, even as much of the country reopens at a vigorous pace. And as promised, the agency has set about issuing more practical masking guidance regarding settings like summer camps (mostly no) and public transportation (yes). Dr. Walensky and the C.D.C. declined to comment on how the mask recommendations were handled. But Dr. Fauci said that he believed some small missteps were inevitable, and that Dr. Walensky was a quick study.
0~Oculus Quest 2 Review: Solid V.R. Headset, but Few Games~So-So Games I asked Oculus product managers to name a few of their favorite games that would show the Quest 2’s strengths. Ultimately, I felt most weren’t worth my money. Consider Beat Saber, a rhythm game that involves swinging your arms to hit objects with light sabers. At first, this felt like a fun demonstration of the Quest 2’s three-dimensional motion-sensing capabilities. But it got old quickly because it reminded me of Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero, two popular rhythm games from more than a decade ago. Another recommended title was Phantom: Covert Ops. It’s a stealth game where you sneak into enemy bases by rowing around a kayak and shooting opponents from the boat. This game, which is played sitting down, got frustrating quickly because the rowing motions are tedious. I also couldn’t stop thinking about how the premise of a stealth kayak was laughably implausible and how much I’d rather be playing Metal Gear Solid, the stealth game that this one imitates. (In that game, at least I got to move around with legs.) I picked out other games that suited my interests. PokerStars VR was an interesting approach to online poker: Just like in a casino poker room, you sit at a card table and use the controllers to pick up your chips and cards, while the players around you have conversations using their microphones. This made me nostalgic for my old in-person vice, but sitting on the couch waiting for cards to be dealt while wearing a headset and controllers tired my eyes and made my body feel stiff. I also downloaded Cook-Out: A Sandwich Tale, because it was on Oculus’s list of most popular games. True to its name, the game is about assembling sandwiches to serve to customers. This game (can a task even be called a game?) got boring almost immediately. It also made me ponder why I spend so much money in real life on sandwiches when I could easily make them on my own. My favorite game, which was recommended by Oculus staff, was FitXR, the boxing simulator, in large part because I took boxing classes for many years. The game makes clever use of the motion controllers to require players to do realistic punching motions; wimpy punches don’t score points. There were always plenty of players online to compete with, which kept me motivated through each workout. In the end, I paid $110 for the Oculus games and only felt happy with the $30 I spent on FitXR. I regretted spending $20 to $30 on the other titles because they brought me minutes of entertainment, not hours. In contrast, a mainstream game for PlayStation or Nintendo typically costs $60, but provides dozens of hours of entertainment.
0~Sérgio Moro, el juez que quiere limpiar la política brasileña desde los tribunales~CURITIBA, Brasil — Afuera del tribunal las camisetas con la imagen del juez Sérgio Moro se venden a 12 dólares; graciosos pasaportes de la llamada “República de Curitiba” —la ciudad que se ha convertido en la capital de la lucha judicial contra la corrupción— se venden en tres dólares cada uno. Dentro de su despacho, hay pocas señales del esplendor y el estatus de culto que rodean al jurista de 45 años que ha sacudido a Brasil al sentenciar a prisión por cargos de corrupción a algunos de los políticos y empresarios más poderosos del país. Su escritorio es un desastre, con carpetas abultadas, libros y material impreso que se apila arbitrariamente hasta que alcanza una altura de más de 30 centímetros. A través del pasillo, se llega a su tribunal —manejado por un encargado que usa tenis y jeans— que parece un salón de clases atiborrado con filas de sillas baratas. Por título oficial y rango es un juez federal relativamente común, uno más de los cientos que hay en el país. Sin embargo, Sérgio Moro se ha convertido en el rostro de la rendición de cuentas para la clase gobernante de Brasil. Él ha supervisado algunos de los casos de corrupción más grandes del país, incluida la condena del expresidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva el mes pasado, una de las figuras brasileñas más influyentes en las últimas décadas. En el proceso impulsó un sistema legal en el que las apelaciones interminables y los retrasos garantizaban que nadie fuera responsable en los casos de corrupción.
0~Musical.ly, a Chinese App Big in the U.S., Sells for $1 Billion~SHANGHAI — The only Chinese social media company to build a major network outside China will be taken over by a fast-growing Chinese upstart. Musical.ly, a video-based social network popular with teenagers in the United States and Europe, is being sold for between $800 million and $1 billion to Bytedance, the company that controls the Chinese news aggregator Toutiao, according to a person familiar with the matter. The deal knits together Toutiao’s 120 million Chinese users with the roughly 60 million who use Musical.ly in the United States and Europe, ultimately linking a platform in China with a more global one. Musical.ly will continue to operate a separate product, according to a statement on the deal, though the two companies will cooperate closely.
0~At Site of Deaths, Our Reporters Find Cost of U.S.-ISIS Battle~Right now, the battle for Mosul is in its most dangerous phase for civilians, with the fight reaching into the twisting alleys and densely populated areas of the old city. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are pinned down here in tight quarters with Islamic State fighters who do not care if they live or die. At the same time, more American Special Operations troops, some dressed in black uniforms and driving black vehicles — the colors of their Iraqi counterparts — are closer to the front lines. That way, in theory, the targeting of Islamic State fighters should become more precise for the coalition. Another 200 American soldiers, from the 82nd Airborne Division, are heading to Iraq to support that battle over the next few days. Many Iraqi commanders welcome the more aggressive American role, saying that coalition officers were too risk averse under the Obama administration. Iraqis also say fighting for the dense, urban spaces of western Mosul requires more airpower, even if that means more civilians will die. When those decisions turn tragic, it looks like this: a panorama of destruction in the neighborhood of Mosul Jidideh so vast one resident compared the destruction to that of Hiroshima, Japan, where the United States dropped an atomic bomb in World War II. There was a charred arm, wrapped in a piece of red fabric, poking from the rubble; rescue workers in red jump suits who wore face masks to avoid the stench, some with rifles slung over their shoulders, searched the wreckage for bodies.

0~Steve Paxton, a Buddha of American Dance~EAST CHARLESTON, Vt. — Most mornings around 11, five or six dancers meet in a sun-filled studio in this remote area of northern Vermont to dance and work out. But Steve Paxton — by far the most famous dancer in the area — generally chooses to sit out these gatherings, even though the studio is part of his home. “I have such an ingrained habit of physical awareness that it’s hard for me to move without thinking about it in a workout way,” Mr. Paxton, 78, said. It was a late summer morning and he was sitting at a round table, gazing out a picture window at the landscape surrounding Mad Brook Farm, a commune that over the years has been heavily populated by artists and dancers. He has lived there since 1970. These days he is hyperaware of everyday activities, he explained, often asking himself: “How goes the walking? How goes the standing? How goes the moving? How goes the compost-turning?” Pausing, he added: “I am my own medium.” While he admits to doing a little yoga and a little tai chi, he said now he mostly just does his own thing. “I figure it’s all just patty-cake, whatever I do.” And no, he doesn’t perform much anymore: “It’s not the body that I like to dance in. Now you see an old fart kind of messing around.”
0~Federal Court Rules California's Ban on High-Capacity Magazines Violates 2nd Amendment~California’s ban on high-capacity magazines violates the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment, a federal appeals court ruled on Friday. In a split decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit gave several reasons for rejecting the state’s ban. Among them, the court said that high-capacity magazines are “protected arms” under the Second Amendment and that they are often used for legal purposes and are not considered “unusual arms” that would fall outside the scope of constitutional protection. Judge Kenneth K. Lee, who wrote the majority opinion, noted that California enacted the ban on large-capacity magazines, or LCMs, that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition after “heart-wrenching and highly publicized mass shootings.” “But even well-intentioned laws must pass constitutional muster,” he wrote. “California’s near-categorical ban of LCMs strikes at the core of the Second Amendment — the right to armed self defense.”
0~Why Adjustable-Rate Mortgages Are Still Risky~“For a borrower who wants to buy right now, they can realize significant savings” by choosing an ARM, he said. The average starting rate on adjustable-rate loans with an initial fixed-rate period of five years was 4.04 percent, compared with 5.09 percent for a fixed-rate loan, as of Thursday, according to Freddie Mac. That difference represents savings of more than $200 a month on a $350,000 loan — at least to start. “That’s real money,” Dr. Fratantoni said. Some borrowers use the savings to pay down the principal on their loan during the initial, lower-rate period, saving money over the life of the loan, Mr. Rugg said. “If you can afford it, I recommend putting the savings away or applying it to principal,” he said. The catch, of course, is that the rate can rise after the fixed-rate period expires. Compared with ARMs available before the financial crisis, which offered low “teaser” rates and allowed rates to be reset quickly, today’s adjustable-rate loans are safer, mortgage experts say. They typically have a fixed-rate period of at least three years and limits on how often, and how much, the rate can rise after that — such as one change per year of no more than two percentage points. And the risky ARMs that let borrowers pay just the interest on the loan or choose their own payment amount are no longer widely available. Still, borrowers may see their rates increase after the initial repayment period. So they need to plan ahead to be sure they can afford bigger payments if they can’t sell their house or refinance the loan. No one can say for sure what rates will be in five to seven years, but right now, they are rising. “There’s not much room to go down, and there’s a lot of room to go up,” said Martin Seay, associate professor of personal financial planning at Kansas State University. It’s wise to calculate what your payment would be if the rate rose to the loan’s cap. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers a guide to adjustable-rate mortgages that can help you evaluate your loan. You can also calculate the higher payment yourself using online tools like one offered by Freddie Mac. ARMs are more complex than traditional mortgages, with more terms to understand and potential changes to keep track of, so borrowers need to take time to truly understand the terms of the loan.
0~Ian Paisley Dies at 88; Longtime Voice of Hard-Line Ulster Who Then Made Peace~The next year, Mr. Paisley — white-haired, 82 and seemingly mellowed — resigned as Northern Ireland’s first minister and as leader of the Democratic Unionists, by then the dominant party of Ulster’s Protestants, which he founded in 1971. He had already stepped down as head of the Free Presbyterian Church, which he founded in 1951, and had given up the seat he had held for 28 years in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. In 2010 he gave up the seat in the British House of Commons that he had held for 40 years. It was the winding down of a tumultuous career as a rabble-rousing minister-politician whose single-minded objective had been to preserve Protestant power and repress the Roman Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, keeping Ulster aligned with Britain, across the Irish Sea, and out of the reach — he would have said the clutches — of predominantly Catholic Ireland to the south. From the 1950s, when he organized vigilante patrols to defend Protestant neighborhoods against I.R.A. attacks, through decades of deadly turmoil — bombings, assassinations, clashes with British troops and general strikes and riots he had fomented — Mr. Paisley barnstormed the province, condemning any peace deal that might open the way to power-sharing with Catholics in Northern Ireland, which has nearly 1.8 million people. In the pulpit or at Stormont — the Northern Ireland Parliament, which had been emblematic of Protestant hegemony since the partition of Ireland in 1921 — Mr. Paisley was a spellbinding orator, a thundering Jeremiah of relentless political attacks laced with biblical references. The Catholic Church, Sinn Fein, the I.R.A., Irish leaders, even interfering American presidents were all targets of the Paisley wrath. He called Pope John Paul II the Antichrist. He said he wanted to kick Bill Clinton in the pants for his peace efforts. He refused to attend negotiations and accused some British leaders of plotting to sell Belfast out to what he called the devils in Dublin. His demands for the removal of an Irish flag from Sinn Fein’s Belfast office once led to two days of rioting. And he said “no” to almost everything — to civil rights for Catholics, to meetings with Irish leaders, and especially to power-sharing proposals.

In the video, recorded this month and reported on earlier by Bloomberg, Mr. Kalanick is seen in the back seat of an Uber car with two women. When they reach their destination, he begins talking with the driver, Fawzi Kamel. During the exchange, Mr. Kamel complains about what he says is Uber’s history of lowering earnings for drivers, and Mr. Kalanick says Mr. Kamel should “take responsibility” for his own problems. The conversation quickly becomes heated, with Mr. Kalanick using obscenities and generally being dismissive of Mr. Kamel’s complaints.
0~Cheney facing internal backlash for impeachment vote as Republican rifts deepen over Trump.~A group of President Trump’s most strident allies in the House is calling on Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican, to resign from her leadership post after she voted to impeach Mr. Trump, dramatizing the bitter rifts within the party and setting up a messy internal feud that could define its future. Members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, including the chairman, Representative Andy Biggs of Arizona, as well as Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Matt Gaetz of Florida, are circulating a petition calling on Ms. Cheney to step down from her role as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, arguing that her vote to impeach Mr. Trump had “brought the conference into disrepute and produced discord.” Ms. Cheney was one of 10 Republicans to break with the party on Wednesday and vote to charge the president with “incitement of insurrection” for his role in urging on a mob that stormed the Capitol. “One of those 10 cannot be our leader,” Mr. Gaetz said in an interview on Fox News’s “Hannity” on Wednesday evening. “It is untenable, unsustainable, and we need to make a leadership change.”

0~Extra Johnson & Johnson Shot Boosts Protection Against Covid~A second dose of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine substantially increased its protection against Covid-19, the company announced Tuesday morning. In a clinical trial, researchers found that two doses of the vaccine delivered 94 percent efficacy against mild to severe Covid-19 in the United States, up from 74 percent conferred with a single shot, the company reported. And two shots showed 100 percent efficacy against severe disease, although that estimate had a wide range of uncertainty. The data, presented in a news release, has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, Johnson & Johnson said. Since the company received emergency authorization in February, 14.6 million people in the United States have received its one-shot vaccine. On Friday, an F.D.A. advisory committee recommended that the agency authorize Pfizer-BioNTech booster shots for recipients of the vaccine who are at least 65 or at high risk of Covid. That vaccine, like Moderna’s, offers high levels of initial protection after two doses, which then seem to diminish slightly over several months.

0~Terrorists Mock Bids to End Use of Social Media~SAN FRANCISCO — In the hours after 14 people were killed in San Bernardino, Calif., a familiar voice celebrated the attacks on Twitter: “California, we have already arrived with our soldiers. Decide how to be your end, with knife or bomb.” That comment was posted from the 335th Twitter account of a pro-Islamic State group that calls itself Asawitiri Media. Twitter has repeatedly tried to cut off the authors of the account, most recently known to its thousands of followers as @TurMedia335, @TurMedia334 and @TurMedia333. As soon as Twitter suspends one account, a new one is created. After the group’s 99th account was suspended, it taunted Twitter by creating @IslamicState100, posting images of birthday candles, cake, trophies and fireworks. Politicians and even some technologists say that account, and hundreds just like it, show how Silicon Valley’s efforts to crack down on the use by terrorists of social media have been toothless. And Washington is using the latest terrorist attacks to renew its calls for Silicon Valley to roll back the encryption in their products. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential front-runner, called on tech companies to become more aggressive.
0~F.T.C. Sues to Block Meta’s Virtual Reality Deal as It Confronts Big Tech~“It’s a riskier case, but one they think is worth bringing because if they succeed it will help bring the frontier of enforcement outward,” said William E. Kovacic, a former chairman of the F.T.C. “I think this is a first of a kind.” The F.T.C.’s lawsuit is part of a broader wave of actions against Meta and other large tech companies like Google, Apple and Amazon, which have increasingly faced scrutiny for their power and dominance. Under Ms. Khan’s predecessor, the F.T.C. filed a lawsuit against Facebook that argued the company shut down nascent competition through acquisitions. The Justice Department has also sued Google over whether the company abused a monopoly over online search. More cases could be coming. The F.T.C. is investigating whether Amazon has violated antitrust laws, and the Justice Department has inquiries into Google’s dominance over advertising technology and into Apple’s App Store policies. For Mr. Zuckerberg, the F.T.C. lawsuit is a setback. He has been pushing Meta away from its roots in social networking as its apps, like Facebook and Instagram, face more competition amid stumbles in privacy and content moderation. Instead, he has bet on the metaverse. Mr. Zuckerberg has reassigned employees and put a top lieutenant in charge of metaverse efforts. He has also authorized executives to pursue some of the most popular games in the V.R. space. In 2019, Facebook purchased Beat Games, makers of the hit title Beat Saber, one of the top V.R. games on the Oculus platform. He has also authorized the purchase of roughly half a dozen other virtual reality or gaming studios over the past three years. The F.T.C. filed suit on Wednesday hours before Meta reported its first decline in quarterly revenue since it went public in 2012. The company has recently trimmed employee perks and reined in spending amid uncertain economic conditions. John Newman, the deputy director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition, said the agency acted on the Within deal because Meta was “trying to buy its way to the top.” The company already owned a best-selling virtual reality fitness app, he said, but then chose to acquire Within’s Supernatural app “to buy market position.” He said the deal was “an illegal acquisition, and we will pursue all appropriate relief.” The F.T.C.’s vote to authorize the filing was split 3 to 2. Christine Wilson, a Republican commissioner at the agency, said she was one of the two votes against the lawsuit. She declined to comment on her reasoning.
0~Rodrigo Duterte and Other Candidates Seeking to Lead Philippines Tap Into Aquino Fatigue~The climate of voter dissatisfaction has buoyed candidates like Mr. Duterte and Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., the leading candidate for vice president. (In the Philippines, the vice president is elected separately from the president, and often the two are political opponents.) Mr. Marcos’s father, the country’s former dictator, was accused of plundering billions from its coffers. The son speaks nostalgically on the campaign trail of his father’s era, when he says the Philippines was more successful and orderly. Both he and Mr. Duterte promise strong, decisive leadership that some say sounds like a return to dictatorship, according to Richard Heydarian, a political-science professor at De La Salle University in Manila. “What is at stake here,” Mr. Heydarian said, “isn’t Aquino’s legacy only, but the whole democratic system that supplanted the Marcos dictatorship.” Critics of Mr. Aquino note that ordinary people do not feel the benefit of a ratings upgrade or a steady growth in gross domestic product. Despite six years of relative prosperity, thousands of Filipinos still leave the country every month to work in often dangerous and degrading jobs in the Middle East because they cannot find jobs at home. Workers who do have jobs at home often find themselves commuting four or five hours a day because of the crippling traffic in Manila and other large cities. Mr. Aquino has received accolades from the World Bank and others for increasing tax collections, but critics of his administration say the greater revenue has not translated into improved infrastructure. The country’s main commuter train in Manila often breaks down, forcing people to exit on dangerous, elevated tracks, and it has been known to catch fire while moving or have its doors fly open. The country’s main airport, where sections of the roof have fallen on passengers and which has been rated one of the world’s worst, recently endured a nearly six-hour power outage that left travelers sweltering in the dark because officials had failed to maintain backup generators. Running a close second to Mr. Duterte is Grace Poe, a senator, and the daughter of one of the country’s most popular movie stars, who had to renounce her United States citizenship in order to seek office. She has cast herself as a populist but also as a young, fresh face in politics not tainted by scandal.
0~Mitch McConnell Says Marjorie Taylor Greene’s ‘Loony Lies’ Are a ‘Cancer’ on GOP~Senator Mitch McConnell said on Monday that the “loony lies and conspiracy theories” embraced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene amounted to a “cancer” on the Republican Party, issuing what in effect was a scathing rebuke to the freshman House Republican from Georgia. In a statement reported by The Hill, Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, never named Ms. Greene, but he referred to several of the outlandish and false conspiracy theories she has espoused and warned that such statements were damaging the party. “Loony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country,” Mr. McConnell said. “Somebody who’s suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.’s airplane is not living in reality. This has nothing to do with the challenges facing American families or the robust debates on substance that can strengthen our party.” House Republican leaders in the past week have been mostly silent as pressure mounted to respond to the cascade of Ms. Greene’s problematic social media posts and videos that have surfaced in the past week, in which she endorsed a seemingly endless array of conspiracy theories and violent behavior, including executing Democratic leaders. At the same time, they are weighing calls within their ranks by loyalists of former President Donald J. Trump to strip Representative Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, of her leadership post as punishment for her vote to impeach Mr. Trump.
0~A Flight to Treasury Bonds That Wasn’t Supposed to Happen~It is also sobering that a vast majority of economists and market strategists were forecasting a different chain of events. Treasury yields were universally expected to be rising, not falling, as the United States recovered from a deep recession. The domestic economy is, in fact, growing, and corporate profits have been rising, but the European crisis has overturned many expectations. Image The Parthenon, top, in Athens and the Treasury in Washington. As Greece’s debt woes have led stocks to crumble, many investors still see relative strength in Treasury bond funds. Credit... Orestis Panagiotou/European Pressphoto Agency; Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Barry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays Capital, got some of the outlines right, if not the details. “Sometimes, you’re correct for other reasons,” he said. He had predicted that after a long run upward, the stock market would fall in the first half of the year, and it has, putting stocks in “correction” territory. So far, so good. But Mr. Knapp had thought that the stock market decline would be set off by a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which has operated on an emergency basis since the onset of the financial crisis in the United States. The Fed hasn’t tightened. Instead, to keep the economy stable in the face of Europe’s problems, it has held short-term interest rates near zero. In addition, it reopened emergency swap lines with European central banks last month, to help maintain liquidity there. Similarly, Joseph H. Davis, Vanguard’s chief economist, had said it was likely that long-term interest rates would be rising and that the Fed would be moving short-term rates up more dramatically. That will still happen eventually, he said, but the timing is far from certain. “We got it wrong,” he said cheerfully. “Of course, we did warn that there was a good chance that might happen.” In a detailed 16-page analysis of the bond market in March, Mr. Davis and several Vanguard associates deconstructed Treasury yields and projected rates using the “forward yield curve,” a standard calculation of the market’s assessment of future interest rate levels. This kind of analysis makes use of the information embedded in prices, but it won’t tell you what will happen to the bond and stock markets if something unexpected arises  like Greece suddenly running into a credit wall. What comfort can be drawn from these uncertain markets? First, the Vanguard study found that even a climb in Treasury yields needn’t be devastating for well-run long-term bond portfolios, because higher yields can more than compensate for lower bond prices. Such management may not be easy to do on your own, but the study found that many mutual funds have handled the transition well in past market cycles. Second, at the moment, investment-grade bonds are very richly priced in comparison with stocks, several analysts said. Mr. Knapp says he expects that the S.& P. 500 will rise to 1,210 by the end of the year, or 13.6 percent from its current 1,064.88, and that the chances for strong longer-term stock returns are favorable. (The outlook for Treasuries is not positive, he said.)
0~Quantity of Explosive Found in Belgium Surprises Officials~The announcement by the Belgian authorities that they had confiscated more than 30 pounds of the explosive TATP from a dwelling used by the attackers in Brussels was, in some ways, an expected development. But it contained one detail that bomb-disposal technicians and security officials regarded with surprise: the quantity of the particular explosive involved. TATP, also known as triacetone triperoxide, is a white, crystalline explosive also used in the attacks in Paris in November, though it caused few casualties compared with the terrorists’ assault rifles. Highly unstable and sensitive to shock, friction and heat, it breaks down quickly in air. And while it can be made with basic chemistry skills and relatively simple equipment, it is more dangerous and tedious to manufacture than a commonly used fertilizer-based explosive, ammonium nitrate, which an American official, citing intelligence shared by Belgium, said the attackers had also used. Unlike ammonium nitrate, TATP is typically seen in small quantities, not in the tens of pounds. One American official who had reviewed the intelligence related to the bombs in France and the newer intelligence from Belgium said the recovery of more than 30 pounds indicated an increased capacity since the Paris attacks. And that figure did not include any explosive actually used in the bombs that killed 31 people on Tuesday.
0~Philip Johnson, Architecture's Restless Intellect, Dies at 98~Correction Appended Philip Johnson, at once the elder statesman and the enfant terrible of American architecture, died Tuesday at the compound surrounding the Glass House, the celebrated residence he built for himself in New Canaan, Conn. He was 98. His death was disclosed by David Whitney, his companion of 45 years. Often considered the dean of American architects, Mr. Johnson was known less for his individual buildings than for the sheer force of his presence on the architectural scene, which he served as a combination godfather, gadfly, scholar, patron, critic, curator and cheerleader. His 90th birthday, in July 1996, was marked by symposiums, lectures, an outpouring of essays in his honor and back-to-back dinners at two venerable New York institutions he had played a major role in creating: the Museum of Modern Art, whose department of architecture and design he joined in 1930, and the Four Seasons restaurant, which he designed as part of the Seagram Building in 1958. His long career was a study in contradictions. He first became famous as an impassioned advocate of Modern architecture, and his early writings helped establish the reputation of European Modernists like Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius in this country. He began his architectural career as Mies's leading acolyte. But what fascinated him most was the idea of the new, and once he had helped establish Modernist architecture in the United States, he moved on, experimenting with decorative Classicism, embracing the reuse of historical elements that would become known as postmodernism, and finally returning again to Modernism, yet one with an expressive and highly emotional energy. Mr. Johnson's own architecture received mixed reviews and often startled the public and his fellow architects. Because of his frequent changes of style, he was often accused of pandering to fashion and of designing buildings that were facile and shallow. Yet he created several designs, including the Glass House, the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art, and the pre-Columbian gallery at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington that are widely considered among the architectural masterworks of the 20th century. And for his entire career, his engagement with architectural theory and ideas was as deep as that of any scholar.
0~Days of Chaos in Baghdad: Protest or Meltdown?~Why Did the Protest End So Quickly? It was a tactical withdrawal. After they jubilantly occupied Parliament on Saturday afternoon, the demonstrators moved by evening to another area of the Green Zone, a former parade ground where Saddam Hussein held military pageants. By Sunday evening, Mr. Sadr had directed an orderly end to the demonstration, saying he would allow the political class another chance to meet and approve a new cabinet. He also gave notice that he would not hesitate to use his influence among downtrodden Shiites to create havoc in the streets if his grievances were not met with government reforms. _____ What Are the Roots of the Political Conflict? The deadliest fault line in Iraqi society is the divide between the majority Shiite Arabs and the minority Sunni Arabs. This is at the heart of the war between the Iraqi state — supported by the American-led coalition and Iran — and the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State. But the political crisis in Baghdad is largely a struggle among Shiites. The American invasion upended the old order of Sunni dominance — under Mr. Hussein, under the monarchy and under the Ottomans before the founding of modern Iraq at the end of World War I — and for the first time gave the Shiites power. Yet they have never figured out how to overcome their differences and unify Iraq. As Mr. Abadi has pushed to root out corruption, trim government and end sectarian quotas, he has been opposed by other Shiite factions. The protests — both those being led by Mr. Sadr and others that began last summer and at first were largely led by secular Iraqis — also reflect a growing anger over corruption and a failure to provide basic services. _____
0~London A.I. Lab Claims Breakthrough That Could Accelerate Drug Discovery~Some scientists spend their lives trying to pinpoint the shape of tiny proteins in the human body. Proteins are the microscopic mechanisms that drive the behavior of viruses, bacteria, the human body and all living things. They begin as strings of chemical compounds, before twisting and folding into three-dimensional shapes that define what they can do — and what they cannot. For biologists, identifying the precise shape of a protein often requires months, years or even decades of experimentation. It requires skill, intelligence and more than a little elbow grease. Sometimes they never succeed. Now, an artificial intelligence lab in London has built a computer system that can do the job in a few hours — perhaps even a few minutes. DeepMind, a lab owned by the same parent company as Google, said on Monday that its system, called AlphaFold, had solved what is known as “the protein folding problem.” Given the string of amino acids that make up a protein, the system can rapidly and reliably predict its three-dimensional shape.
0~New Clashes in Chinese City Shed Strong Light on Ethnic Divide~URUMQI, China  Some women glared through their black veils at the paramilitary troops encircling them. Others held identity cards of missing relatives in the air. Fists raised, tears in their eyes, they demanded the release of sons and husbands seized by the police after Muslim Uighurs rioted in this western regional capital days earlier. And as the group of several hundred Uighur women beseeched journalists on a government-sponsored tour here on Tuesday, they gave voice to broader concerns at the heart of the deadliest ethnic violence to strike China in decades. “They don’t respect our lifestyle,” said one woman, a 26-year-old who gave her name as Guli. “We want our dignity. We just want fairness, and we want equality.” A wide variety of government policies here in the western desert region of Xinjiang, a lightly populated area that covers about a sixth of China’s total landmass, has for years led many of the area’s 10 million Uighurs to believe their culture and livelihoods were under assault by the Han Chinese, the dominant ethnic group in China, according to local residents, foreign scholars and recent studies of the area.
0~India’s Restaurants Rebel Against Food Delivery Apps~Another sore point is customer data. Neither Zomato nor Swiggy shares customers’ names and phone numbers with the restaurant that fills the order, citing privacy concerns. Restaurant owners said that left them with no way to market directly or build long-term relationships with their best customers. Zomato and Swiggy also keep cooking up promotions and programs to provide value to app users — often at the expense of the restaurants. Zomato recently enrolled about 250 restaurants in an experiment called Infinity, in which people could eat as much as they wanted from a restaurant’s entire menu for a flat price. The ensuing gluttony was difficult for restaurants to manage and resulted in a lot of wasted food. Mr. Goyal said Zomato now planned to limit the unlimited dining to selected items like pancakes or dosas. Swiggy, which is focused entirely on delivery, is beginning to compete directly with restaurant partners through its own brands, which make food in special, delivery-only “cloud kitchens.” The restaurant industry has asked India’s antitrust regulators to block the in-house brands. Swiggy declined to comment on the matter. The frustrations came to a head on Aug. 13, just before India’s Independence Day. About 300 restaurant owners in Gurugram, a New Delhi suburb that is home to many tech companies, including Zomato, decided they were tired of losing money to patrons of Zomato Gold. They made a pact to pull out of Gold and other discount programs for a few days, saying that they wanted to “detox consumers from discount addiction.” News of the protest went viral. Within days, more than 2,000 restaurants — from white-tablecloth establishments to neighborhood dosa shops — joined in. This week, the industry called for additional changes to the food delivery programs operated by the major players, including Uber Eats.
0~Where Europe Went Wrong in Its Vaccine Rollout, and Why~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Europe’s vaccination process was expected to be well-orchestrated and efficient. So far, it’s been neither. Sabrina Tavernise spoke with our colleague Matina Stevis-Gridneff about what’s behind Europe’s problems and why they may get worse before they get better. It’s Monday, April 12. sabrina tavernise Matina, help us understand what’s happening right now in the E.U. with the coronavirus and vaccines because from the outside, it looks like a mess. matina stevis-gridneff Unfortunately, Sabrina, it looks like a mess from the inside as well. archived recording 1 The World Health Organization warned this week there are more Covid deaths in Europe now than in March of last year. matina stevis-gridneff We’re in the middle of a third wave here in Europe. archived recording 1 The highest per capita death rate is in Hungary. archived recording 2 In Germany, they are seeing the numbers of infections rising. archived recording 3 France has the fastest growing infection rate in Europe. matina stevis-gridneff More than half of the E.U. 27 member states have growing caseloads of Covid. That’s, of course, down to those really infectious variants. archived recording 1 Politicians responding with lockdowns. archived recording 2 New regulations in Poland, Ukraine and France. matina stevis-gridneff But another piece of this worsening picture for Europe — archived recording It’s been a scandal throughout the continent. matina stevis-gridneff — is the ultra slow pace of rolling out the vaccine. archived recording The World Health Organization has criticized the speed of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout in Europe saying that it is, quote, unacceptably slow. matina stevis-gridneff And just to give you a sense of what we mean by slow pace, about 62 percent of Israelis have received at least one dose of a vaccine. That’s maybe 47 percent of British people, a third of Americans. That percentage for E.U, nationals is just 13.5 And while that may be much higher than your average global citizen, it’s still very, very low for Europeans. sabrina tavernise And so what is the situation with the vaccine rollout? Why has it been so slow? matina stevis-gridneff It’s not the sort of question that lends itself to a simple answer. But if you remember at the beginning of the crisis, this is February, March last year, when the pandemic hit Italy really, really hard, countries like Germany and France that had production and stockpiles of personal protective equipment, like masks, decided to actually hoard them and stop them from getting exported to Italy that desperately needed them at the time. And that was so ugly to see. It was like, you know, Texas is sitting on loads of masks that it’s not using and is not giving them to the state next door. It really was an existential problem at the heart of the E.U. And coming out of that first shock, and kind of regaining confidence, the E.U. decided we cannot have that happen again with vaccines. We can’t have E.U. member states competing against each other to buy vaccines, and in a place that’s so integrated as Europe, where borders are basically open. Cross-border trade is constant. People travel all the time. It doesn’t really make sense for one country to be vaccinated and the other not to be. And so that’s why the European Union became the leader in procuring and negotiating those vaccines on behalf of its 27 members. sabrina tavernise So Matina, the idea is almost that the E.U. is kind of functioning as its own country, right? And by negotiating as one body, it will do a better job at fairly distributing vaccines in an orderly way. matina stevis-gridneff Absolutely, and that it will also get better terms for these negotiations. It will get a better price. It will get a better schedule of deliveries. But there were fundamental problems from the outset. The one is that these efforts on E.U. level started multiple weeks behind similar efforts in the United States and in the U.K. and some other countries around the world. And as we now know so painfully, there’s only a few vaccines to go around. So when you’re joining second, third or fourth in that race, you’re going to be potentially seeing some problems down the road. The other problem is that while the European Union shares policy on a bunch of issues, mostly economic related, it does not have much of a track record in health issues. E.U. guys can tell you how to do trade deals, and they can tell you how to deal with tech regulation. They don’t have much of a track record in sitting down with big pharma and negotiating vaccine supply. sabrina tavernise And so what ends up happening when they start negotiating for vaccines? matina stevis-gridneff Well, to put it sort of simply, they go into this process, which is quite complicated as shoppers or consumers, rather than partners of the pharmaceutical companies. They have assumed that the free market is going to work perfectly in the global vaccine race, and they put a lot of trust in these companies. They seal deals and sign contracts with pharmaceutical companies for more than a billion doses — enough to inoculate the population multiple times over. They don’t suspect that anyone else is getting better contracts, better terms than they are. And so they feel that they’ve actually done a pretty good job. It turns out, however, that’s not exactly the case. Looking over the Atlantic for example, in the United States, Operation Warp Speed is actually going into the vaccine development and procurement process as a partner, throwing billions at it for research and development, where the E.U. is investing much smaller figures. sabrina tavernise Got it. So essentially, the U.S. is just throwing money at this problem, and the E.U. is acting more as kind of responsible stewards of taxpayer money, more kind of like a shopper, a consumer shopping for prices comparing. matina stevis-gridneff Exactly. And that decision and that approach comes back to haunt them. sabrina tavernise What do you mean? matina stevis-gridneff Well, at first, they negotiate and sign deals with multiple pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer and Moderna and CureVac and Johnson & Johnson for hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines that haven’t even been discovered yet. But they really place a deal with this British Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca at the heart of their future vaccination campaign. The reason for that is it looks like AstraZeneca might end up being the first developing a successful vaccine. So in August, they signed an agreement for 400 million doses. And the additional benefit is AstraZeneca has said they will sell its vaccines at cost for quite an extended period of time. So this really looks like an attractive option. But when late January comes around, and AstraZeneca does have a viable vaccine and gets authorized in the European Union, the company suddenly informs the E.U. that it’s not going to be able to ship them 100 million or more vaccine doses like it had promised in the contract, because of some production problems and is actually only going to be able to supply them with 30 million doses. sabrina tavernise Whoa, that is a huge difference, Matina. matina stevis-gridneff It is. It’s huge. It appends plans for the vaccine rollouts in the European Union. And what sort of adds insults to injury is that looking across the English Channel to Britain, which remember, has just left the European Union and has decided to go it alone, AstraZeneca seems to be supplying vaccines without any hiccups or any problems whatsoever. And that country is just going from strength to strength in its vaccine rollout. sabrina tavernise Why is the U.K. getting all this supply while the E.U. is just getting this tiny fraction? matina stevis-gridneff Sabrina, to answer your question, you’re probably going to have to wait four years until the E.U. AstraZeneca legal battle plays out. But we do have some hints as to what’s happened. First of all, AstraZeneca itself has said that we did our contract with Britain well before the European contract. The E.U. retorts that, well, there was never some kind of first-come-first-served clause in our contract. So we just assumed you would continue serving us and all your other customers around the world, the U.K. included, at the same time. But another issue seems to be a little more complicated. It seems that the U.K., and actually the United States as well, did quite clearly stipulate in their contracts with the same companies that doses produced domestically had to first go to serving domestic supply. And what that ends up looking like, Sabrina, is that virtually no doses have been exported from the United States or the United Kingdom. But it’s become clear now that the E.U. did not limit pharmaceutical companies from exporting vaccines produced in the E.U. to other countries. And pretty much half of the doses produced in E.U. factories have been exported for use outside the European Union. sabrina tavernise Wow. So the E.U. essentially did a really bad job in protecting itself in the case of a supply shortage. I mean, it sounds like the way the E.U. went about it just really backfired. matina stevis-gridneff That’s exactly right, and I think that goes to the heart of the issues we were talking about, which have to do with expertise and savvy going into those negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. The E.U. is a global champion of free trade. It didn’t come naturally to them to tell private companies that they can’t export vaccines produced in the E.U. And it definitely backfired. sabrina tavernise So Matina, there’s this feuding going on in Brussels between E.U. leaders and AstraZeneca. But what’s actually happening on the ground in European countries? matina stevis-gridneff Sabrina, people are really angry. They’re seeing across the channel British people getting vaccinated faster than them. They’re blaming the European Union for supply failures. They’re angry with AstraZeneca, a third wave has arrived on the continent. And on top of all that, their own governments, which are actually responsible for getting the vaccines to them are failing in slightly absurd ways for the developed world. Like in parts of Germany, you can only make an appointment to get vaccinated over the phone, and people need to call 150 times. So the anger is really, really growing as we go through February and March. And when you couldn’t really think of ways that things could get worse, they do. sabrina tavernise So Matina, you said things were just about to get worse. What did you mean? matina stevis-gridneff Well, in early March, we start hearing about some extremely rare, very unusual blood clotting incidents in Europe. archived recording There might be a connection between the AstraZeneca vaccine and cerebral thrombosis. matina stevis-gridneff That occur and people who have recently received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. archived recording The cases are so severe, including fatalities, that it wouldn’t be responsible to keep vaccinating without re-evaluation. matina stevis-gridneff And some of those events are fatal. They’re very, very, very few. We’re talking about fewer than 20 deaths. And that’s in the millions and millions of doses that have been distributed. So statistically, this is a tiny figure. archived recording The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, one of the most widely used Covid-19 vaccines in the world, has been suspended in three European countries. matina stevis-gridneff But the concern is such that several European regulatory authorities decide to suspend using the vaccine altogether and ask the E.U. regulator to look into these incidents and try and determine what’s going on. sabrina tavernise I mean, that’s a really, really small number of people out of millions. Did it seem like the response that the E.U. had given was overblown? matina stevis-gridneff Well, actually, the European Union regulator deliberates — archived recording Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam to this virtual press briefing. matina stevis-gridneff — and offers its first opinion a few weeks into March and says — archived recording The committee has come to a clear scientific conclusion. This is a safe and effective vaccine. matina stevis-gridneff We don’t think there is anything really wrong here. archived recording Its benefits in protecting people from Covid-19 with the associated risks of death and hospitalization outweigh the possible risks. matina stevis-gridneff We’re going to keep looking into this, but you should all go back to fully using the AstraZeneca vaccine. It’s efficient, it’s effective, it works and it’s safe. And so those countries that out of an abundance of caution had suspended the vaccine start using it again. But the damage has already been done. People start really not trusting the AstraZeneca vaccine in significant numbers. The combination of concerns over whether it’s causing blood clots, the fighting over its supply, the politics around the vaccine. It’s in the news daily. Europeans are just skeptical about taking it. And then — archived recording The PRAC, after a very in-depth analysis, has concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine. matina stevis-gridneff Just in the most recent days, the regulator comes back and says, OK, there is a possible link between the vaccine and those clotting incidents. We still believe that the benefits of this vaccine outweigh the risks, and we’re not going to recommend suspending it. But that is exactly what some countries choose to do. And it is chaos. Across Europe, different countries start putting in different rules within 24 hours. Italy says it will stop giving it to people under the age of 60 because the evidence shows that these ultra rare blood clots are occurring in younger ages. For other E.U. countries, the age limit is 55. In the U.K., the authorities say, no, we will continue offering it, but we will offer an alternative option to people under the age of 30. So it becomes an incredibly messy and complex picture in terms of who’s using the AstraZeneca vaccine and for what part of the population that has just compounded what was already a very, very messy difficult picture of suspicion toward the vaccine. sabrina tavernise So Matina, where does all this leave us? What does it mean for the E.U.‘s vaccination efforts right now? matina stevis-gridneff By some measures, we’re in a much better place than we have been in the last few months, partly because the last few months have been a total disaster. So there is some optimism in the E.U. about supply, for example. They’re expecting 300 to 360 million doses of vaccines. That is a big improvement to the first quarter of the year, where they received under 100 million doses. That being said, they’re still very much behind the U.S. and the U.K. And just to give you a general sense of their goals, which they believe are realistic, the E.U. hopes to vaccinate about 70 percent of its adult population fully by September, and that’s roughly what we would define colloquially as herd immunity. sabrina tavernise So Matina, considering everything we know now, that timing doesn’t sound that bad. It doesn’t sound that far behind the U.S. actually. matina stevis-gridneff I mean, you’re right in that it’s probably eight, maybe 10 weeks behind. But oh, those eight weeks are going to be so important for the E.U.. Eight weeks is a long time in politics, and a lot of E.U. leaders are facing tremendous pressures at home. We’ve already had one prime minister in Slovakia who’s resigned over vaccine related problems. There are governments and their futures and fates hanging on those eight weeks, and those eight weeks also include the all important European summer. sabrina tavernise What do you mean by the all important European summer? matina stevis-gridneff Well, the summer in Europe is something of a mythical thing. It’s very important for several economies in the E.U., especially those sun-soaked, azure water, southern countries like Greece and Italy and Spain and Croatia. Their economies, their employment really depend on tourist arrivals, and they’ve already lost one summer season. Some of these countries would face really, really serious problems if they completely lost another summer season because of slow vaccination process. sabrina tavernise So Matina, I think of this kind of big global crisis as exactly the kind of thing the E.U. was set up to handle. So at this moment, if you’re Germany and if you’re France, if you’re a wealthy member country, does it give you pause about the whole purpose of the European Union? matina stevis-gridneff Well, let me put it this way, euroskepticism and concerns around membership in the European Union were certainly given a face and a voice during Brexit with the U.K. leaving. And small contingents of euroscepticism exist in every single E.U. country for totally different reasons in each one. I don’t think that the balance will shift in any E.U. country against the E.U. because of the handling of the coronavirus crisis overall, or because of what’s happened with vaccines. sabrina tavernise Why not? matina stevis-gridneff Well, because of the 27 E.U. member states the majority are a lot smaller and poorer than Germany and France. And many of them, most of them probably would actually not even have vaccines right now if they had had to negotiate access to them on their own. And so bottom line is doing it collectively may have served the majority quite well. I think that maybe Germans and French people and Italians maybe sacrificed speed to go it together. But ultimately, they also benefit hugely from going it together. Take the example of Germany, which probably is the country that most credibly could have done much better on its own. Germany has nine borders with other E.U. countries. It exports to all of these countries. The region is effectively fully integrated. In order to maintain reaping those huge financial benefits, you sort of need to have accomplished a comparable level of vaccination and immunity. And the only way to that end goal was to go it together, which is why Germany agreed to do so in the first place. sabrina tavernise So Matina, ultimately while the vaccine campaign was bungled, you don’t really come away from this with the feeling that what has happened poses any kind of existential threat to the E.U. matina stevis-gridneff I mean, Sabrina, I hesitate to make predictions given how everything that could go wrong has gone wrong seemingly so far. But overall, I think that the E.U. takes some lessons away and as it has done in the past, grows through crisis. It’s what it does best. Fundamentally, the E.U. and its 450 million citizens have enjoyed much faster access to vaccines than the vast majority of the world’s population. They’re well on their way to resuming a normal social or semi normal social and economic life, even if that happens a little behind Americans and British people. And so for that, they do have to credit to a certain extent the fact that they didn’t go it alone, and they went to it together. sabrina tavernise Thank you so much, Matina. matina stevis-gridneff Thank you. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. In a major defeat for organized labor, Amazon workers at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama have voted against forming a union there, ending the most significant attempt to organize Amazon workers in the company’s history. The defeat was decisive. The final vote, which was conducted by mail, was 1,798 against the union and 738 for it, meaning that fewer than 30 percent of workers who voted endorsed a union. Organizers had argued that a union was required to combat Amazon’s intense monitoring of workers’ productivity and to negotiate pay that matched the high pressure demands that Amazon places on workers. But in its successful campaign against the union, Amazon emphasized that it pays a minimum wage of $15 an hour, offers health insurance from day one of employment, and is responsive to workers concerns without a union. archived recording No union election in decades has received this much attention. michael barbaro After the vote, union leaders insisted that the fight was not over. archived recording Despite overwhelming odds, workers here at Bessemer have stood up to one of the most powerful companies in the world, to the planet’s richest man, and they were heard. michael barbaro
0~Encuentra algo de felicidad en tus dispositivos con estos ajustes~Los televisores son otro ejemplo. Muchos televisores modernos traen activado un efecto conocido como suavizado (o interpolación) de movimiento (motion smoothing) para hacer que los videos luzcan como si se reprodujeran a más cuadros por segundo, lo que supuestamente hace que las escenas con movimientos muy rápidos se vean más detalladas. Sin embargo, en numerosas ocasiones, en especial cuando estás viendo películas, crea un efecto telenovela que muchos consideran que luce falso. Este el ajuste que muchos amantes de la tecnología desactivan de inmediato en un televisor. Nuestros dispositivos electrónicos están entre las compras más caras de nuestro hogar, así que vale la pena examinar con detenimiento y cambiar los ajustes predeterminados para aprovechar sus beneficios al máximo. A continuación, lo que algunos reporteros de tecnología —yo entre ellos— siempre cambiamos para hacer que nuestros celulares, computadoras y televisores funcionen mejor. Los iPhone de Apple Los iPhone de Apple incluyen varios ajustes que están deshabilitados de fábrica y deben ser activados para que el dispositivo sea más conveniente de usar y tome mejores fotografías. Desbloquea un iPhone con el cubrebocas puesto. Aunque el uso obligatorio de mascarillas ya se ha eliminado en numerosos lugares, muchas personas todavía los usan para sentirse seguras, en especial en interiores. Una de las mayores molestias de usar un iPhone era tener que ingresar un código de desbloqueo, en lugar de usar la identificación facial, cuando usabas una mascarilla. Las versiones recientes del iOS de Apple ahora permiten a los usuarios de iPhone desbloquear el dispositivo sin quitarse el cubrebocas. Ve a Configuración → Face ID y código → Face ID con mascarilla y toca para activarlo (verde). Grabar video 4K. Para hacer que la cámara del iPhone grabe video a su máxima resolución, ve a Configuración → Cámara → Grabar Video y elige una opción 4K. (Yo prefiero “4K a 30 fps” porque funciona bien cuando subes videos a aplicaciones de redes sociales y sitios de internet como YouTube). La desventaja es que las grabaciones en 4K ocuparán más espacio de almacenamiento digital en el iPhone. Sin embargo, si pagaste por esa cámara increíble, ¿por qué no darle un buen uso? Activa la cuadrícula de la cámara. En la fotografía digital, los fotógrafos usan diversas técnicas de composición para hacer las fotos más estéticas. La cámara del iPhone tiene un ajuste para mostrar una retícula que ayuda a componer las tomas. Ve a Configuración → Cámara → Cuadrícula y activa la opción. Celulares Android Los teléfonos Android también incluyen controles que tienen que activarse o modificarse para hacer que la pantalla luzca mejor y el móvil sea más fácil de usar. Cambia el perfil de color de la pantalla . Muchos teléfonos Android vienen con pantallas grandes y brillantes, pero sus colores pueden lucir sobresaturados o demasiado azules. Ryne Hager, un editor del blog de tecnología Android Police, afirma que suele cambiar el perfil de color predeterminado cuando configura un nuevo celular Android. Las instrucciones pueden variar de un modelo a otro. Para los celulares Samsung, ve a Ajustes → Pantalla → Modo de pantalla → Natural . Para móviles Pixel, ve a Ajustes → Pantalla → Colores → Natural . Modifica los atajos. En los móviles Android, puedes personalizar el menú de “Ajustes rápidos” para establecer atajos a funciones que usas a menudo. Desliza hacia abajo desde la parte superior de la pantalla del teléfono inteligente y desliza hacia abajo de nuevo. Si presionas el icono que se ve como un lápiz, puedes elegir agregar mosaicos que te permitan, por ejemplo, activar puntos de acceso o hotspots para compartir la conexión celular del teléfono con una computadora. Activar la cuadrícula de la cámara. De manera similar a los iPhone, algunos móviles Android también pueden mostrar una retícula para facilitar la composición fotográfica. En los celulares Pixel, abre la aplicación de la cámara, desliza hacia abajo desde la parte superior de la pantalla, presiona el icono de engranaje y ve a Tipo de cuadrícula → 3x3. Computadoras Mac En las Mac, donde los usuarios de Apple tienden a hacer su trabajo, es útil configurar los Ajustes para eliminar distracciones y completar más rápido las tareas. Eso implica desactivar algunas funciones que vienen activadas de fábrica y habilitar algunas características ocultas. Activa un atajo para mostrar el escritorio. Minimizar y mover ventanas solo para encontrar un archivo que está en el escritorio puede ser tedioso. La primera cosa que hago con cualquier Mac es activar un atajo que de inmediato oculta todas las ventanas para mostrar el escritorio. Ve a Preferencias de sistema → Mission Control → Mostrar escritorio y elige qué tecla deseas que ejecute el atajo. (Yo uso la tecla “fn” en el teclado de mi MacBook). Apaga las notificaciones para las aplicaciones que te distraen como Mensajes. En una era de videollamadas interminables, definitivamente no es conveniente que los mensajes de texto estén bombardeando tu pantalla y hagan sonidos cuando estás en una reunión. Solo hay que apagar esas notificaciones de manera permanente. Ve a Preferencias de sistema → Notificaciones y enfoque → Mensajes → Permitir notificaciones y desactívala (gris). En este menú, deshabilita las notificaciones de cualquier otra aplicación ruidosa. Agrega el icono de Bluetooth a la barra de menú. La mayoría de nosotros usamos accesorios Bluetooth como audífonos y ratones inalámbricos, así que, para facilitar el conectar y desconectar estos dispositivos en una Mac, es útil tener acceso rápido al menú Bluetooth. Ve a Bluetooth, Preferencias de sistema → Bluetooth → Mostrar Bluetooth en la barra de menú y marca la casilla. Esto mostrará el icono de Bluetooth en la porción superior derecha de la pantalla, donde puedes conectar y desconectar con rapidez auriculares y otros accesorios inalámbricos. Computadoras con Windows Como las Mac, las computadoras con Windows, por defecto, nos lanzan grandes cantidades de notificaciones, pero lo más frustrante son los múltiples pitidos graves y agudos que suenan cuando ocurre algún error. Kimber Streams, que edita en Wirecutter y prueba computadoras portátiles, apaga todos esos molestos sonidos. Apaga las notificaciones. Ve a Ajustes → Sistema → Notificaciones . Quita la marca de todas las casillas y cambia la configuración para desactivar todas las notificaciones. Apaga todos los sonidos de sistema. Ve a Ajustes → Sistema → Sonido → Más ajustes de sonido → Sonidos → Esquema de sonido: sin sonidos y da clic en Aplicar. Televisores Casi todos los televisores vienen con ajustes de fábrica que están lejos del ideal para mostrar la mejor imagen. Con cualquier televisor, vale la pena ajustar los colores, el brillo y el contraste para adaptarlos a tu espacio. No hay un conjunto de pasos universales porque el mejor ajuste diferirá con cada televisor y sala de estar. Sin embargo, existen herramientas útiles de calibración de televisores que pueden facilitar el proceso, incluida mi herramienta favorita, World of Wonder de Disney, un disco Blu-ray con videos instructivos para modificar los ajustes de tu televisor. No obstante, el paso más importante a dar con cualquier televisor es apagar el odioso efecto de suavizado de movimiento. Los pasos varían de un televisor a otro, así que haz una búsqueda en la web para deshabilitarla en tu modelo. En mi televisor LG, fui a Ajustes generales → Imágenes → Ajustes de modo de imagen → Opciones de imagen → TruMotion → Apagado.
0~The Case for a Carbon Tax on Beef~Agriculture, including cattle raising, is our third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, after the energy and industrial sectors. At first glance, the root of the problem may appear to be our appetite for meat generally. Chatham House, the influential British think tank, attributes 14.5 percent of global emissions to livestock — “more than the emissions produced from powering all the world’s road vehicles, trains, ships and airplanes combined.” Livestock consume the yield from a quarter of all cropland worldwide. Add in grazing, and the business of making meat occupies about three-quarters of the agricultural land on the planet. Beef and dairy cattle together account for an outsize share of agriculture and its attendant problems, including almost two-thirds of all livestock emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. That’s partly because there are so many of them — 1 billion to 1.4 billion head of cattle worldwide. They don’t outnumber humanity, but with cattle in this country topping out at about 1,300 pounds apiece, their footprint on the planet easily outweighs ours. The emissions come partly from the fossil fuels used to plant, fertilize and harvest the feed to fatten them up for market. In addition, ruminant digestion causes cattle to belch and otherwise emit huge quantities of methane. A new study in the journal Carbon Balance and Management puts the global gas output of cattle at 120 million tons per year. Methane doesn’t hang around in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide. But in the first 20 years after its release, it’s 80 to 100 times more potent at trapping the heat of the sun and warming the planet. The way feedlots and other producers manage manure also ensures that cattle continue to produce methane long after they have gone to the great steakhouse in the sky. The French researchers, from the Toulouse School of Economics, decided to take a look at a carbon tax on beef because the European Union has committed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions more than half by midcentury — and that includes agricultural emissions. The ambition is to keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, widely regarded as a tipping point at which cascading and potentially catastrophic effects of climate change could sweep across the planet. Their study found that a relatively steep tax, based on greenhouse gas emissions, would raise the retail price of beef by about 40 percent and cause a corresponding drop in consumption, much like the sugar tax on sodas and the tax on tobacco products.
0~Cuomo Adds to His Wish List as State Legislators Seek a Raise~ALBANY — Upsetting the New York State Capitol’s usual rhythms of activity — budget in March, all-nighters in June, indictments almost anytime — the Legislature is contemplating an unusual December special session, with a glittering prize as motivation: a pay raise. A salary increase has long been elusive for lawmakers, and if it is to happen by a Dec. 31 deadline, it may come only after some negotiation with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The governor previously suggested that if lawmakers wanted a raise they should tackle ethics reform. But in recent days, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has amplified his request. If all 213 state lawmakers are to return to Albany this month, he wants them to consider a wider array of policy proposals, including financing for a new hate-crime task force and reforms for the state and New York City university systems. Perhaps even more surprising, Mr. Cuomo’s office requested two amendments to the state’s Constitution that would substantially change the nature of the government in New York by creating a full-time Legislature with four-year terms and setting term limits for officials that hold statewide posts. “It is now up to the Legislature to decide what they want to do,” said Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor.
0~An Update on 4 Students After a College Year~In response to a request from Ron Lieber, the Your Money columnist, asking high school seniors to share their college application essays that covered the subjects of money, class, working or the economy, 66 students last year submitted their work. We picked four to run online. Here’s an update on the students we featured in the column last May. Last year, Shanti Kumar asked in her application essay to Princeton University whether Princeton should be poorer. The university rejected her. Instead, she’s about to finish her first year at Cornell University, which has its own enormous endowment. Should it be poorer, too? On one hand, she points out that its endowment, which is most likely over $6 billion, is larger than the gross national product of some countries. Still, she’s proud to attend a university with a strong program in agricultural and life sciences. “I think Cornell does more for international food security, which is the field I want to work in, than any of the other Ivies,” she said.
0~Murdochs’ TV Deal in Britain Hinges on 3 Words: ‘Fit and Proper’~LONDON — For most of the last 10 years, the Murdoch family, which controls 21st Century Fox, has wanted one thing for its global media empire above all else: the complete ownership of the popular and highly profitable Sky satellite and cable network. Sky is the dominant pay television system here, a hub for Premier League soccer, movies, and networks like Fox News, MTV and Zee Punjabi. It was Rupert Murdoch who founded Sky, and 21st Century Fox already owns part of it. Owning it outright, however, would give the Murdochs an important new cash generator to feed the rapacious appetite for growth and conquest that has made their family business the most influential media conglomerate in the world — one that helped hasten Britain’s “Brexit” from the European Union and helped deliver Donald J. Trump to the White House. But three words threaten to stand in the way: “fit and proper.” “Fit and proper” is that so-perfectly British standard by which regulators here decide whether a company should be allowed to gain and retain broadcast licenses.
0~Una academia mexicana de fútbol cruza la frontera para formar jugadores jóvenes~“Las tres academias empiezan de arriba hacia abajo”, afirmó Ramos. “Pero los clubes pequeños como Xolos Academy pueden intervenir para identificar talento de abajo hacia arriba, desde los 5 y los 6 años de edad, y luego esperar que cuando esos mismos jugadores tengan 10 u 11 años puedan emigrar a academias más grandes que les puedan ofrecer competir a nivel nacional”. Ramos agregó que el problema más grande que enfrentan las tres academias de futbolistas no es tanto el subsidio del entrenamiento para los jugadores que tienen problemas financieros, sino más bien proporcionarle transporte a los deportistas que viven dentro del estado y no pueden pagar viajes de largas distancias para asistir a los entrenamientos y los juegos. “Estas academias no pueden solventar la compra de una camioneta o contratar un autobús para darle servicio a tantos jugadores esparcidos por todo el territorio estatal”, dijo. “Esto hace que sea más importante el trabajo de las academias pequeñas que trabajan con jugadores a un nivel más local”. DiMauro mencionó que los miembros del equipo de entrenadores se organizaron para compartir sus vehículos y llevar a gran parte de los 80 jugadores, de entre 8 y 18 años, a los entrenamientos y los partidos. El club también creó un sitio para entrenar al aire libre en un campo de South River que está más cerca del lugar de residencia de un gran número de jugadores de habla hispana. Uno de esos futbolistas es Xavier Tapia, un defensa de 12 años que pertenece al 80 por ciento de los jugadores de habla hispana que provienen de una decena de países de América Latina y forman parte del programa de los Xolos de Nueva Jersey (el resto de los jugadores son blancos y suelen ser residentes de clase media de las ciudades y pueblos de los alrededores). Hace poco, antes de un entrenamiento matutino, Tapia señaló hacia arriba, en dirección a dos afiches que se encontraban en un muro de las instalaciones, donde se ve a Moreno en acción. “Mi sueño es ser profesional como él”, dijo Tapia. Moreno regresó a casa el mes pasado para visitar a su familia y amigos después de que el Tijuana fue eliminado de la liguilla (la fase final de liga del fútbol mexicano). Hizo una parada en el centro de entrenamiento de los Xolos y saludó a DiMauro y a su hijo, Phil, un entrenador que ayuda a su padre con el manejo de la academia.
0~College Admission Is Not a Personality Contest. Or Is It?~In the analysis of student records filed by a group representing Asian-American students in a lawsuit against Harvard, admissions officers discussed traits that included “positive personality,” kindness, courage and being “widely respected.” In a study of 10 unidentified schools commissioned by the College Board, traits included “emotional intelligence,” “self-efficacy” and creativity. Leadership, education experts said, is perhaps the most obvious and the most common trait colleges consider in applicants. How do colleges choose which traits they value? Colleges don’t like to talk about this much, and officials don’t like to be pinned down. In general, they say they look for traits that reflect the college’s values or that make a student a “good fit” for the institution. Of the 10 colleges included in the College Board study, only one has performed any study on whether the use of criteria can help predict a student’s success, said Don Hossler, a senior scholar at the Center for Enrollment Research, Policy, and Practice at the University of Southern California. Colleges take it as a sign that their criteria work so long as their retention rates are good. But even subtle differences in criteria may reveal something about a college’s values, or at least those of its admissions dean. Maria Laskaris, the admissions dean at Dartmouth College from 2007 to 2015, said she directed her staff to consider “empathy” rather than “kindness.” “It’s a broader term,” she said. “And it speaks to what you want students to learn from each other.” How can admissions officers be objective about a trait like “empathy”? They really can’t, experts acknowledged, a fact that the lawsuit against Harvard claims has disadvantaged Asian-American applicants. Such evaluations are an exercise in “trying to be objectively subjective,” as Dr. Hossler put it. Colleges say they try to ward against bias by ensuring that applications are considered by more than one person. Often those that reach the final stages are debated in a group.
0~Tornadoes Ravage the South; Toll Nears 300~TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — A day after enduring a terrifying bombardment of storms that killed hundreds across the South and spawned tornadoes that razed neighborhoods and even entire towns, people from Texas to Virginia to Georgia searched through rubble for survivors on Thursday and tried to reclaim their own lives. At least 285 people across six states died in the storms, with more than half — 195 people — in Alabama. This college town, the home of the University of Alabama, has in some places been shorn to the slab, and accounts for at least 36 of those deaths. Thousands have been injured, and untold more have been left homeless, hauling their belongings in garbage bags or rooting through disgorged piles of wood and siding to find anything salvageable. While Alabama was hit the hardest, the storm spared few states across the South. Thirty-four people were reported dead in Tennessee, 33 in Mississippi, 15 in Georgia, 7 in Virginia and one in Kentucky. With search and rescue crews still climbing through debris and making their way down tree-strewn country roads, the toll is expected to rise.
0~Uniper, Germany’s Largest Gas Importer, Asks for Government Bailout~As Europe’s energy crisis escalates, Uniper, Germany’s largest importer of natural gas, asked the government for help on Friday, hours after Parliament passed a law aimed at keeping the energy provider afloat. The company’s finances have been hit hard by cutbacks of Russian gas. Most recently, Gazprom, the state-controlled giant in Russia, has pared back supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany. Uniper, which functions as a kind of middleman between Gazprom and German factories and municipalities, is being forced to make up shortfalls of Russian fuel ordered on long-term contracts by buying more expensive supplies, like liquefied natural gas. But for now, the company is largely unable to pass those higher costs on to its customers. Uniper is absorbing “the lion’s share of the costs emanating from these curtailments and thereby has ended up in a very precarious situation,” Klaus-Dieter Maubach, the chief executive, said on Friday during a news conference.
0~Biden is Combating Ransomware with Crackdown on Cryptocurrency Payments~“I don’t understand how I got mixed up in this,” he said in a brief interview. Suex, which is registered in the Czech Republic, was mostly a failure and had conducted only a half dozen or so transactions since 2019, Mr. Zhabykin said, adding that he had three employees. Russia is believed to be home to the most sophisticated ransomware groups, where they seem to operate with impunity. Other countries such as Iran and North Korea host the groups, cybersecurity experts say. Over the past decade or so, key technologies came together in a tool kit for the ransomware industry: malware to scramble victims’ computers, routers that render communication anonymous and digital currencies for payments. A weak point, according to a study of ransomware published in 2019 in The Journal of Cybersecurity, is exchanges: the businesses that convert digital currency into cash, where criminals lurking in the digital world eventually have to make an appearance to be paid. Many exchanges have popped up in Russia in recent years, often leasing office space in Moscow’s financial district alongside banks. Russia pivoted from trying to ban digital currencies outright to enacting regulation this year allowing ownership. The Treasury Department’s action came three months after President Biden, meeting in Geneva with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, demanded a crackdown on ransomware operators suspected of working from Russian territory. Mr. Putin made no promises. Before the meeting, one attack had taken out Colonial Pipeline, which provides much of the East Coast’s gasoline and jet fuel; another had penetrated JBS, a major U.S. meat supplier. Attacks seemed to abate for a few months, and a major ransomware operator, DarkSide, appeared to have shut down.
0~Trump Administration Escalates Global Fight Over Taxing Tech~WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Tuesday that it would open an investigation into taxes on digital commerce that have been adopted or proposed in nine countries and the European Union, escalating a global battle that will affect where big American tech companies like Facebook and Amazon pay taxes. The administration’s move could ultimately lead to American tariffs on imports from Brazil, Britain, India and a host of other countries, heightening the chances of another global trade dispute that results in retaliatory taxes on U.S. goods. The investigation, which will be conducted by the United States Trade Representative, could also complicate global negotiations that have been underway for more than a year and are aimed at reaching a multinational consensus on how to tax internet commerce that crosses borders. At issue are efforts spreading across Europe and beyond to impose so-called digital services taxes on economic activity generated online. Those taxes deviate from many traditional international tax regimes by affecting revenues earned by a company where they are generated — regardless of whether the company has a physical presence there. For example, India imposed a 2 percent tax in April on online sales of goods and services to people in India by large foreign firms. The European Union has revived its push for a similar tax as a way to help fund response measures to the coronavirus.

0~Al Jazeera Journalist Is Killed in West Bank~JERUSALEM — A journalist for Al Jazeera was fatally shot in the West Bank city of Jenin early Wednesday, the news network and the Palestinian Health Ministry said, blaming Israeli forces for her death. The circumstances surrounding the shooting of the journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian American, were not immediately clear, but she was shot as clashes between the Israeli military and Palestinian gunmen took place in the city. Al Jazeera, citing the Health Ministry, said the journalist had been shot in the head by Israeli forces during a raid. A second journalist was hospitalized after being hit in the back, the ministry said. “Al Jazeera holds the Israeli government and the occupation forces responsible for the killing of Shireen,” the news network said in a statement. “It also calls on the international community to condemn and hold the Israeli occupation forces accountable.”

0~C.I.A. Drones Kill Civilians in Pakistan~ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Several missiles fired from American drone aircraft on Thursday struck a meeting of local people in northwest Pakistan who had gathered with Taliban mediators to settle a dispute over a chromite mine. The attack, a Pakistani intelligence official said, killed 26 of 32 people present, some of them Taliban fighters, but the majority elders and local people not attached to the militants. The civilian death toll appeared to be among the worst in the scores of strikes carried out recently in Pakistan’s tribal areas by the C.I.A., which runs the drones. Local residents and media reports said as many as 40 people had been killed in all, though the intelligence official disputed that. The Pakistani military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, issued an unusual and unusually strong condemnation of the attack. “It is highly regrettable that a jirga of peaceful citizens, including elders of the area, was carelessly and callously targeted with complete disregard to human life,” the statement said. But American officials on Thursday sharply disputed Pakistan’s account of the strikes and the civilian deaths, contending that all the people killed were insurgents. “These people weren’t gathering for a bake sale,” an American official said. “They were terrorists.”
0~Germany Says It’s Broken Up a Far-Right Terrorism Network~BERLIN — Twelve men — one a police employee — were arrested Friday on charges of forming and supporting a far-right terrorism network planning wide-ranging attacks on politicians, asylum seekers and Muslims, the authorities said. The arrests come as Germany confronts both an increase in violence and an infiltration of its security services by far-right extremists. After focusing for years on the risks from Islamic extremists and foreign groups, officials are recalibrating their counterterrorism strategy to address threats from within. The arrests are the latest in a series of episodes that Christine Lambrecht, the justice minister, called a “very worrying right-wing extremist and right-wing terrorist threat in our country.” [Read: Following latest attack, Germans are told far-right terrorism is the number one threat.] “We need to be particularly vigilant and act decisively against this threat,” she said on Twitter.

0~Apple’s App Store Draws Antitrust Scrutiny in European Union~American investigations of Big Tech’s power, including those by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, have tended to lump Apple in with Google, Facebook and Amazon. But Apple was thought to be at the least risk of punishment there because its business practices appeared to be less problematic than its closest peers. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. But now Europe’s formal investigations show Apple still faces at least one big regulatory fight. In Europe, the world’s largest technology companies have long been viewed with suspicion as they have consolidated power over the digital economy. In 2016, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes from Apple, worth about $14.7 billion today. The antitrust authorities have also issued billions of dollars in fines against Google for antitrust violations in recent years, while Amazon and Facebook are also facing fresh scrutiny. Spotify has been discussing Apple’s practices with European regulators for about five years, according to a person involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were private. Tuesday’s announcement is a major milestone, yet the commission could still spend a year or more investigating the company’s practices before determining whether to bring charges. Since Spotify made its formal complaint in Europe in March 2019, regulators have been considering how to show harm from Apple’s actions, according to the person involved. They eventually concluded that Apple’s 30 percent share of some revenues collected via the App Store raised competitors’ costs, eventually leading to higher prices for consumers, this person said. Spotify said it had raised its monthly subscription price to $13 from $10 in 2014 to make up for Apple’s cut. A year later, Apple introduced its streaming-music competitor, Apple Music, priced at $10 a month. Spotify then decided to pull out of the App Store payment system, restricting Apple from taking a share and prompting Spotify to drop its price back to $10 a month. It then became more complicated to sign up for Spotify’s paid service; customers now have to go to a website instead of simply tapping a button in the app. Apple has faced other scrutiny of how it uses its influence over the App Store. For years it has packed the top of many App Store search results with its own apps, even when they were less popular or relevant than competitors’ offerings, according to an investigation by The New York Times. In 2018, Apple also began restricting or removing many popular apps that helped people limit the time they and their children spent on their iPhones, just after Apple released competing tools. After the makers of two parental-control apps complained to European regulators and The Times reported on Apple’s moves, Apple quietly reversed its policy and let the apps back into the App Store. In addition to App Store policies, European authorities are investigating Apple Pay, which allows people to make purchases within apps or in shops with an iPhone or Apple Watch. The questions surround requirements companies must agree to when integrating Apple Pay into apps or websites. The commission said it would review how the company controlled access to “tap and go” technology for rival payment systems on Apple devices.
0~Bruno Latour, 75, Philosopher on the Social Basis of Scientific Facts, Dies~Many people interpreted Dr. Latour’s position as relativist — as asserting that there was no such thing as objective truth. At times his statements came across to some as comical, like his remark in a 1988 essay that the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II could not have died of tuberculosis because the bacteria was only discovered in 1882. “Some of the critique was indeed ridiculous,” he said in an interview with Science magazine in 2017. “I certainly was not anti-science, although I must admit it felt good to put scientists down a little. There was some juvenile enthusiasm in my style.” Dr. Latour was a prime target during the so-called science wars of the 1990s, which pitted traditional, positivist thinkers against social constructionists like himself. Alan Sokal, a mathematician at New York University and a leading positivist, once invited those who, like Dr. Latour, believed that “the laws of physics are mere social conventions” to leap from Dr. Sokal’s 21st-floor apartment to test whether gravity was real or just a social construct. Dr. Latour declined, but also insisted that Dr. Sokal and others were missing his point. In fact, he said, he was very much pro-science, and felt that he was doing it a favor by demystifying its means of intellectual production — the better to demonstrate to skeptics the extensive work that goes into it. “I think we were so happy to develop all this critique because we were so sure of the authority of science,” Dr. Latour told The New York Times Magazine in a profile of him in 2018. “And that the authority of science would be shared because there was a common world.” To the surprise of many of his erstwhile combatants, during the last 20 years, Dr. Latour became an ally and defender of the research establishment in the face of anti-science attacks from corporate and conservative interests. Beginning with a 2004 article in the journal Critical Inquiry, he raised the concern that the critical methods and perspectives that he and other philosophers had applied to truth claims in the 1980s and ’90s had been hijacked and perverted by climate change deniers and conspiracy theorists.
0~From Red Lobster to Running Some of New York’s Marquee Restaurants~Anyone who witnessed the rise of fine dining in New York City during the 1980s and ’90s would hardly have bet that Danny Meyer — whose personal touch, food sensibility and laser focus on hospitality has influenced a generation of American restaurants — would pick a Red Lobster executive to replace him as the head of his restaurant group. Chip Wade, 59, formerly in charge of 704 Red Lobster restaurants in North America, is the new chief executive officer of the Union Square Hospitality Group, which started in 1985 when Mr. Meyer, a 27-year-old Midwesterner with a political science degree, opened Union Square Cafe in what was then an unlikely neighborhood for high-end dining. The company grew to include 12 restaurants, a catering arm and a collection of all-day cafes called Daily Provisions, and spawned the fast-food giant Shake Shack, now worth more than $3 billion. Putting someone else in charge was no small move for Mr. Meyer, who has a hand in every part of his company, down to how bacon should look on a sandwich.
0~Democrats Aim for Climate Provisions Biden Can Promote at U.N. Summit~Democrats are still searching for ways to strengthen the climate provisions in President Biden’s environmental and social policy bill just days before he is set to appear at a United Nations climate summit that begins on Sunday in Glasgow, and some lawmakers say they have not given up the push to include a tax on planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution. The White House is urging lawmakers to agree on a framework for the legislation before the president meets other world leaders at the summit. Mr. Biden hopes to point to the bill as evidence that he will be able to meet his ambitious promise that the United States will cut its planet-warming pollution 50 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. As it stands now, passage of the bill, which is expected to include roughly $500 billion in spending on climate and environmental provisions, would get the United States up to half the way toward that target, according to an analysis by Rhodium Group, an independent policy research firm. The package is set to include about $300 billion in tax incentives to promote renewable energy and electric vehicles. Until recently, Mr. Biden had hoped that it would also include a $150 billion program to pay electric utilities to close fossil fuel-fired power plants and replace them with wind and solar generators, and to penalize those that do not do so. The combination of that program and the tax credits would have allowed Mr. Biden to credibly claim in Glasgow that the United States was on track to meet its climate targets.
0~A Woman on the $10 Bill, and Everyone Has 2 Cents to Put In~The problem for the critics is not the administration’s idea of choosing a woman — with the exception of a few respondents, like the man who posted on Twitter that he would demand “two fives” if ever handed a $10 note featuring a woman. Rather, the common gripe is that the $20 bill was not chosen instead of the $10 bill for a woman’s portrait. To the bureaucrats, the choice of the 10 was natural and justifiable. For security reasons, the $10 bill was recommended for revision in 2012 by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence committee that is led by Ms. Rios and has representatives from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Secret Service and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. So the $10 note became the vehicle for an administration eager to make a historic statement about women before President Obama leaves office. Despite the complaints, officials say, they cannot switch bills. Yet they might have better anticipated the blowback, critics say. Even before Mr. Lew announced last summer that a woman would be on the $10 bill, a group called Women On 20s inspired Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and others in Congress to introduce legislation calling for a woman’s portrait on the 20. The National Organization for Women got behind the campaign, according to Terry O’Neill, president of the group. Barbara Ortiz Howard, the founder of Women On 20s, was at Mr. Lew’s announcement last June. “They were all excited with their plan, and we had some cautions,” she said. “We thought there might be some issues with it — like the fact that it’s not the 20.” The $20 bill is more numerous by far than the $10 note, and the common currency of the ubiquitous A.T.M. For a woman to be put on the $10 note instead suggests women are of lesser worth, some people complained. Though several of those critics said wryly that the lesser note would aptly symbolize that women still earn less than men on average. The bigger issue, however, turned out to be Hamilton versus Jackson. Many respondents asked: Why displace Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary and the architect of the American financial system, rather than eject Jackson from the $20 bill given his record of violence against Native Americans and opposition to national banking?
0~Brad Parscale Fell From Trump’s Favor. Now He’s Plotting a Comeback.~Brad Parscale was sounding upbeat. He has a new company and, he believes, a brighter future. Mr. Parscale, President Trump’s former campaign manager, said he was trying to move on from that bleak Sunday in late September when he made the national newscasts, after police were called to his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. His wife told officers he was inside the house, ranting, acting erratically, with a loaded and cocked gun. Now he is turning to real estate and plans to buy houses and flip them, he said in an interview this month, something he said he was good at. He is also restarting his political consulting firm, Parscale Strategy, and trying to kick off a start-up called Nucleus, to process and analyze data for conservative politicians. “I spent five years developing the only automated web-based ecosystem that connected all our departments and made our campaign the most efficient in history,” Mr. Parscale said. “And now I want to bring this technology to campaigns all around the world who are right of center.” Once a midlevel marketing executive in San Antonio, Mr. Parscale rose to the president’s inner circle and was hailed, somewhat hyperbolically, as the tech genius whose social media savvy won Mr. Trump the 2016 election. Mr. Parscale became expert in making the Trump campaign messages — sometimes gut-churning and cruel, other times patriotic and nostalgic — go wildly viral, and his dark humor seemed in tune with Mr. Trump and his meme-making fan base.
0~U.S. Economy Cooled as G.D.P. Grew at 2.6% Rate in Fourth Quarter~The American economy slowed at the end of 2018 — and there could be a further slowdown to come. Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United States — grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That marks a significant slowdown from the middle of the year, when a sugar high fueled by tax cuts and government spending increases briefly pushed growth above 4 percent. This year seems to be starting at an even slower pace. Many economists expect growth to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter, in part because of the partial government shutdown, which began in December and extended through most of January. It’s important to keep the cooling economy in perspective. The fourth-quarter slowdown wasn’t as severe as many forecasters had feared, and even with the loss of momentum late in the year, 2018 as a whole was among the best years of the decade-long recovery from the Great Recession. And most economists do not expect a recession this year, putting the current expansion on track to become the longest on record. “I think this is a slowing,” said Lewis Alexander , chief United States economist for Nomura. “I don’t think this is ‘we’re falling into an abyss.’”
0~Trump Abruptly Orders 46 Obama-Era Prosecutors to Resign~“As was the case in prior transitions, many of the United States Attorneys nominated by the previous administration already have left the Department of Justice,” she said in the email. “The Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially appointed U.S. Attorneys to tender their resignations in order to ensure a uniform transition.” The abrupt order came after two weeks of increasing calls from Mr. Trump’s allies outside the government to oust appointees from President Barack Obama’s administration. Mr. Trump has been angered by a series of reports based on leaked information from a sprawling bureaucracy, as well as from his own West Wing. Several officials said the firings had been planned before Friday. But the calls from the acting deputy attorney general arose a day after Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator who is a strong supporter of President Trump, said on his evening show that Mr. Trump needed to “purge” Obama holdovers from the federal government. Mr. Hannity portrayed them as “saboteurs” from the “deep state” who were leaking secrets to hurt Mr. Trump. It also came the same week that government watchdogs wrote to Mr. Bharara and urged him to investigate whether Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from taking payments from foreign governments. In Mr. Hannity’s monologue, he highlighted the fact that the Clinton administration had told all 93 United States attorneys to resign soon after he took office in 1993, and that “nobody blinked an eye,” but he said it became a scandal when the George W. Bush administration fired several top prosecutors midway through his second term. Several Democratic members of Congress said they only heard that the United States attorneys from their states were being immediately let go shortly before the Friday afternoon statement from the Justice Department. One senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect the identity of the United States attorney in that state, said that an Obama-appointed prosecutor had been instructed to vacate the office by the end of the day.
0~Parwan Prison Transferred to Afghans, but Questions Remain~But about 600 newly captured prisoners remain under American control, according to Afghan officials, and there is lasting disagreement over how quickly they should be screened and turned over to Afghan custody. In addition, about 30 of the original prisoners were not handed over to Afghan authority, because of a dispute over whether the Afghans would continue to hold them without trial, as the United States had demanded and as stipulated under the detention deal. As a result of the dispute, Lt. Gen. Keith M. Huber, the American commanding general of the prison, did not attend the transfer ceremony, which featured at least seven generals, two cabinet ministers and other dignitaries from the Afghan side. No one from the American Embassy or the State Department was present. There were reports that General Huber was going to send his deputy, Brig. Gen. VeraLinn Jamieson, but she, too, was a no-show. The only Americans on the dais were the Parwan task force commander, Col. Robert M. Taradash, and his bodyguard. “Today, I affirm that we have fulfilled the agreement,” Colonel Taradash said in a brief speech that drew polite applause. “We transferred more than 3,000 Afghan detainees into your custody” and made sure that those who were still a threat “would not return to the battlefield.” American officials have been concerned that the Afghans would release detainees too readily, turning the prison into a revolving door and speeding captured insurgents back to the battlefield. A joint review board has sorted through their cases, recommending some for prosecution and others for release — reportedly, more than half of those reviewed. During the ceremony on Monday, 15 detainees were freed, without objection from the American side.
0~U.S. Troops to Leave Afghanistan by End of 2016~WASHINGTON — President Obama, declaring that it was “time to turn the page on a decade in which so much of our foreign policy was focused on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,” announced on Tuesday that he planned to withdraw the last American troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. Under a new timetable outlined by Mr. Obama in the Rose Garden, the 32,000 American troops now in Afghanistan would be reduced to 9,800 after this year. That number would be cut in half by the end of 2015, and by the end of 2016, there would be only a vestigial force to protect the embassy in Kabul and to help the Afghans with military purchases and other security matters. At the height of American involvement, in 2011, the United States had 101,000 troops in the country. Mr. Obama said the withdrawal of combat troops from Afghanistan would free up resources to confront an emerging terrorist threat stretching from the Middle East to Africa — a strategy he plans to detail in a commencement address on Wednesday at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.
0~Libya Slides Deeper Into Chaos as Parliament Picks New Government~CAIRO — Libya hurtled deeper into political chaos on Thursday when its Parliament voted to install a new interim government over the objections of the current prime minister. The oil-rich North African nation was already in political limbo after its failure to hold national elections on time in December. The elections were supposed to end more than a decade of instability, which has plagued Libya since an Arab Spring revolt in 2011 overthrew the longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. “We’ll see a feud over who is the legal government,” said Claudia Gazzini, a Libya analyst for the International Crisis Group, “and we’re going to have institutional chaos for some time.” Libya’s Parliament declared that the current government’s authority had expired after the planned elections collapsed without a new political road map. It voted unanimously for Fathi Bashagha, a former interior minister, to lead a new government.
0~Disney Pauses Worker Vaccine Mandate After Florida Ban~Governor DeSantis, also a Republican, has been at the forefront of the political fight to curtail mask and vaccine mandates, saying the push against those restrictions counters overreach from the federal government. “Nobody should lose their job due to heavy-handed Covid mandates, and we had a responsibility to protect the livelihoods of the people of Florida,” the governor said in a statement. The Biden administration has ordered vaccinations for workers in large companies and members of the federal work force, but the effort has met resistance across the country. Florida is among states that have challenged federal mandates in court. The new Florida law prohibits employers from enforcing strict vaccine mandates, allowing employees to choose exemptions that include health or religious concerns, pregnancy or anticipated pregnancy, and having had the virus and recovered from it. Unvaccinated workers could instead undergo periodic testing or wear protective equipment, at the employers’ cost. Fines for violation could cost $10,000 a day per employee violation for businesses with fewer than 99 employees or up to $50,000 per employee violation for larger businesses. Government entities and school districts are also restricted by the Covid mandate ban. Disney World previously struck a deal with employees to require theme park workers to be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus to keep their jobs, and the company defended that rule in a statement Saturday. “We believe that our approach to mandatory vaccines has been the right one as we’ve continued to focus on the safety and well-being of our cast members and guests,” the statement said. More than 90 percent of active cast members in Florida have verified they are vaccinated, the company said, before it sent a memo to employees halting the mandate.
0~Concerns About Coronavirus Variant Cut Off U.K. From Europe~Still, the multiplying problems hammered the stock market and depressed the pound. And there was an unnerving sense that Britain was entering a new, more volatile phase of the pandemic at the very moment that its relationship with its largest trading partner was being thrust into uncharted territory. Political commentators grasped for a precedent for the chaos, with some harkening back to the turbulent events of 1978 and 1979, when nationwide strikes, compounded by harsh winter weather, led to the collapse of the Labour government and the political ascension of Margaret Thatcher. “The government has got to do something to get things under control,” said Jonathan Powell, who served as chief of staff to former Prime Minister Tony Blair when a series of strikes in 2000 caused a politically damaging fuel crisis. “The one thing the public hates is when the government loses control.” The trigger for the current upheaval was Mr. Johnson’s announcement Saturday that he was imposing a strict lockdown on London and the southeast of England, after new data indicated that a viral mutation had turbocharged infection rates in those areas. Scientists who briefed the press Monday estimate the variant is 50 percent to 70 percent more transmissible than the original virus. (Mr. Johnson had earlier said up to 70 percent.) They raised the possibility that children might be more susceptible to it than to the original virus, though that could be affected by Britain’s decision to leave schools open during lockdowns, which means children are mixing more than adults. Mr. Johnson’s move was a reversal from three days earlier, when he promised to honor his vow to ease restrictions for a few days around Christmas so that families could get together. Within hours of the announcement, thousands of people thronged railway stations and airports to try to flee London before the new rules took effect.
0~Fraud Charges Against Jail Officers’ Union Chief With a Taste for Luxury~After the meeting at the hotel, according to prosecutors, Mr. Rechnitz went to Platinum promising to arrange a deal with the union to become a major investor. The catch, he said, was that Mr. Seabrook would have to be compensated. Mr. Huberfeld agreed to the arrangement and was willing to pay Mr. Seabrook 10 percent of all profits that the hedge fund made on the union’s investment. Mr. Seabrook, whose salary is $300,000 a year with his union stipend, had one overarching concern, according to the complaint: how big his cut would be. Mr. Huberfeld told him it could be as much as $150,000 a year. In return, Mr. Seabrook would direct money intended to cover correction officers’ pensions into a high-risk fund. Up to that point the union had maintained a traditional investment portfolio made up of conventional stocks and bond funds, government obligations and a real estate trust fund. The union’s lawyers reviewed the proposal and pointed out that the union had never invested in a hedge fund before, nor had any other New York City retirement fund that they were aware of been involved in such a risky venture. Even so, they did not stand in the way of the deal. “The annuity fund, however, is not averse to being a trendsetter,” the lawyers wrote to Platinum in February 2014. There were other red flags particular to Platinum. Mr. Huberfeld had been convicted of fraud in 1993 for arranging for another person to take a brokerage licensing exam on his behalf. He was fined $5,000 and sentenced to two years of probation. In a separate case, in 1998, he and a partner paid $4.6 million to settle a civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that alleged bank fraud.
0~Why Novak Djokovic Was Disqualified From the U.S. Open~Despite the clarity of the rules, Djokovic pleaded his case for several minutes, saying that the line judge would not need to go to a hospital. Friemel responded to him that the consequences might have been different had the line judge not collapsed to the ground and stayed there for a prolonged time in clear distress. Djokovic also asked Friemel why he could not simply receive a point penalty or game penalty instead of being defaulted. Friemel did not, in fact, have an intermediate option. The code of conduct is an escalating scale in tennis with clearly defined steps: a warning followed by a point penalty followed by a game penalty, followed by a default. But the rules also allow officials the option of proceeding straight to a default after any rule violation if it is deemed sufficiently egregious. As Djokovic had not yet received a warning during the match, Friemel’s only options were to warn him or default him: a part of the rule that Djokovic did not appear to be aware of. But after investigating on court, Friemel did not consider a warning because he concluded that the incident clearly warranted a default. “In the end, in any code violation there is a part of discretion to it, but in this instance, I don’t think there was any chance of any opportunity of any other decision other than defaulting Novak, because the facts were so clear, so obvious,” Friemel said on Sunday night. “The line umpire was clearly hurt and Novak was angry, he hit the ball recklessly, angrily back and taking everything into consideration, there was no discretion involved.” Djokovic had earned $250,000 for reaching the fourth round of the U.S. Open. Here’s a quick look at the various rules at play: Abuse of Balls Players shall not violently, dangerously or with anger hit, kick or throw a tennis ball within the precincts of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match (including warm-up). Violation of this Section shall subject a player to fine up to $20,000 for each violation. In addition, if such violation occurs during a match (including the warmup) the player shall be penalised in accordance with the Point Penalty Schedule hereinafter set forth. For the purposes of this Rule, abuse of balls is defined as intentionally hitting a ball out of the enclosure of the court, hitting a ball dangerously or recklessly within the court or hitting a ball with negligent disregard of the consequences. Unsportsmanlike Conduct Players shall at all times conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner and give due regard to the authority of officials and the rights of opponents, spectators and others. Violation of this Section shall subject a player to a fine up to $20,000 for each violation. In addition, if such violation occurs during a match (including the warmup), the player shall be penalised in accordance with the Point Penalty Schedule hereinafter set forth. In circumstances that are flagrant and particularly injurious to the success of a tournament, or are singularly egregious, a single violation of this Section shall also constitute the Major Offence of “Aggravated Behaviour” and shall be subject to the additional penalties hereinafter set forth. Incidents of tennis players striking officials are rare, but not unprecedented. There were two high-profile incidents of similar defaults in men’s tennis, though none as significant as the disqualification of a top-seeded player at a Grand Slam event.
0~An Inside Look at the Germans’ Deadly Bomber~Awful though it was, some good came of a German air raid on London in July 1917. Twenty-two Gotha bombers had flown in for the attack, but only 19 returned, Prime Minister David Lloyd George told a secret session of the House of Commons a few days later. The incursion had not been made with impunity, he said. Image “A stalwart American fighter now in active service at the American camp ‘somewhere in France.’” (Censors would permit no more specific identification.) Credit... The New York Times Mid-Week Pictorial, Aug. 9, 1917 The downing of the bombers allowed an artist working for The Times Mid-Week Pictorial to render the airplanes’ general structure and arrangements in a cutaway diagram, including the racks and chutes in which 14 60-pound bombs were carried over the target, and the bombardier’s sighting window on the underside of the fuselage. The diagram also showed the biplane’s 260-horsepower Mercedes engines, manufactured by Daimler Motors. (This was the month in which King George V restyled the British royal family as the House of Windsor, and dropped the names Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, for fairly obvious reasons.)
0~Lewd Donald Trump Tape Is a Breaking Point for Many in the G.O.P.~WASHINGTON — Republican leaders began to abandon Donald J. Trump by the dozens on Saturday after the release of a video showing him speaking of women in vulgar sexual terms, delivering a punishing blow to his campaign and plunging the party into crisis a month before the election. Fearing that his candidacy was on the verge of undermining the entire Republican ticket next month, a group of senators and House members withdrew support for him, with some demanding that he step aside. Mr. Trump, however, vowed to stay in the race. The list of party figures publicly rejecting Mr. Trump included a host of prominent elected officials, perhaps most notably Senator John McCain of Arizona, the 2008 nominee. “I thought it important I respect the fact that Donald Trump won a majority of the delegates by the rules our party set,” Mr. McCain said in a statement. “But Donald Trump’s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.”
0~I Used Apple’s New Controls to Limit a Teenager’s iPhone Time (and It Worked!)~Over the last three weeks, I studied Sophie’s phone use patterns along with mine. After determining the apps that we spent extraordinary amounts of time on — Sophie spent hours each day chatting with friends on Snapchat, and I wasted too much of my life reading Twitter — I placed a few time limits on each of us. Here’s how that turned out. During Week 2, when she was trying to withdraw from her phone, strange things started happening to Sophie. After the screenager first used up all her time on Snapchat on a Tuesday, she told her mother that she felt “triggered” (which I would learn is slang for feeling annoyed or incensed). She later told me that she had realized she would open her phone and just stare blankly at the app icons to avoid using up her limit on Snapchat. “It was just a pattern for me — to open my phone and I would have nowhere to go,” she said. “I was just looking at a screen. It was kind of weird, so I’m trying not to do that.” But in the end, the results were satisfying. Sophie’s average daily phone use plummeted by about half, from over six hours during Week 1 to about three hours and four minutes during Week 3. My average phone use decreased 15 minutes a day, to about three and a half hours. I still think we spend too much time on our phones, but Sophie’s progress made this faux parent proud (and ashamed of himself). These early results should be welcome news to people who are growing increasingly concerned about long-term addiction to smartphones. There have been other ways to limit use, including apps like Moment, which have many of the same features as Screen Time. But none of them have been embedded into a phone like Apple’s new software.
0~U.S. Surveillance in Place Since 9/11 Is Sharply Limited~“National security and privacy are not mutually exclusive,” said Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, a freshman who like several other younger Republicans voted against the senior senator from his state. “They can both be accomplished through responsible intelligence gathering and careful respect for the freedoms of law-abiding Americans.” Tuesday’s vote was a rebuke to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, who, until the end in a bitter floor speech, maintained the bill was a dangerous diminishment of national security. Lawmakers in both parties beat back amendments — one by one — that he insisted were necessary to blunt some of the bill’s controls on government spying. Mr. McConnell blasted his fellow senators — and by association Speaker John A. Boehner, who heartily endorsed the measure — as taking “one more tool away from those who defend our country every day.” “This is a significant weakening of the tools that were put in place in the wake of 9/11 to protect the country,” he said. “I think Congress is misreading the public mood if they think Americans are concerned about the privacy implications.” But even scores of senators who loathed the actions of Mr. Snowden voted for the legislation. The legislation’s goals are twofold: to rein in aspects of the government’s data collection authority and to crack open the workings of the secret national security court that oversees it. After six months, the phone companies, not the N.S.A., will hold the bulk phone records — logs of calls placed from one number to another, and the time and the duration of those contacts, but not the content of what was said. A new kind of court order will permit the government to swiftly analyze them. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, for the first time, will be required to declassify some of its most significant decisions, and outside voices will be allowed to argue for privacy rights before the court in certain cases.
0~Wawrinka Blossoms While Federer, His Friend and Countryman, Falters~MiniPeople.ch, a comic strip spoofing Swiss celebrities, on Wednesday showed a caped superhero, with “RF” on his chest, fleeing New York. In the final panel, he was replaced by a new hero: Iron Stan. “Stan” referred to ninth-seeded Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who will face third-seeded Andy Murray, the defending champion, in the United States Open quarterfinals Thursday afternoon. “RF” was Roger Federer, the 17-time Grand Slam winner, who meekly exited the tournament Monday in the fourth round, falling in straight sets to Tommy Robredo. For the first time in Wawrinka’s 35 career Grand Slam appearances, he has advanced further in the draw than his countryman Federer. It is the culmination of a year in which Wawrinka has climbed while Federer has faltered. Wawrinka convincingly won his fourth-round match Tuesday, beating No. 5 Tomas Berdych in four sets. “I feel this year for sure many things changed for me, and unfortunately Roger is not playing that great in this year, so that’s why it changed a little bit,” Wawrinka said. “But for me, Roger is a great, great friend, first, and he’s the best player ever on the tour so far. I just hope that he will come back stronger. I am playing great, I am the last Swiss guy, but I wish he was still playing, because I like when we play good in the same tournaments.”
0~The Next Privacy Battle in Europe Is Over This New Law~The new European data privacy legislation is so stringent that it could kill off data-driven online services and chill innovations like driverless cars, tech industry groups warn. The American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union called the legislation “overly strict.” The Developers Alliance, a trade group representing Facebook, Google, Intel and dozens of app makers, said it could cost businesses in Europe more than 550 billion euros, or about $640 billion, in annual lost revenue. And DigitalEurope, another tech trade group, said the legislation’s prohibitive approach “seriously undermines the development of Europe’s digital economy.” These industry alarms are not over the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., a tough privacy law that went into effect in the European Union on Friday. Instead, the cause is an even stricter privacy law that’s pending — the tech industry’s next regulatory battleground in Europe. It is called the ePrivacy Regulation, and it specifically protects the confidentiality of electronic communications. The law was approved by the European Parliament last fall and is under review by the Council of the European Union, a group of government officials representing the 28 member countries. Bloc officials had originally intended for the law to go into effect this month, but Council negotiations have been slowed by internal disagreements.
0~Coronavirus Surges in Middle East, Africa, Latin America and South Asia~CAIRO — For months, one enduring mystery of the coronavirus was why some of the world’s most populous countries, with rickety health systems and crowded slums, had managed to avoid the brunt of an outbreak that was burning through relatively affluent societies in Europe and the United States. Now some of those countries are tumbling into the maw of the pandemic, and they are grappling with the likelihood that their troubles are only beginning. Globally, known cases of the virus are growing faster than ever with more than 100,000 new ones a day. The surge is concentrated in densely populated, low- and middle-income countries across the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and South Asia. Not only has it filled hospitals and cemeteries there, it has frustrated the hopes of leaders who thought they were doing everything right, or who believed they might somehow escape the pandemic’s worst ravages.
0~Israeli Court Rules for Women at Western Wall~JERUSALEM — In the latest twist in the struggle for the character of the Western Wall, a magistrates’ court here ruled on Thursday that five women who had been detained at the Jewish holy site that morning for wearing prayer shawls and singing aloud were not disturbing public order, as the police had asserted. The women, activists with Women of the Wall, a feminist and pluralist religious group, were released without conditions; the police had requested that they be barred from attending their group’s monthly prayer at the wall for the next three months. The courtroom turnaround came days after Natan Sharansky, the chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, outlined a proposal for easing tensions at the site between Orthodox and more progressive worshipers. The compromise involves expanding the existing area of prayer to create a section with unfettered access for Jews wishing to pray in a less Orthodox, more egalitarian style. Contention over rituals has peaked in recent months and caused discord between the Israeli authorities and Jewish leaders abroad. The focus on freedoms at the site also comes amid a broader rift in Israeli society between the ultra-Orthodox minority and other religious and secular communities. Many Israelis object to what they see as the undue influence of the ultra-Orthodox in politics and public life. The new government formed last month excluded the ultra-Orthodox parties that have been part of most governing coalitions since the late 1970s.
0~Orlando Gunman Attacks Gay Nightclub, Leaving 50 Dead~Joel Figueroa and his friends “were dancing by the hip-hop area when I heard shots, bam, bam, bam,” he said, adding, “Everybody was screaming and running toward the front door.” Pulse, which calls itself “Orlando’s Latin Hotspot,” was holding its weekly “Upscale Latin Saturdays” party. The shooting began around 2 a.m., and some patrons thought at first that the booming reports they heard were firecrackers or part of the loud, thumping dance music. Some people who were trapped inside hid where they could, calling 911 or posting messages to social media, pleading for help. The club posted a stark message on its Facebook page: “Everyone get out of pulse and keep running.” Hundreds of people gathered in the glare of flashing red lights on the fringes of the law enforcement cordon around the nightclub, and later at area hospitals, hoping desperately for some word on the fates of their relatives and friends. More than 12 hours after the attack, anguished relatives paced between Orlando Regional Medical Center and a nearby hotel as they waited for word. They were told that so many were gunned down that victims would be tagged as anonymous until the hospital was able to identify them. “We are here suffering, knowing nothing,” said Baron Serrano, whose brother, Juan Rivera, 36, had been celebrating a friend’s birthday with his husband and was now unaccounted for. “I cannot understand why they can’t tell me anything because my brother is a very well-known person here in Orlando. He is a hairstylist, and everybody knows him.”
0~Some Healthy Americans Seek Coronavirus Booster Shots Before Approval~Amy Piccioni is not a doctor or a scientist, but as word of breakthrough coronavirus infections in vaccinated people started spreading this summer, she waded through an array of technical and often contradictory information about the need for coronavirus booster shots. Then she decided for herself: She would not wait for federal regulators to clear them before finding one. “It takes a long time for scientists to admit that some people need a booster,” said Ms. Piccioni, 55, who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine last November through a clinical trial and timed her booster around a visit to her father in July, thinking it would protect her on the plane. She walked into her local Walgreens, asked for a Pfizer shot and got it, no questions asked. “All I could think about was how low the vaccination rate is in some areas,” said Ms. Piccioni, who lives near Del Mar, Calif., and is in good health. “Those doses don’t last forever, so I felt no guilt about taking one that probably would have expired.” While tens of millions of Americans continue to decline even a first Covid-19 vaccine, a small but growing number have sought out additional shots even though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved them and it remains unclear who precisely needs one and when.
0~Sheryl Lee Ralph sings her thanks for her first Emmy.~Sheryl Lee Ralph won her first Emmy on Monday night, opening her acceptance speech by belting “Endangered Species,” a song by Dianne Reeves. “I am an endangered species,” sang Ralph, who is also a Broadway performer, “but I sing no victim’s song. I am a woman, I am an artist, and I know where my voice belongs.” Ralph won an Emmy for best supporting actress in a comedy for her role as Barbara Howard, a no-nonsense kindergarten teacher, in “Abbott Elementary.” Ralph, 65, who has been a screen actress since the 1970s and has performed on Broadway since the 1980s, was full of emotion as she accepted her award — which followed her first-ever nomination. “To anyone who has ever, ever had a dream and thought your dream wasn’t, wouldn’t, couldn’t come true,” Ralph said, “I am here to tell you that this is what believing looks like. This is what striving looks like. And don’t you ever, ever give up on you.”

0~Borrowing G.O.P. Playbook, Democratic States Sue the Government and Rack Up Wins~During the administration of President Barack Obama, attorneys general from Republican states developed a powerful tool: They teamed up dozens of times to sue the federal government to block environmental initiatives. Now, Democrats are using the same playbook to fight the Trump administration. Blue-state attorneys general have filed more than two dozen environmental lawsuits against the Trump administration since January 2017, and the victories are piling up. This month, a court said the Environmental Protection Agency had broken the law by delaying smog protections. In February, states forced the Department of Energy to enact efficiency standards for household appliances. And in two different decisions in the past year, courts thwarted the administration’s attempts to delay regulations on emissions by the oil and gas industry. The rise of state attorneys general as partisan warriors against presidential administrations is a relatively new phenomenon, according to some who served in more amicable days. “Up until 1999, the attorneys general were very nonpartisan,” said Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general and a Republican. For instance, Republicans and Democrats in the 1990s teamed up to sue the tobacco industry over the health effects of its products and the burdens cigarette smoking placed on state Medicaid budgets. Mr. Woods recalled that, when pursuing such cases with fellow state attorneys general, he was not even sure of some colleagues’ party affiliations. “Today everyone has it branded on their forehead, like a scarlet letter,” he said.
0~Hong Kong Police, Once Called ‘Asia’s Finest,’ Are Now a Focus of Anger~HONG KONG — The 30,000-member Hong Kong police force was long known as “Asia’s finest.” Then with the world watching, they tear-gassed and beat largely peaceful demonstrators and fired rubber bullets at them. Some officers appeared to hide their badges to avoid identification. Now the force is struggling to salvage a reputation blighted by its behavior in the June 12 protests over a proposed extradition law that convulsed Hong Kong, the semiautonomous Chinese territory. Faced with public fury over their crowd-control tactics, the police retreated and watched as thousands of young demonstrators besieged their headquarters for 15 hours last week, barricading the exits, throwing eggs and spraying graffiti on the walls. Officers ducked their heads as protesters aimed laser pointers at them, and a police spokeswoman who urged the demonstrators to leave was drowned out by jeering.
0~Justice Dept. Watchdog to Investigate Seizure of Democrats’ Data~In an interview with Politico on Friday, Mr. Barr sought to distance himself from the tactics. He said he was “not aware of any congressman’s records being sought in a leak case” while he was attorney general. The subpoenas to Apple and Microsoft for congressional records were issued before his tenure. Congressional Democrats welcomed the assurance from the Biden administration but signaled that they were unwilling to take the Justice Department at its word. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said the department had a “very short window to make a clean break from the Trump era on this matter” before his panel would step in. “We expect the department to provide a full accounting of these cases, and we expect the attorney general to hold the relevant personnel accountable for their conduct,” Mr. Nadler said. “If the department does not make substantial progress toward these two goals, then we on the Judiciary Committee will have no choice but to step in and do the work ourselves.” The Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, might stand the best chance of piecing together a full picture of what took place. He said on Friday that he would review the department’s use of subpoenas and other legal maneuvers to secretly seize communications records associated with both Congress and reporters. “The review will examine the department’s compliance with applicable D.O.J. policies and procedures, and whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations,” Mr. Horowitz said. His announcement followed a referral by the deputy attorney general, Lisa O. Monaco, according to a senior Justice Department official; Attorney General Merrick B. Garland directed her to take that step, the official said. Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for an inspector general investigation. Mr. Schiff welcomed the inquiry but said it was insufficient. He called on Congress to take a broader look at “the systemic politicization of the department and its mission, and other flagrant abuses.”
0~Buttigieg Tells Police Recruits of the Burden of Racial Injustice~SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Mayor Pete Buttigieg took a third day off from the campaign trail on Wednesday to confront a crisis over the fatal police shooting of a black resident of South Bend, Ind. Mr. Buttigieg said he was “extremely frustrated” that the white officer’s body camera was switched off at the time. The shooting of the 54-year-old man revived longstanding mistrust by some black residents of the city police and of Mr. Buttigieg, and it has presented the mayor, a Democratic presidential candidate, with a national leadership test just a week before the first primary debates. The case has revived scrutiny of Mr. Buttigieg’s history of sometimes strained relations with African-Americans in South Bend. The issue is echoing in the Democratic primary as Mr. Buttigieg, 37, seeks to improve his support with black voters. [18 questions. 21 Democrats. Here’s what they said.] After addressing a half-dozen newly sworn-in officers — all white — on Wednesday morning, Mr. Buttigieg, the son of two Notre Dame professors, acknowledged to reporters outside police headquarters that he had only a “theoretical” understanding of the charged issue of race and policing when he took office nearly eight years ago.

0~Gerard Mortier, Opera Visionary and Patron of New Work, Dies at 70~Gerard Mortier, a visionary opera company leader whose bold theatricality and updating of the canon helped define the art form’s modern history, died on Saturday at his home in Brussels. He was 70. The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Simon Bauwens, his personal assistant at Teatro Real in Madrid. Mr. Mortier was that company’s artistic director from 2009 until last year, when his title was changed to artistic adviser in a tussle with the Spanish government over his successor after he announced in September that he was being treated for cancer. It was a characteristic dispute for a man who always relished a battle during a four-decade career at the helm of some of the world’s most important opera companies, including the Salzburg Festival and the Paris Opera.
0~Through the Outback~One night in Queensland, two greys hopped onto the road and one stopped and stood upright; I could neither stop nor swerve, only watch it explode on impact into a pink mist. Another time, in the Northern Territory, wedge-tailed eagles dived between the sporadic cars and trucks to feed on rotting animal carcasses. Mine was a journey of more than 19,000 kilometers (12,000 miles), crisscrossing desert, mines, wheat belts and cattle stations. The path was dotted with roadkill, mainly kangaroos: I hit seven myself, killing five. I spent most of the last dozen years away from Australia, making photographs of other people’s mythical and mysterious places: Afghanistan and Iraq, Greece and Ireland, India and the Middle East. In December, I turned my eye on remote regions much closer to home. I grew up in what we call regional Australia — the small cities outside the major capitals — but my mum was from Yeoval, a farming village that was also the childhood home of Banjo Paterson, the Australian poet who romanticized bush life. Until my grandfather died, a slide carousel was a staple of family Christmases: the photographs of Nan, Pop and their five daughters dressed in white English pomp for a country show or the horse races were my own iconic images of this mysterious land. It has been mythologized in poetry and song, made horrific in films like “Wake in Fright,” and infused into Australia’s history and psyche. Yet few Australians, including myself, have fully explored its realities. There is a place beyond the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, lost to the shining lights of Australia ’s suburban sprawl. Known vaguely, if romantically, as the outback, or the bush, it has no demarcated border but refers to the nation’s vast, sparsely populated interior — 73 percent of Australia’s territory — more than two million square miles — dotted with 5 percent of its 24 million people. “I like the remoteness,” she added. “I like people, and meeting people, and that sort of thing, but I like to be able to walk away and go back to my own area. I could never live with a neighbor there and a neighbor there — that just does my head in.” The nearest supermarket, though, remains a two-and-a-half hour drive away, so Ms. Warn said she went shopping only once every two weeks, adding, “You have to be organized living out here.” Ms. Warn, 45, grew up in the bush — her parents had a fence-building business, too. They dug holes for the posts with a shovel back then, not a custom hydraulic driver. “Adam can drive 75 posts in a day,” she pointed out. “My father, if he put 10 posts in a day, he had a bloody good day.” I found Lynette Warn at the Walkabout Creek Hotel in McKinlay — the town where the bar scenes for “Crocodile Dundee” were filmed — and ended up drunk with her daughter and the daughter’s boyfriend. The next day, they took me to the trailer-home that Lynette and her husband, Adam, live out of as they roam from job site to job site installing fences. Word of mouth was my best asset in the bush. One publican introduced me to the owner of a sheep station near Tambo, where I met shearers whom I reconnected with 200 miles away a few weeks later. That same farmer posted on Facebook that I was looking for a cattle muster, which led me to Islay Plains, where I met a family that had turned its farm organic after a drought. When I was vouched for by one person, I was O.K. to another. Isla Hughes, a young governess, was holding a jug of Midori cocktails on the veranda of the pub in Tibooburra, New South Wales, on New Year’s Day. The night before, I had noticed Michael Koke, 18, in the stock yards at the local rodeo. Theirs were among a series of portraits I made — using film instead of digital cameras — throughout my time on the road, a collection of faces, clothing and backdrops that I see as puzzle pieces of the outback I discovered. One cliché that rang true on my travels was genuine country hospitality. I started out trying to set up subjects ahead of time, but found it difficult to predict which events or personalities would yield the best stories. So I abandoned plans in favor of walking into a country pub and seeing who wanted to chat at the bar. The population of the area has been dropping for decades, especially as a proportion of growing Australia. At the same time, Aboriginal Australians are a growing presence, a majority in many small towns losing white residents to bigger cities: They are 3 percent of Australia’s people, but a quarter of those in remote areas. I met people filling those roles during my three-month tour, of course, but these archetypes are, increasingly, being squeezed out by modernization. The centralization of business and services, the flight of youth in search of better prospects, the aggregation and mechanization of farming, climate change ’s turning the region’s signature red dust into a growing threat, and the endemic poverty of Indigenous Australians have redefined today’s outback. The outback of Australia’s post-colonial imagination — or at least the version of my suburban, 1980s childhood imagination — involves an explorer confronting an untamed land, trying to forge a country through hard work and freedom; its archetypes include drover, stockman, Aboriginal tracker, gold miner, shearer, landlord and outlaw. “Anything with four legs is very expensive at the moment, which is good if you have something to sell, but if you’re buying back it’s expensive,” he pointed out. “Once upon a time in a drought you could just close the doors, the business would stop, you could stop your expenditure. Now rents and rates are really high, they are two of my biggest costs. We are a long way short of recovering from the drought.” Adrian and Julie Brown, farmers at Marchmont Station in Queensland, had practically the reverse experience. The drought led them to sell 1,000 head of cattle and 10,000 head of sheep in 2014 and 2015. The castrated rams, called wethers, brought $46 to $48 each. In 2016, when the rains started, they restocked with 5,500 sheep — at $90.50. “At the time, beef was $3 a kilo on the hook and an organic one was $5.50 a kilo,” he said, citing Australian dollar figures. The difference equated to $500 an animal. “During the drought in 2012, ’13, ’14, the prices were crap, something had to change,” explained Mr. Appleton, who is 40. “We had heard about organics and I thought it would all be a load of wallop, but we looked into it a bit more. We decided we were basically organic anyway, so we thought: Why not get accredited for it? Australia is the driest inhabited continent on Earth, and, according to a 2015 Climate Council report , climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of heat waves, which in turn increases the severity of droughts. Mr. Appleton, though, is a man who embraces change. Three years ago, he and his wife, Anna, invested $1.2 million in a long-term water supply and organic processes to insulate their operations against global warming. I heard many complaints about this method from old-timers like Azzie Zilla Fazulla, 90, a former drover in Tibooburra. “The young fellas, I don’t know, they are a good mob of blokes, but they are too fast,” he said. “You can’t push cattle too hard. Some of the old stockmen would turn over in their graves.” One morning, Fred Appleton took me up in his helicopter as the day’s first sun splashed across the gum trees of Islay Plains cattle station, which he has owned since 2007. We bounced and weaved, spotting black and brown cows, then swooping down to muster them in a common direction. Young ringers on motorbikes rounded up the stragglers, and four hours later a herd of 800 was ready for counting and branding. The slow-paced droving days of Paterson’s poem “ Clancy of the Overflow” are gone. Smaller farms have increasingly aggregated into larger conglomerates. It’s the ghost of drovers that wander behind cattle in today’s bush. Raising cattle and sheep is an integral part of the outback’s history, shaping the region’s culture, landscape and work force, and helping drive the national economy. Like everything everywhere, the pastoral farm has been transformed in recent years both by technology and by climate change. “We don’t get workers from the gold mine coming to the pub anymore,” Mr. Smith lamented. “They fly out and the money leaves the town, or they don’t come because they are too tired from long shifts. It’s just, it’s killing the place.” But in Kalgoorlie, one of Australia’s legendary mining towns, I saw the flip side of the FIFO coin. Kenneth Smith, 74, has owned the Grand Hotel since 1983. He told me stories about a pub so packed he needed four barmaids on a shift; there were three drinkers the night I visited. The pub itself looks like a movie set that was abandoned 20 years ago. One of those people is Tom Schluter, 49, an Australian who moved to Thailand six years ago and now is part of the “fly-in, fly-out” work force, or FIFO for short, that is deeply resented by many of the old-timers I met. He works for two weeks, then is off for one. When he works — on the road crew at Solomon Hub, the flagship mine of the Fortescue Metals Group, in the Pilbara region of northwest Australia — it’s more than 80 hours per week. There are 400 mines producing 19 different minerals, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and mining employs 266,000 people, with the nation’s highest average hourly wage ($56.90 in the local currency). Mining remains a lifeblood in the bush, 176 years after lead was first extracted from the South Australian soil in 1841. It generates about 115 billion Australian dollars (about $87 billion) annually, or 6.9 percent of G.D.P., according to a 2015-16 government report , buffering Australia from recent global financial crises. “You don’t talk about your biggest find,” he said. “No one likes, Australians in general, no one likes a smart arse or a bragger.” He remembers when there were “three or four thousand miners” in the town back in the 1970s, and says “now there’s probably 10 or 15 at the most.” We drove a few miles out of town to a landscape pockmarked with excavations. He hopped in an earth mover and dug. Every so often he would jump out to search for a sign of an opal seam. I’m no expert, my only experience with opal being a primary school excursion to Lightning Ridge , the tourist magnet famous for its black opals, but it seemed more intuition than science. George Kountouris, 60, is a second-generation Australian whose family is from Sparta, Greece, and a second-generation opal miner. He sleeps at his store to protect his stones, with a 88-pound Doberman named Sir Winston and four security cameras. “You can work for three months and not see a chip of opal,” explained Rudi Fletcher, 81, an Austrian who came to Australia at 23 for a working holiday with a mining company and never left. “Opal is where opal wants to be, not where we want it to be.” Opal is Australia’s national gemstone. In Coober Pedy, a town in South Australia where temperatures soar so high people live underground in shallow burrows they call “dugouts,” freelance prospectors stake their claims and dig for opal to sell to tourists or Chinese dealers. In the mid-1900s, Wilcannia, was a thriving river town with a population of 3,000 and 13 busy hotels. Now, there are about 600 people, about 60 percent of them Aboriginal, and the last remaining hotel serves beer in cans not glasses, lest they be used as a weapon. Wilcannia had the country’s third-highest per-capita crime rate last year: Suicide, alcoholism and unemployment are also all rampant. I remember when I was growing up, people joked that it was a place you should not stop. These were usually white Australians without much direct experience or close interaction with Indigenous Australians. I had never spent much time in Aboriginal communities, either. Now, as a journalist eager to understand all kinds of people, of course I wanted to stop. A pink sunset was fading as I pulled in to find a group of Aboriginal teenagers, some on foot and some on BMX bikes, meandering down a wide empty street. Their dress was American hip-hop, a sign of what Virgean Wilson, a social worker, said was “strangling our culture.” “I look out the window here and I see our children dressed like the American Negro and using that horrible slang and listening to that mind-boggling music that doesn’t have a meaning to us,” she said. Though many young Indigenous Australians would undoubtedly disagree, Mrs. Wilson connected this trend with the rising suicide rate in the community. “It takes them down this pathway of more misery,” she said, adding: “I hear young people, as young as 7, say, ‘I am going to kill myself.’” Suicide was, indeed, the leading cause of death for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders ages 15 to 34 from 2011 to 2015, according to the bureau of statistics. The suicide rate is 9.3 per 100,000 for Indigenous children ages 5 to 17, compared with 1.8 for their nonindigenous peers. Benita Kennedy’s brother, William Roger Shane Kennedy, hanged himself at their auntie’s house last year. The photo on his funeral program showed a smiling William holding a half-crushed can of Victoria Bitter beer. He was 25. Talking to dozens of Aboriginal Australians during my travels, I kept asking about the source of the deep social problems plaguing their communities. No one had any clear answers, but it felt like their world had just changed too fast: for 40,000 years, their ancestors were hunter-gatherers guided largely by nature’s rhythms; in less than 250 years, they had that land taken and were forced to assimilate into a white man’s world. Daisy Ward, a Ngaanyatjarra elder in Warakurna, Western Australia, embodies the transition. She recalls going into town every two weeks as a child to watch black-and-white Hollywood westerns on a projector — and walking home into the desert, barefoot. When she was 9, she went on a field trip to Perth, the state capital, and she remembers “going to a statue and asking the statue, ‘Can you give me water, please?’” A friend whispered to her, “You have to turn the tap on.” We picked wild tobacco in the hill near where Ms. Ward was born in the bush, and she found a honey ant nest. Digging at the earth with an iron rod, she collected hundreds of ants whose abdomens were translucent sacs of sweet liquid, and we sucked them around a campfire while other elder women cooked kangaroo tails they bought frozen at the community store. “I feel proud to be an elder, to speak out and say what’s good, what’s better for young kids,” said Ms. Ward, who works as a community liaison at a local school. “I’m waiting with my hands out to give helping hands if they need it.” “Welcome to Paradise,” says a rusty sign in Wiluna, a town clear across the country from Wilcania — more than 1,800 miles, to be exact — but in a startlingly similar situation. A town once thriving with miners and stockmen, now dilapidated. Many of the white men have moved on with the profits of the land, leaving the traditional owners behind. Several folks I met there described it as the place where, in the 1970s, some of the last desert-dwelling Aboriginal Australians wandered, naked and dusty, spears in hand, into the white man’s industrialized world. Under the awning of the Wiluna Hotel, whose windows were boarded up, I met Jefry Stewart, who told me he was the last surviving child of one of those last desert nomads. Mr. Stewart asked me to buy him some beer, because it was one of the three days each week when Wiluna residents are restricted to buying only midstrength alcohol, but outsiders can still get full strength. I gave him a cigarette instead. Alcoholism and drug abuse — codeine, fentanyl and illicit drugs like methamphetamine — are among the scourges that Superintendent Greg Moore is fighting in Bourke, a town with one of the highest crime rates in the country. That includes stock theft, trespassing, cybercrime and domestic violence. “There’s complex reasons for that,” Superintendent Moore said, referring to his town, whose population is about 40 percent Aboriginal, as “quite an eclectic blend, because we have 22 separate language groups represented.” He said he had tried to learn some of the local tongues. Darren Farmer, 47, speaks three Indigenous languages, and sells sandalwood from the desert for use in perfumes. While we chatted under a tin shelter a mile outside Wiluna, Mr. Farmer attacked the carcass of an emu he had hunted the day before, ripping the flesh off the bone with his teeth. The Aboriginal social structure, community leaders like Mr. Farmer told me, is based on shared possessions, not the competitive capitalism that is the basis of Australia’s economy and culture. He worried that young people were leaving the bush for the city, saying: “If we give up our land, we give up our identity.” It was fascinating, throughout my trip, to hear so many different people in so many places reflect on the changes they had seen in their hometowns, their homeland. Like so many others, Barney Davey, 91, lamented that ranchers now use the horsepower of motorbikes to move cattle rather than the power of actual horses. But Mr. Davey, the longtime publican in Tibooburra, where I had spent New Year’s Eve, had a sunny-side-up attitude you had to appreciate. “They say the good old days, but I like these days too,” he noted. “We have air-conditioning, microwave ovens, the roads have improved.”
0~His Defense of Hindus Was to Kill a Muslim and Post the Video~AHMEDABAD, India — The attack begins with a Hindu man, wearing a bright shirt and a white scarf, stepping off a motorbike carrying a long iron pickax. He pounces on an older Muslim man, attacking him from behind and striking him over and over. “Babu, save my life! Save my life!” the Muslim man screams. He crumples to the ground, and a few seconds later, after several more blows from the pickax, he cries, “I’m dead, I’m dead.” He soon is. The killing was captured on video — at the attacker’s request. He had his nephew film the entire episode with a phone and proudly posted it on social media, bragging that he had killed the man to protect his Hindu community from Muslim jihadists. India’s biggest television channels aired the video, and it jumped at light speed across the country on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp, immediately stirring tensions. The Hindu-Muslim fault line in India can be very raw, and in recent years several Muslims have been lynched by Hindu mobs.
0~Obama Releases Long-Form Birth Certificate~WASHINGTON — President Obama released his long-form birth certificate on Wednesday, a step that injected him directly into the simmering “birther” controversy in the hope of finally ending it, or even turning it to his advantage. The gamble produced dramatic television as Mr. Obama strode into the White House briefing room to address, head on, a subject that had been deemed irrelevant by everyone in his orbit for years even as it stoked conservative efforts to undermine his legitimacy as president. Mr. Obama’s comments risked elevating the discredited questions about where he was born, but also allowed him to cast his political opponents as focused on the trivial at a time when the nation is facing more important issues. And because much of the recent attention about where he was born came from Donald J. Trump, who says he is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination and spent the day campaigning in New Hampshire, it allowed the White House to use Mr. Trump as a foil for the president’s efforts to cast himself as a more serious leader than his potential rivals in the 2012 race.
0~C.D.C. Urges Flu Shots to Reduce Strain on Health Care System~Lockdowns helped keep last year’s flu season historically mild in both the United States and around the world, but U.S. officials fear a more serious season this fall and winter, with unmasked people out and about far more, and nearly half of adults in a new survey saying they are unlikely to get a flu shot. At a news briefing to release the survey data on Thursday morning, top health experts said they were particularly concerned that, with the coronavirus still coursing around the country, nearly one in four people at higher risk for flu-related complications indicated they did not intend to get the flu vaccine. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted that while experts did not yet know how severely the flu would hit the United States this fall, other respiratory infections had already returned, including RSV, a common cause of pneumonia and bronchitis in babies and a serious threat to older adults. The C.D.C.’s latest weekly flu report shows that only one state, Wyoming, had reached a “moderate” level of flu cases. Because the flu was almost nonexistent last year, Dr. Walensky noted, people do not have the protective immunity they might have acquired if they had gotten sick, and she urged that everyone age 6 months and older be vaccinated. “The Covid-19 pandemic is not over, and the risk of both flu and Covid-19 circulating could put additional strain on hospitals and frontline health care professionals,” she said.
0~House Benghazi Report Finds No New Evidence of Wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton~AP TELEVISION - AP CLIENTS ONLY Washington DC - 28 June 2016 1. Various of members entering press conference 2. SOUNDBITE (English) Rep. Trey Gowdy, (R) South Carolina: “After more than 100 witness interviews including more than 80 with witnesses no other committee in Congress talked to, and tens of thousands of pages of documents that is the single greatest impression that we are left with, that there are men and women who love this country enough and what it stands for and how it can inspire others to serve in dangerous places under dangerous circumstances, so I will respectfully ask my citizens to simply do this, read the report. Read the report and if you do read the report I think what will become manifest to you is what has become manifest to us which are two different images, the image on the one hand of what was happening in Benghazi during the relevant time period, and the image on the other hand of the decisions made and not made in Washington during that same time period.” 3. Cutaway 4. SOUNDBITE (English) Rep. Trey Gowdy, (R) South Carolina: “Nothing could have reached Benghazi because nothing was ever headed to Benghazi. No US military asset was ever deployed to Benghazi despite the order of the Secretary of Defense at 7:00 that night. So Washington had access to real time information but yet somehow they thought the fighting had subsided. Washington had access to real time information but somehow they thought these fighters were going to evacuate, even without the remains of the ambassador and without asking how was that evacuation supposed to be effectuated, how were you supposed to get from the annex to the Benghazi airport because it took you almost 3 hours to get you from the airport to the annex, who was supposed to take you? So those are the decisions being contemplated and discussed in Washington, and this mistaken belief that there was an evacuation that was eminent without asking the pretty fundamental questions, how do you expect us to effectuate this evacuation 5. Cutaway 6. SOUNDBITE (English) Rep. Mike Pompeo, (R) Kansas: “You can’t begin to exercise the leadership you need to exercise if you don’t understand what’s happening on the ground and if you choose to put political expediency and politics ahead of the men and women on the ground and for that you’ll have to answer for yourself, I find it morally reprehensible and behavior that if it were your son or your daughter or one of your family members or friends who were on that ground that night and you will watch the actions in Washington, D.C., you’d have every right to be disgusted with the response from the senior American leaders. This was a failure at the most senior level of government and one that I hope the recommendations that this committee presents will help making sure that something like this never happens again.”
0~Inflation Hits the British Breakfast Table With Rising Food Prices~LONDON — Britons can’t escape inflation. They’re reminded first thing every morning — when they tuck into breakfast. As soaring inflation takes its toll in the country — consumer prices rose in July 10.1 percent from the previous year, according to official statistics released last week — the prices for items associated with a basic breakfast in Britain have jumped. The squeeze isn’t just being felt at the breakfast table, either, with the overall rise in inflation being attributed in large part to higher food and drink prices across the board, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Assosia, a retail research firm, compared prices from Britain’s four largest supermarket chains, and the data showed significant increases for branded items on the shelves on Aug. 16, when compared with exactly one year ago, from bread to butter to baked beans. Here’s what that looks like (1 British pound = $1.19).
0~Home virus tests recalled over false positives reach 2 million kits.~The Australian company Ellume has expanded a recall of its at-home coronavirus test because of concerns about a “higher-than-acceptable” rate of false positives, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Tuesday. The recall now includes roughly two million of the 3.5 million test kits that Ellume had shipped to the United States by last month, a substantial increase from the company’s earlier estimate that about 427,000 of those kits were potentially faulty. It is not clear how many false positives the affected tests have yielded. The issue, which the company had previously traced to a problem with one of the raw materials used in its test kits, does not affect the reliability of negative results. The F.D.A. categorized the recall, which was first announced last month, as Class I, the most serious type. Use of the tests could have “serious adverse health consequences,” the agency said. People who falsely test positive for the virus may receive unnecessary treatments for Covid-19 and experience delays in being diagnosed with and treated for “the actual cause of the person’s illness,” the agency noted.
0~Putin Concedes That Some Men Were Wrongly Drafted~President Vladimir V. Putin acknowledged “mistakes” on Thursday in how the Russian government has been carrying out his draft, a sign of the Kremlin’s scramble to keep public discontent in check over Mr. Putin’s effort to escalate the war in Ukraine. In televised remarks to top security officials, Mr. Putin said that the draft had raised “many questions,” and that “all mistakes must be corrected and prevented from happening in the future.” He described cases of people entitled to deferments being wrongly drafted, such as fathers of three or more children, men with chronic diseases or those above military age. “If a mistake is made, I repeat, it must be corrected,” he said in a videoconference with his Security Council. “Those who were called up without proper reason should be returned home.” Mr. Putin’s remarks, which were shown on state television Thursday evening, came after anger with the draft spilled over into street protests across Russia, including in an impoverished region of Siberia on Thursday.

0~Saudi Arabia Says Detainees Handed Over More Than $100 Billion~BEIRUT, Lebanon — Saudi Arabia has collected more than $100 billion from prominent citizens who were detained in what the government has called a widespread crackdown on corruption, the kingdom said on Tuesday. Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb, the attorney general, said in a statement that 381 people had been summoned as part of the investigation. Many were brought in as witnesses, while others were accused of corruption and released only after handing over significant assets to the government, the statement said. The release of many of the detainees appeared to signal the wrapping up of the two-and-a-half-month campaign, in which some of the kingdom’s richest and most powerful men were locked in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where the authorities pressed them to hand over assets said to have been stolen from the state. The detainees included businessmen, current and former government ministers, and at least 11 princes, including Alwaleed bin Talal, the kingdom’s most famous investor, who was released on Saturday.
0~Why Georgia is Bracing for More Political Hurricanes~Why does seemingly every politically interested observer in America have — à la Ray Charles — Georgia on their mind? The landmark event was President Biden’s becoming the first Democrat at the top of the ticket to carry Georgia since 1992, in what was the most closely decided state in last year’s presidential race. Former President Donald J. Trump appeared especially fixated on the state and made it the main focus of his efforts to reverse the results of the national election. Georgia then played host to double runoff contests in January that flipped control of the Senate to Democrats. The fervor and spotlight will endure: The state is a focal point for the nation’s persistent voting rights battle, as Republicans move swiftly to roll back ballot access in what opponents say is clear targeting of Black voters with echoes of Jim Crow-era disenfranchisement. In 2022, the Peach State’s race for governor is likely to include perhaps the Democratic Party’s leading champion of voting rights, Stacey Abrams, in a replay of the 2018 grudge match between her and Gov. Brian Kemp, the Republican incumbent. One of the two Democrats who won their races in January, Senator Raphael Warnock, will also have to turn around and defend his seat next year in a race that Republicans are already eyeing as they seek to reclaim the chamber. Several local and national Republicans — including Mr. Trump — have tried to recruit the former University of Georgia football legend Herschel Walker to run for the seat, which could lend another wrinkle to the state’s political story, as if it needed one. Adding to the chaos, Mr. Kemp has become the target of a vendetta by Mr. Trump, who has condemned him for not doing more to deliver (or poach) victory for him in Georgia in November. This has also made Georgia the unquestioned center of the internal disputes that have roiled the Republican Party since November. Mr. Trump has seemed intent on making the state a key stop on a revenge tour he has waged against Republicans he has deemed insufficiently loyal to him — Mr. Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger chief among them.
0~China Pledged to Build a New Hospital in 10 Days. It’s Close.~WUHAN, China — People desperate for treatment started descending on a new hospital that was mostly built in just 10 days to help cope with the outbreak of the new coronavirus in the central city of Wuhan on Monday. Construction workers in hard hats, medical staff in hazmat suits, and men and women in army fatigues scrambled around the dusty site on Monday afternoon, dodging moving trucks, excavators and cranes. Workers were still trying to finish construction on the Huoshenshan Hospital — a name that means “Fire God Mountain” — even as the facility prepared to accept its first batch of patients, the official state broadcaster, China Central Television, reported. [Read: How to survive an outbreak.] Xue Ying, a resident of Wuhan, had driven to the new hospital hoping to find help for his increasingly unwell cousin. But city officials and signs on checkpoints have said the hospital would not accept walk-ins. Admission was only for patients with officially confirmed coronavirus infections who were transferred from other facilities.
0~Gloria Vanderbilt’s Beekman Place Apartment Is for Sale~When Gloria Vanderbilt was 91, she and her son Anderson Cooper wrote a book together called “The Rainbow Comes and Goes.” It was an epistolary memoir, conducted by email, in which Mr. Cooper asked his mother all the questions he hoped never to be left with after her death: her true feelings about her storied, often tragic life, with its unimaginable losses — her own father’s death when she was a baby; his brother Carter’s suicide at 23; his father Wyatt Cooper’s death at 50 (when Anderson was 10 and Carter 12) — and unlikely high points (as when Ms. Vanderbilt made a fortune in the 1970s by putting her name on a pair of jeans, and in so doing changed the fashion business forever, only to lose it to a scheming lawyer in cahoots with her own psychiatrist). Ms. Vanderbilt, famously candid (she once wrote an erotic novel, and sent the galleys to Mr. Cooper), was more than game. As for the big question, her own mortality, and how did she want to face it, Ms. Vanderbilt answered with characteristic humor, quoting Woody Allen, who once said that rather than live on in the hearts of his countrymen, given the choice, he’d prefer to live on in his apartment. (She then gave her son more practical instructions: cremation please, and in her yellow Fortuny dress. And do ask Judy Collins to sing “Amazing Grace.”) Ms. Vanderbilt died in 2019. She was 95. But as it happens, she did live on in her apartment, a layered, sumptuous jewel box of a place that looks like something out of “The Arabian Nights,” draped with swoops of orange silk, lacquered pink walls, mirrored halls, Russian icons and chandeliers from which Christmas ornaments hang year round. Decorating is autobiography, she often said, and 30 Beekman Place, her home for nearly a quarter century, tells a vibrant story. Her apartment is being listed by Ileen Schoenfeld and Aracely Moran of Brown Harris Stevens for $1.125 million; the monthly maintenance is $4,311. It has two bedrooms, a dining room, a kitchen with a breakfast room and two and a half bathrooms. Her ground floor studio — technically a two-bedroom apartment — may also be for sale, with a price yet to be determined. (It’s a relatively low price for a Classic Five but the apartment is on a low floor, has a high maintenance and is in a neighborhood that is slightly off the beaten track. Also, unrenovated since 1997, when Ms. Vanderbilt moved in, it needs a total rehab.)
0~Seizures of Illegal Ivory Are Rising in Hong Kong~HONG KONG — Customs officials in Hong Kong announced on Friday their third large seizure of smuggled ivory in less than three months, saying they had intercepted 779 elephant tusks weighing 2,900 pounds in a container originating from Kenya. The shipment was valued at around $1.4 million. In October, 1,209 tusks weighing 3.8 tons and worth about $3.5 million were seized from two containers shipped from Tanzania and Kenya. The next month, 1.6 tons were discovered in a container originating from Tanzania. Large seizures also have been made in other countries recently, notably in Port Klang, Malaysia, last month. Demand from an increasingly affluent Asia and improved international trade and transport links have caused the trade in ivory and other wildlife products to soar in recent years, pushing many species to the brink. At the same time, enforcement and penalties remain weak in many countries, constituting little deterrent to smugglers and poachers, conservationists say.
0~N.Y.C. Schools Will Reopen in a Month. Principals Fear It’s Too Soon.~Alexa Sorden, an elementary school principal in the Bronx, has been pacing through the empty hallways of her school, trying to figure out how to make the most consequential school reopening effort in the country actually work. Along with about 1,700 other school principals in New York City, Ms. Sorden has spent the summer racing to complete a dizzying set of tasks: calculating how many students she can safely allow in her building while adhering to social distancing; creating a curriculum and schedule to accommodate children in-person and online; and keeping a steady line of communication with nervous staff and traumatized parents. Her efforts will help to determine whether the nation’s largest school district can reopen this fall. New York City, where the virus is currently under control, is the only major school district in the U.S. still planning to welcome children into classrooms part time this fall. By trying to execute the high-stakes reopening plan, New York City’s principals have been quietly shaping what pandemic-era schooling could look like, not just for the city’s 1.1 million students but for children nationwide. New York’s reopening plans are being closely watched by politicians and school superintendents around the country.
0~Fed’s Proponent for Regulation to Depart, Leaving 3 Vacancies~WASHINGTON — Daniel K. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve official who led its efforts to strengthen financial regulation over the last eight years, announced on Friday that he planned to leave the central bank in early April. With Mr. Tarullo’s resignation, there will be three vacancies on the Fed’s seven-seat board, providing an opportunity for President Trump to start reshaping the Fed’s approach to monetary policy and to the regulation of the financial industry. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are pressing for the Fed and other financial regulators to reduce the constraints on financial institutions imposed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Tarullo offered no explanation for his departure in a terse, two-sentence letter to Mr. Trump. But eight years is an unusually long tenure for a Fed governor — many leave after just two or three — and people who know Mr. Tarullo said that in recent years he had become increasingly worn down by the job.
0~How Trump’s Refusal to Concede Affects Biden’s National Security Transition~President Trump’s refusal to concede the election to President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. has already affected Mr. Biden’s transition, particularly on national security issues. Mr. Biden has yet to receive a presidential daily briefing, and it was unclear whether his team would have access to classified information, the most important pipeline for them to learn about the threats facing the United States. Like previous presidents-elect, Mr. Biden is receiving Secret Service protection, and a no-fly zone has been established over his home in Delaware. But if Mr. Trump’s administration continues its refusal to recognize Mr. Biden as the winner, it could complicate his security until his inauguration. Here are some of the issues at play: Presidential Daily Briefings Mr. Trump can prevent Mr. Biden and his aides from receiving the presidential daily briefing, the compendium of the government’s latest secrets and best intelligence insights, for the entire transition. No law states that Mr. Biden must receive it, though under previous administrations dating to at least 1968, presidents have authorized their elected successors to be given the briefing after clinching victory.
0~‘Hamilton’ and Other Broadway Shows Cancel Performances Through Christmas~Several of Broadway’s biggest shows, including “Hamilton,” “Hadestown” and “Aladdin,” are canceling all performances until after Christmas, and “Jagged Little Pill” announced it was closing for good, as a spike in coronavirus cases batters the performing arts throughout North America as well as in London. The cancellations, prompted by positive coronavirus tests among cast or crew members, come at the worst possible time for many productions, because the holiday season is typically the most lucrative time of year. It has been a trying week for the performing arts. On Saturday and Sunday, about a third of Broadway shows canceled their performances. On Monday, “Jagged Little Pill,” a rock musical featuring Alanis Morissette songs that had paused performances on Saturday after positive tests, said it would not reopen at all. The musical had still been finding its financial footing when the pandemic hit, and then was rocked again by the Omicron variant; its producers said in a statement that “the rapid spread of the Omicron variant has, once again, changed everything.”
0~Leonard Leo’s Powerful Conservative Network Is Not Easily Defined~The network of increasingly influential conservative groups that Leonard A. Leo has helped to create and shape is not easily defined or quantified. It is funded mostly by so-called dark money that is difficult to trace. The roster of nonprofit groups has evolved, with some ceasing operations and others being added. Mr. Leo has formal leadership roles in some groups, while he is an informal adviser to others. Most of the nonprofit groups have paid him or his for-profit firms, CRC Advisors and BH Group. The groups included in The New York Times’s analysis include: The 85 Fund and the Concord Fund: Formerly known as the Judicial Education Project and Judicial Crisis Network, respectively, these groups are run by Mr. Leo’s allies. But they have paid his for-profit groups, including more than $7.4 million to BH Group, which is owned at least partly by Mr. Leo, since the beginning of 2016; and more than $18.3 million to CRC Advisors since Mr. Leo joined that firm in 2020. The 85 Fund and the Concord Fund act as funding hubs to a broader coalition, disseminating tens of millions of dollars in grants to allied nonprofits, and serving as incubators for in-house projects, including one highlighting critical race theory in schools and another fighting Democratic efforts to expand voter access. America Engaged, BH Fund, and Freedom and Opportunity Fund: These three groups, which are controlled partly by Mr. Leo, were formed in 2016 as he started experimenting with how to build a political financing network. They paid CRC nearly $2.8 million, albeit before Mr. Leo joined the firm. Freedom and Opportunity Fund, which was intended to act as a pass-through for donors to steer money to an array of politically oriented and other groups, closed at the end of 2018, after Mr. Leo started a different group. Marble Freedom Trust: This group, which is controlled by Mr. Leo, was formed in May 2020. Over the next year, it paid him $350,000 and received a donation of $1.6 billion worth of company shares from a major donor. Federalist Society: The group where Mr. Leo made his name paid him more than $500,000 in the last year during which he helped lead it on a daily basis, from 2019 into 2020. He remains co-chairman of the group, which paid CRC more than $1.5 million after he joined the firm. Rule of Law Trust: Formed in 2018 as a sort of hub for disseminating funds to other groups, this group listed Mr. Leo as its sole trustee and has paid more than $1.5 million to a Federalist Society official who became a partner at CRC Advisors. Wellspring Committee: Initially functioning as part of the Koch brothers’ network in the run-up to the 2008 election, this group was used by Mr. Leo’s allies to funnel money to the outfit that became the Concord Fund. Wellspring paid Mr. Leo’s BH Group nearly $1.7 million in 2016 and 2017, before closing down at the end of 2018. Mr. Leo described this network as an effort to match a big-money operation aligned with Democrats that helped the left surge past the right in dark money spending in 2020, the most recent year for which comprehensive nonprofit filings are available. Mr. Leo also sits on the boards of other groups that have received funds from the network for socially conservative causes, including fighting policies they say are infringements against religious rights.
0~Iran Strikes Kurdish Opposition Groups in Northern Iraq~Iranian forces unleashed drone and artillery attacks on the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq on Monday, targeting what Tehran said were bases of militant Iranian Kurdish separatist groups there, according to a semiofficial news agency. The attacks by the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps were the second in three days against Iranian militants based in Iraq, according to the Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards. The new strikes occurred as Iran was reeling from 10 days of protests over the killing of Mahsa Amini, 22, an Iranian Kurdish woman, in police custody. She had been accused of violating the country’s strict codes on modest dress for women. The largest antigovernment movement since the country’s 2009 Green Revolution, the protest has thrust Iran into turmoil that has cut across ethnic and social divides. The unrest has been especially intense in northwest Iran, where many members of the country’s Kurdish minority live.
0~In Republican Debate, a Feisty Marco Rubio Lays Into Donald Trump~Senator Marco Rubio, alarmed by Donald J. Trump’s ascendancy and worried that his presidential chances were slipping away, unleashed a barrage of attacks on the real estate mogul’s business ethics, hiring practices and financial achievements in Thursday’s debate, forcefully delivering the onslaught that Republican leaders had desperately awaited. In a series of acid exchanges, a newly pugnacious Mr. Rubio, long mocked for a robotic and restrained style, interrupted Mr. Trump, quizzed him, impersonated him, shouted over him and left him looking unsettled. It was an unfamiliar reversal of roles for the front-runner, who found himself so frequently the target of assaults from Mr. Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz that he complained they must have been a ploy for better television ratings. From the opening moments of the debate, Mr. Rubio pounced. Deploying his own up-by-the-bootstraps biography, the Florida senator assailed Mr. Trump for hiring hundreds of foreign workers at his tony resort in Florida and passing over Americans who had applied for the same jobs. “My mom was a maid in a hotel,” Mr. Rubio said. “And instead of hiring an American like her, you’ve brought over 1,000 people from all over the world to fill in those jobs instead.”
0~Macron’s Proposal to Mollify Yellow Vest Protesters Fails to Impress~PARIS — The fine print of President Emmanuel Macron’s financial proposal, intended to end protests by France’s middle class and working poor, was still sinking in Tuesday, but many of the protesters were expressing disappointment and calling for new demonstrations this weekend. The president’s 13-minute speech on Monday evening detailed an increase in the amount minimum wage workers would receive in their pockets each month (100 euros, or $113), an exemption from taxes on overtime pay, and an exemption on certain social security taxes for retirees who earn less than 2,000 euros, or $2,265, a month. The proposals showed that the president was prepared to move “quickly and forcefully” to respond to the anger of working people who cannot make ends meet, said Édouard Philippe, the prime minister. But the intended beneficiaries of the changes said they were doubtful about how helpful they would be, and local elected officials said their constituents had mixed views of the president’s plan and his tone.
0~Bulletproof, Slow and Full of Wine: Kim Jong-un’s Mystery Train~More powerful than a speeding bullet, but much slower Much of what is known about the train comes from intelligence reports, recollections of officials permitted to travel on board in previous eras and rare state news media footage. There are believed to be at least 90 high-security carriages at the leader’s disposal, according to a 2009 South Korea news report that relied on classified information. According to the report, written during the era of Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, three trains operate each time the leader travels: an advance security train, the leader’s train and a third carrying additional bodyguards and supplies. Each of the carriages is bulletproof, making them thousands of pounds heavier than average. That additional weight translates to a slow ride. The trains are estimated to reach a maximum speed of just 37 miles per hour. In Kim Jong-il’s time, according to the 2009 report, 100 security officers traveled in the advance train, searching stations for bombs and other threats and testing the safety of the track. Additionally, military helicopters and airplanes would fly overhead to provide more security. Twenty train stations have been built across North Korea just for the leader’s personal use, according to the report.

When he got stuck in traffic in 2016, he tweeted the idea of an underground tunnel system to alleviate “soul destroying” congestion. And when he challenged President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to one-on-one combat last month, he broadcast it on Twitter. Now Mr. Musk is putting his money where he mouths off. On Monday, a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that Mr. Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and the world’s wealthiest person, had bought a 9.2 percent stake in Twitter, the social media platform where he has over 80 million followers. The purchase appears to make Mr. Musk Twitter’s largest shareholder, ahead of the 8.8 percent stake owned by the mutual-fund company Vanguard and dwarfing the 2.3 percent stake of Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s former chief executive. Mr. Musk’s Twitter investment, which he has been accumulating since at least last month, was worth about $2.89 billion based on the closing price of the company’s stock on Friday. But by the end of Monday, after news of his buy-in sent Twitter’s share price soaring more than 27 percent, it was worth about $3.7 billion. The shares are a fraction of Mr. Musk’s reported $270 billion-plus net worth. Despite his penchant for sharing everything on Twitter — from business ideas, insults and memes to, this past weekend, his experience at a famed Berlin nightclub — Mr. Musk was uncharacteristically mum on the purchase of the company’s shares, at least initially.
0~Israel to Review Curbs on Women’s Prayer at Western Wall~JERUSALEM — Amid outrage across the Jewish diaspora over a flurry of recent arrests of women seeking to pray at the Western Wall with ritual garments in defiance of Israeli law, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked Natan Sharansky, the chairman of the Jewish Agency, to study the issue and suggest ways to make the site more accommodating to all Jews. The move comes after more than two decades of civil disobedience by a group called Women of the Wall against regulations, legislation and a 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling that allow for gender division at the wall, one of Judaism’s holiest sites, and prohibit women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls there. Although the movement has struggled to gain traction in Israel, where the ultra-Orthodox retain great sway over public life, the issue has deepened a divide between the Jewish state and Jews around the world at a time when Israel is battling international isolation over its settlement policy. Critics, particularly leaders of the Reform and Conservative movements in the United States, complain that the government’s recent aggressive enforcement of restrictions at the wall has turned a national monument into an ultra-Orthodox synagogue. “The prime minister thinks the Western Wall has to be a site that expresses the unity of the Jewish people, both inside Israel and outside the state of Israel,” Ron Dermer, Mr. Netanyahu’s senior adviser, said in an interview on Tuesday. “He wants to preserve the unity of world Jewry. This is an important component of Israel’s strength.”
0~11 Killed in Synagogue Massacre; Suspect Charged With 29 Counts~PITTSBURGH — Armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and at least three handguns, a man shouting anti-Semitic slurs opened fire inside a Pittsburgh synagogue Saturday morning, killing at least 11 congregants and wounding four police officers and two others, the authorities said. In a rampage described as among the deadliest against the Jewish community in the United States, the assailant stormed into the Tree of Life Congregation, where worshipers had gathered in separate rooms to celebrate their faith, and shot indiscriminately into the crowd, shattering what had otherwise been a peaceful morning. The assailant, identified by law enforcement officials as Robert D. Bowers, fired for several minutes and was leaving the synagogue when officers, dressed in tactical gear and armed with rifles, met him at the door. According to the police, Mr. Bowers exchanged gunfire with officers before retreating back inside and barricading himself inside a third-floor room. He eventually surrendered. Mr. Bowers, 46, was injured by gunfire, although the authorities said it was unclear whether those wounds were self-inflicted or whether the police had shot him. He was taken to Allegheny General Hospital. Federal officials charged Mr. Bowers with 29 criminal counts. They included obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs — a hate crime — and using a firearm to commit murder. He also faces state charges, including 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of aggravated assault and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation. The authorities said that he had no previous criminal history. [Read more about the shooting suspect, who frequently reposted anti-Semitic content on social media.] Though a bris, a ceremony to mark a child’s birth, was among the ceremonies taking place Saturday, no children were among the casualties, law enforcement officials said. The wounded included a 70-year-old man who had been shot in the torso, and a 61-year-old woman with soft tissue wounds, said Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. The attack Saturday morning struck the heart of the city’s vibrant Jewish community, in the leafy Squirrel Hill neighborhood that is home to several synagogues, kosher restaurants and bakeries. Hours later, hundreds gathered at three separate interfaith vigils on a cold, rainy evening to mourn the dead and pray for the wounded. The assault on the synagogue unfolded on a quiet, drizzly morning, and came amid a bitter, vitriolic midterm election season and against the backdrop of what appears to be a surge in hate-related speech and crimes across America. It also took place in the wake of the arrest Friday morning of a man who the authorities said sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to critics of Mr. Trump, including several high-profile Democrats.
0~Obituary: Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s Enigmatic Strongman~Ms. Albright met Mr. Kim in October 2000 in what turned out to be a futile effort to strike a deal with North Korea over limiting its missile program before President Bill Clinton left office. “There was no denying the dictatorial state that he ruled,” Ms. Sherman said. “There was no denying the freedoms that didn’t exist. But at the time, there were a lot of questions in the U.S. about whether he was really in control, and we left with no doubt that he was.” When Ms. Albright and Ms. Sherman sat down to talk through a 14-point list of concerns about North Korea’s missile program, “he didn’t know the answers to every question, but he knew a lot more than most leaders would — and he was a conceptual thinker,” Ms. Sherman added. A Deal With Washington President Bush said during his first term in office that he would never tolerate a nuclear North Korea, but as his presidency wound down, many of his aides believed he did exactly that. It was not until the spring of 2007 that Mr. Bush was told by the Israelis that North Korea was helping Syria build a nuclear reactor; before the Syrians or the North Koreans were confronted with that evidence, Israel sent bombers on a secret mission to destroy the Syrian plant. The North Koreans have never explained their role. By the time Mr. Bush left office, the administration had moved from four years of confrontation with the North to three years of halting negotiations. Led by Christopher R. Hill, a veteran American diplomat, the negotiations resulted in a deal that hawks hated: the United States agreed to supply North Korea with large amounts of fuel oil in return for the dismantlement of the aging Yongbyon plant, described by inspectors as a radioactive accident waiting to happen. Mr. Kim played a weak hand very well. He succeeded in fending off pressure from Washington and Beijing, and forcing Washington to talk with him and ultimately to haggle with him. He chopped up and dragged out negotiations, holding on to his nuclear fuel and whatever weapons he had produced, giving him continued leverage. It is that arsenal that now worries American and Asian officials, who fear that plotting generals and party leaders may fight to control it as they pick Mr. Kim’s successor.

0~In Battle Against Trash and Rats, N.Y.C. Officials Try a Schedule Shift~“Customers complain because it smells like trash and rodents are running around,” said Ms. Jeffrey, who was skeptical that the new plan would help. “Sometimes I try to move people inside, but sometimes they just leave.” Sanitation officials believe New Yorkers have been depositing their trash on the curb in bags starting at 4 p.m. since around 1971 when the city stopped requiring the use of metal trash cans. Officials are unsure of why 4 p.m. was chosen, but New York has become an outlier among major cities for how early it allows trash to be placed for pickup. According to a survey by the Sanitation Department, Toronto, San Francisco and St. Louis all allow trash to be put out at 6 p.m. or later. In Barcelona, Spain, trash is placed out after 8 p.m. and in Buenos Aires, residents can put trash out at 7 p.m. New York is one of the few major cities in the country that does not require trash to be set out in receptacles. The city recently launched a study on trash containerization that should be completed in a few months. As the city experiments with containerization, expands organics collection and how commercial waste is removed, an interim step is needed, said Sandy Nurse, a councilwoman from Brooklyn who is chairwoman of the sanitation committee. “We’re the only major city in the country that manages our residential trash in the way that we do,” Ms. Nurse said. “We have bags filled with food that sit out all night and well into the morning that are ripped open by rats. It doesn’t make any sense.”
0~India Revokes Kashmir’s Special Status, Raising Fears of Unrest~NEW DELHI — India’s Hindu nationalist government on Monday unilaterally wiped out the autonomy of the restive Kashmir region, sending in thousands of army troops to quell any possible unrest the move would bring in a disputed territory fought over by India and Pakistan. Government authorities severed internet connections, mobile phone lines and even land lines, casting Kashmir into an information black hole that made it very difficult to discern what was unfolding. For years, India’s Hindu nationalists have wanted to curtail the special freedoms enjoyed by Kashmir, a mountainous, predominantly Muslim territory that has turned into a tinderbox between India and Pakistan, both of which wield nuclear arms. On Monday, Amit Shah, India’s home minister, announced in a quick speech, which belied years of steady plotting, that the central government was removing the special, somewhat autonomous status that served as the foundation for Kashmir joining India more than 70 years ago.

Organized with the fashion company to recognize achievement in contemporary art, the prize comes with a $100,000 honorarium as well as a solo exhibition next year. Combining elements of documentary, portraiture and stagecraft, Ms. Lawson, 41, uses the body and domestic environments to explore themes of family, identity and community.
0~Leonardo da Vinci Painting Sells for $450.3 Million, Shattering Auction Highs~There was a palpable air of anticipation at Christie’s Rockefeller Center headquarters as the art market’s major players filed into the sales room. The capacity crowd included top dealers like Larry Gagosian, David Zwirner and Marc Payot of Hauser & Wirth. Major collectors had traveled here for the sale, among them Eli Broad and Michael Ovitz from Los Angeles; Martin Margulies from Miami; and Stefan Edlis from Chicago. Christie’s had produced special red paddles for those bidding on the Leonardo, and many of its specialists taking bids on the phone wore elegant black. Earlier, 27,000 people had lined up at pre-auction viewings in Hong Kong, London, San Francisco and New York to glimpse the painting of Christ as “Savior of the World.” Members of the public — indeed, even many cognoscenti — cared little if at all whether the painting might have been executed in part by studio assistants; whether Leonardo had actually made the work himself; or how much of the canvas had been repainted and restored. They just wanted to see a masterwork that dates from about 1500 and was rediscovered in 2005. “There is extraordinary consensus it is by Leonardo,” said Nicholas Hall, the former co-chairman of old master paintings at Christie’s, who now runs his own Manhattan gallery. “This is the most important old master painting to have been sold at auction in my lifetime.” That is the kind of name-brand appeal that Christie’s was presumably banking on by placing the painting in its high-profile contemporary art sale, rather than in its less sexy annual old master auction, where it technically belongs. To some extent, the auction house succeeded with the painting even before the sale, having secured a guaranteed $100 million bid from an unidentified third party. It is the 12th artwork to break the $100 million mark at auction, and a new high for any old master at auction, surpassing Rubens’s “Massacre of the Innocents,” which sold for $76.7 million in 2002 (or more than $105 million, adjusted for inflation). But many art experts argue that Christie’s used marketing window dressing to mask the baggage that comes with the Leonardo, from its compromised condition to its complicated buying history and said that the auction house put the artwork in a contemporary sale to circumvent the scrutiny of old masters experts, many of whom have questioned the painting’s authenticity and condition. “The composition doesn’t come from Leonardo,” said Jacques Franck, a Paris-based art historian and Leonardo specialist. “He preferred twisted movement. It’s a good studio work with a little Leonardo at best, and it’s very damaged.”
0~Paul Coverdell, 61, Dies; Influential Senator From Georgia~The state's Democratic senator, Max Cleland, said the two possible candidates for the interim position would be Michael Coles, the Democratic cookie magnate who lost to Mr. Coverdell in the 1998 election, and a former Democratic representative, Buddy Darden. Mr. Barnes seemed unlikely to offer himself for the Senate since he was elected only two years ago. Mr. Cleland, who was sworn into the Georgia State Senate on the same day with Mr. Coverdell 30 years, expressed his respect for his former colleague. ''He never showed a trace of personal ego or animosity,'' Mr. Cleland said. ''He loved public service, he loved politics and he loved to contribute.'' As the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate, Mr. Coverdell held the title of secretary of the conference. But he was expected to move up the ladder to conference chairmanship with the retirement this fall of Senator Connie Mack of Florida. As secretary, Mr. Coverdell essentially ran the marketing department for Senate Republicans, putting his organizational prowess to work in shaping the party's message in five areas: education, taxes, Social Security, defense and drug prevention. In the Senate, Mr. Coverdell's interests and expertise ranged broadly. He championed education savings accounts, a signature Republican issue. He was a chief backer of a $1.3 billion aid package to help Colombia combat drug traffickers protected by rebel insurgents in the South American nation. Senator Coverdell was first elected to the Senate in 1992, squeaking out a victory over the liberal Democratic incumbent, Wyche Fowler Jr. He won again in 1998, despite concerns about his political vulnerability, much of it fueled by his low-key, behind-the-scenes style of getting things done. And in a chamber bulging with oversized egos, Mr. Coverdell relished his image as an quiet insider. ''He was a humble man who brought to the public discourse good ideas and common-sense solutions,'' Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said in a statement. ''He didn't care who received the credit.''
0~How the Olympics Hurt Tokyo's Economy~But as Tokyo fired up its cranes and cement mixers, the official cost skyrocketed to $14.9 billion from $7.3 billion. The one-year pandemic delay drove costs 20 percent higher, according to a government report. But those figures probably still don’t represent the true cost: A government audit conducted before the pandemic had already put the real price at $27 billion. The economic forecasts, too, began to look shaky. Official estimates suggested that the event and its legacy effects would create nearly two million jobs and add more than $128 billion to the economy from investment, tourism and increased consumption. But “those numbers were really big — with or without Covid-19, that would not have happened,” said Sayuri Shirai, an economics professor at Keio University in Tokyo and a former member of the Bank of Japan’s board. (The Games have a history of overpromising no matter where they are held.) When the pandemic hit, many of the Olympics investments changed from black ink to red. Tokyo 2020 had tripled the record for domestic corporate sponsorships, raking in more than $3.6 billion for the organizers. But many of those partners then decided that — at least at home — they would distance themselves from the event. Days before the opening ceremony, Toyota, one of Japan’s most powerful companies, announced that it would not air its Olympic ads in the domestic market and that its chairman would not attend the event. Other sponsors followed suit. (Local media had reported that Toyota spent $1.6 billion for a 10-year Olympic sponsorship deal. Toyota declined to comment.) The losses are a rounding error for Japan’s enormous economy. But the smaller businesses along the thoroughfares and winding alleys of Tokyo may never recover.

In the absence of such a concerted appeal from the president, many voters appear to have sunk into a state of glum pessimism. In both Virginia and New Jersey, polls consistently found that large majorities believed the country was on the wrong track, even though most American adults were now vaccinated and schools had reopened. Now, Democratic officials say, the party must do more to address head-on the electorate’s deep malaise or risk watching voters lurch back toward the G.O.P. by default. “People are fatigued and confused, and they want to get back to their normal lives, whatever that might be,” said Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator in New Jersey. “They want their schools open, and they want their health care protected, and they want to have an option of working and operating businesses.” Ms. Weinberg, a longtime party leader, said Democrats had not sufficiently reckoned with the demoralizing effects of the coronavirus pandemic. On the right, she said, there were “horrendous and hateful” attitudes toward state officials who battled the disease. But there was not equal and opposite political engagement among Democrats. “We are a high-property-taxes, very densely populated, very diverse state, with all of the problems of people living close together during a time of a pandemic — tough decisions of closing schools and closing down the economy,” she said. “And it all came back to roost.” In Virginia, Representative Donald McEachin said voters were chafing to “return to normal as quickly as possible,” and he urged his fellow Democrats to speak directly to that impatience.
0~How Ukraine Negotiated With the Taliban and Rescued 96 Afghans~For the Ukrainians, it was a crash course in dealing with a Taliban government struggling with internal division, bureaucratic chaos and a barely controlled inclination for violence. For days, the Taliban refused to release the people the Ukrainians hoped to rescue, repeatedly changing the terms of the evacuation deal, demanding official recognition from the Ukrainian government, and at one point threatening to commandeer the plane. But on Thursday, finally, the Afghans stepped out into a blustery autumn night in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, following a flight that became an unexpected lifeline after many had given up hope of escape. “I’ve been waiting for evacuation for a month and a half, but my family and I could never make it through,” said Kharimi, 38, who had arrived in Kyiv with six family members, including a small daughter he hopes will now have a chance at a future. “First Ukraine, then God listened to our prayers.” The New York Times is referring to the Afghan evacuees by only their first names to protect their identities. In the first weeks after Kabul fell to the Taliban on Aug. 15, a coalition of nations conducted a colossal, if often haphazard, airlift to extract tens of thousands Afghans suddenly in grave danger because of their work for foreign governments or Afghan security services. But without the U.S. security blanket — the last American C-17 cargo planes left at the end of August — few countries have been willing to hazard their planes and their people to continue evacuations, leaving thousands of at-risk Afghans with few options for escape.
0~On Day 3 of Delays, New Jersey Transit’s Shortfalls Are Painfully Clear~For the third day in a row, electrical problems in century-old rail tunnels under the Hudson River on Wednesday stymied the commutes of tens of thousands of New Jersey Transit riders, illustrating again the shortcomings of the region’s languishing infrastructure system. The delays, coming a week after the board of New Jersey Transit approved a major fare increase, created chaos during the morning rush and gave rise to another round of questions about Gov. Chris Christie’s decision five years ago to halt construction of a new rail tunnel. Commuters, many of whom have grown inured to grinding delays and overflowing platforms, lashed out on Wednesday, blaming the transit agency for their being habitually late to work and criticizing Mr. Christie for failing to find a solution to the state’s drained transportation fund. The deteriorating tunnels are a chokepoint for rail traffic from Boston to Washington, the busiest railroad corridor in the United States, and serve as the central artery for New Jersey Transit, one of the nation’s largest providers of commuting services. Transit advocates said that this week’s breakdowns, far from being an anomaly, laid bare the paralyzing effects of disruptions that could become common in the absence of quick action.
0~Wall Street Sees a Record Deal Spree as a Reason for Optimism~The dealmakers at the nation’s biggest banks are the busiest they’ve ever been. Interest rates are low, private equity firms flush with cash are looking for promising investments, and companies are aggressively pursuing mergers at a breakneck pace. Wall Street banks announced blockbuster quarterly profits this week from a record wave of transactions that shows no signs of ebbing: Even in the face of surging inflation and shaky consumer sentiment, corporate clients are ready to deal — and bank leaders say that’s a reason to be optimistic about the economic recovery. “Whenever C.E.O. confidence is high, M&A activity increases,” David M. Solomon, Goldman Sachs’s chief executive, said in an interview Friday after the bank reported third-quarter earnings of $5.38 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts. “The world’s resettled a bit coming out of the pandemic, and that is now giving a lot of companies an opportunity to really take note of where they want to go.” A record $1.6 trillion in mergers and purchases were struck worldwide in the quarter, according to a research report from Refinitiv. That, in turn, set records for advisory businesses across Wall Street: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley tallied record revenues, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America announced all-time high fees, and Citigroup’s mergers and acquisitions bankers had their best quarter in a decade. Goldman Sachs has already had the most profitable year in its history — earning $17.7 billion so far — with three months to go. In the most recent quarter, its bankers closed transactions including the $32 billion spinoff of Universal Music Group by the French conglomerate Vivendi and Salesforce.com’s $28.1 billion purchase of Slack Technologies. Those were two of the 10 biggest deals completed in the three-month period ending in September, according to Dealogic. Morgan Stanley also had two top-10 deals: the chip maker Analog Devices’s $20 billion acquisition of a competitor, Maxim Integrated, and the $12.3 billion purchase of Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company, by the private equity firm Thoma Bravo.
0~Mueller Will Accept Some Written Answers From Trump~The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, eased up slightly on his demands to question President Trump in the Russia investigation, a shift that came as the president’s lawyers, who have advised him against sitting for an interview, are fighting his desire to answer investigators’ queries. Mr. Mueller will accept written answers from Mr. Trump on questions about whether his campaign conspired with Russia’s election interference, Mr. Mueller’s office told the president’s lawyers in a letter, two people briefed on it said on Tuesday. On another significant aspect of the investigation — whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry itself — Mr. Mueller and his investigators understood that issues of executive privilege could complicate their pursuit of a presidential interview and did not ask for written responses on that matter, according to the letter, which was sent on Friday. Mr. Mueller did not say that he was giving up on an interview altogether, including on questions of obstruction of justice. But the tone of the letter and the fact that the special counsel did not ask for written responses on obstruction prompted some Trump allies to conclude that if an interview takes place, its scope will be more limited than Mr. Trump’s legal team initially believed, the people said.
0~Trump’s Covid-19 Symptoms Are Said to Be ‘Very Concerning’~The inconsistencies and confusion may presage an unsettling period for the president and the country. As the doctors indicated, it may be a week to 10 days before the course of Mr. Trump’s illness becomes clear, leaving America, as well as its allies and adversaries, guessing about the leadership in the world’s only superpower in the final days of a momentous election campaign. White House officials sought to project as much of a business-as-usual image as possible, insisting that the president could govern from his hospital bed and that there was no need to transfer power to Vice President Mike Pence. Even as doctors hovered over Mr. Trump, his staff on Friday night and Saturday issued a report on his buy-American drive, announced some minor appointments and released a proclamation on Fire Prevention Week. But in reality, Mr. Trump has had difficult and even scary moments since being diagnosed with the virus that has killed more than 208,000 in the United States so far. Two people close to the White House said in separate interviews with The New York Times that the president had had trouble breathing on Friday and that his oxygen level had dropped, prompting his doctors to give him supplemental oxygen while he was at the White House and to transfer him to Walter Reed, where he could be monitored with better equipment and treated more rapidly in case of trouble. During the televised briefing on Saturday, Dr. Sean P. Conley, the White House physician, said the president was not currently receiving supplemental oxygen on Saturday but repeatedly declined to say definitively whether he had ever been on oxygen. “None at this moment, and yesterday with the team, while we were all here, he was not on oxygen,” he said, seeming to suggest that there had been a period on Friday at the White House when he was. Dr. Conley likewise appeared to indicate that the president had first been diagnosed with the virus on Wednesday rather than late Thursday night before Mr. Trump disclosed the test on Twitter early Friday morning. While describing what he said was the president’s progress, he said Mr. Trump was “just 72 hours into the diagnosis now,” which would mean midday on Wednesday. How Times reporters cover politics.

0~Amid Nuclear Tensions, Trump Mulls Exit From South Korea Trade Deal~WASHINGTON — President Trump is considering pulling out of a major trade agreement with South Korea as he tries to fulfill get-tough campaign pledges on international trade. But he has not yet made a final decision, two senior administration officials said Saturday. The president’s top economic advisers remain deeply divided over a possible withdrawal from the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, as negotiators from both countries struggle to rewrite the five-year-old deal. The debate comes as the United States and South Korea are working together to try to combat a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, which said on Sunday that it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. It is a more powerful weapon than the atomic bomb it had tested in the past. In recent days, a frustrated Mr. Trump has pushed his staff to take bold action against a host of governments, including the one in Seoul, that he has accused of unfair trade practices. But many of his more moderate advisers, including the chairman of the National Economic Council, Gary D. Cohn, believe that such a move could prompt a trade war that could hurt the United States economy.
0~UK Increasingly Isolated as US Restricts Travel Due to Coronavirus~Nonessential travel will also be banned within much of Britain starting on Saturday. Despite the restrictions, there is concern that the variant, which mounting scientific evidence indicates is more contagious, is probably spreading far more widely than previously known. And because few countries use the level of genomic surveillance that Britain does, it could have already been spreading undetected for weeks. A woman who flew into Germany on Sunday — hours before the country put in place its travel ban — tested positive for the variant, German health officials said on Thursday. It was the first case identified in the country, but because the variant has been spreading since at least September, experts said it was probably not the first case there. Singapore also announced that it had detected a case on Thursday. And Denmark, which has wider genomic surveillance than many other countries, detected 33 cases of the variant between Nov. 14 and Dec. 14, according to the Danish health authorities. The concern about the variant that led to bans on travel also prompted France to blockade the English Channel for 48 hours. Although that order was lifted on Wednesday, a subsequent push to testing thousands of drivers for the virus as a condition to enter France has proved a logistical nightmare. By Thursday, the transportation secretary, Grant Shapps, said that of the 2,367 drivers tested, three were positive. Thousands more remain to be tested. Britain’s military has sent an additional 800 soldiers to assist the 300 already there to aid health workers conducting the screenings.
0~Spanish Court Moves to Pre-empt Catalan Independence Declaration~BARCELONA, Spain — Spain’s constitutional court on Thursday suspended a session of the Catalan regional Parliament scheduled for next week in which lawmakers were expected to approve a unilateral declaration of independence. The court’s decision heightened the conflict over Catalonia, which held a referendum on independence last Sunday that the Spanish courts had declared illegal and ordered suspended. The central government in Madrid sent thousands of police officers to block the vote, and hundreds of people were wounded in the clashes. The crisis has become one of the most serious tests of Spain’s Constitution and territorial integrity since the country embraced democracy in the 1970s. Catalan separatists say they are entitled to an independent state because of the region’s distinct language and culture. They say the referendum lent further legitimacy to their claim, even though fewer than half of all eligible voters went to the polls.
0~To Talk With Hamas, U.S. Needs Help From a Testy Trio of Nations~CAIRO — As Secretary of State John Kerry arrived here Monday night to try to produce a cease-fire in the Gaza crisis as rapidly as possible, he confronted an uncomfortable reality. The United States must rely heavily on Egypt, Qatar and Turkey to play intermediary and exert their influence, because it has no direct contact and little leverage with the militant group Hamas. Those countries, however, have their own deep-seated differences over Hamas. While Egypt has been opposed to Hamas and other Islamic movements, Turkey has been supportive. Qatar, for its part, has provided financial assistance to Hamas and also a base of operations for Khalid Meshal, the group’s political leader. “It will be extremely difficult for the United States to bring Egypt, Turkey and Qatar together right now,” said Robert M. Danin, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior State Department official.
0~#MeToo Brought Down 201 Powerful Men. Nearly Half of Their Replacements Are Women.~201 lost jobs or major roles 124 replacements: 54 women and 70 men Who Was Ousted and Who Stepped In Harvey Weinstein Producer and co-founder, the Weinstein Company Interim Andy Mitchell & Milos Brajovic Co-presidents of Lantern Entertainment Charlie Rose Television host Permanent Christiane Amanpour Host, “Amanpour & Company” ▼ View all 201 cases below They had often gotten away with it for years, and for those they harassed, it seemed as if the perpetrators would never pay any consequences. Then came the report that detailed Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assaults and harassment, and his fall from Hollywood’s heights. A year later, even as the #MeToo movement meets a crackling backlash, it’s possible to take some stock of how the Weinstein case has changed the corridors of power. A New York Times analysis has found that, since the publishing of the exposé (followed days later by a New Yorker investigation), at least 200 prominent men have lost their jobs after public allegations of sexual harassment. A few, including Mr. Weinstein, face criminal charges. At least 920 people came forward to say that one of these men subjected them to sexual misconduct. And nearly half of the men who have been replaced were succeeded by women. In the year preceding the Weinstein report, by contrast, fewer than 30 high-profile people made the news for resigning or being fired after public accusations of sexual misconduct. The downfall of the Fox host Bill O'Reilly in April 2017 turned out to have been just a foreshock of the changes to come. “We’ve never seen something like this before,” said Joan Williams, a law professor who studies gender at the University of California, Hastings. “Women have always been seen as risky, because they might do something like have a baby. But men are now being seen as more risky hires.” [Sign up here for Gender Letter, our newsletter that helps you keep up with the world, and the women shaping it.] Sexual harassment has hardly been erased in the workplace. Federal law still does not fully protect huge groups of women, including those who work freelance or at companies with fewer than 15 employees. New workplace policies have little effect without deeper cultural change. And as the Supreme Court confirmation battle over Brett Kavanaugh showed, Americans disagree on how people accused of sexual misconduct should be held accountable and what the standard of evidence should be. But the analysis shows that the #MeToo movement shook, and is still shaking, power structures in society’s most visible sectors. The Times gathered cases of prominent people who lost their main jobs, significant leadership positions or major contracts, and whose ousters were publicly covered in news reports. Forty-three percent of their replacements were women. Of those, one-third are in news media, one-quarter in government, and one-fifth in entertainment and the arts. For example, Robin Wright replaced Kevin Spacey as lead actor on “House of Cards,” Emily Nemens replaced Lorin Stein as editor of “The Paris Review,” and Tina Smith replaced Al Franken as a senator from Minnesota. People Replacing Men Accused of Sexual Misconduct Women are starting to gain power in organizations that have been jolted by harassment, with potentially far-reaching effects. “I find it so interesting the number of people who come up to me and say, ‘Thank you for stepping in when someone needed to step in,’” Ms. Smith said. “That’s a lot of what women do a lot of the time, right?” Appointing a woman does not guarantee change. Women have also harassed and covered up harassment. Some women face the glass cliff — in which women are appointed to leadership in times of organizational crisis, when the chance of failure is higher. And while the share of women who have risen to power in the wake of Mr. Weinstein’s fall is significant, women are still vastly underrepresented at the top of American institutions. Research has repeatedly shown that women tend to lead differently. In general, they create more respectful work environments, where harassment is less likely to flourish and where women feel more comfortable reporting it. Female leaders tend to hire and promote more women; pay them more equally; and make companies more profitable. Women bring their life experiences and perspectives to decision-making, and that can help in business because women make the vast majority of purchasing decisions. In government, women have been shown to be more collaborative and bipartisan, and promote more policies supporting women, children and social welfare. That has been true in Congress, said Ms. Smith, a Democrat. In a highly polarized Senate, women tend to be unusually collegial across party lines, she said, and the 23 female senators meet for dinner monthly. Al Franken U.S. senator for Minnesota Resigned after accusations of groping and improper advances from at least six women. He apologized but denied many of the allegations. Interim Tina Smith ▼ View all 201 cases below “I believe you’re successful and you get things done if you have relationships with people,” she said. “That’s the ground for accomplishing something, certainly in the legislative world.” One example: She and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska, discovered that they both worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in high school. The bond they built from shared experience helped them when they co-sponsored mental health legislation that was included in the opioid crisis response bill passed last month. In news media and entertainment, many women who ascended to jobs vacated by men have changed the tone and substance of what they offer audiences — and in some cases, the fallout from #MeToo has shaped their decisions. Roy Price Head of Amazon Studios Resigned after a Hollywood producer accused him of making unwanted sexual advances. Interim Albert Cheng Permanent Jennifer Salke ▼ View all 201 cases below Jennifer Salke, who took over for Roy Price as head of Amazon Studios, has said Amazon needed more “big, addictive shows for women.” She has announced deals with the actors Lena Waithe and Nicole Kidman, among others. Since Tanzina Vega took over from John Hockenberry as host of “The Takeaway,” the public radio program, she has done many episodes about gender, including on masculinity, women’s anger and the intersection of gender and race — topics that she had been covering for years but that she said were now part of the national conversation. “I don’t think that’s necessarily because I’m a woman, but it’s just that as a woman, as a Latina, I know when the conversation hasn’t been about women, and I’m deeply sensitive to that,” said Ms. Vega, who was previously a reporter at CNN and The New York Times. John Hockenberry Host of WNYC’s “The Takeaway” After he left “The Takeaway,” nine women accused Mr. Hockenberry of sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances. He apologized, describing his behavior as “rude, aggressive and impolite.” Interim Todd Zwillich Permanent Tanzina Vega Amy Walter Friday host ▼ View all 201 cases below Women’s personal experiences, including as mothers, can make workplaces more welcoming to other women. That’s the hope of Christine Tsai, who is chief executive of the tech investment firm 500 Startups, where she replaced Dave McClure in early 2017 after an internal investigation into his behavior toward women in the tech community. “I’ve erred on the side as C.E.O. of being more open about it, like if one of my kids has an appointment, so hopefully it creates an environment where people don’t feel like they have to hide that they have obligations to family,” she said. “Sure, a guy can be sensitive to those things, but I think it helps having that empathy of what it’s like for moms.” The women who have risen, however, can only make so much change — they are still operating in a male-dominated system. More than 10 percent of the ousted men have tried to make a comeback, or voiced a desire to, and many never lost financial power. The comedian Louis C.K. recently took the stage at the Comedy Cellar in New York, raising questions of how long is long enough for people to be banished from their field, and who gets to decide. Garrison Keillor, the radio host, has restarted “The Writer’s Almanac” as a podcast and reportedly received $275,000 for a deal in which Minnesota Public Radio reposted archived episodes of his programs. Jerry Richardson, the founder and former owner of the Carolina Panthers, was fined $2.75 million by the N.F.L. after he was accused of sexual harassment — but sold the team for at least $2.2 billion, a record amount. When people accused of harassment return to power without making amends — or never lose it, at least financially — it limits the post-Weinstein movement’s potential to change how power is exercised in American society. They have not experienced the same type of trauma that survivors have, said Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, which she started in 2006 to support survivors of sexual harassment and violence (the hashtag went viral a year ago this month as women used it to tell their stories of harassment and violence). And very few have shown that they have taken responsibility for their actions or offered private apologies to those they harmed, she said. “Where’s the self-reflection and accountability?” she said. “Perhaps if we saw some evidence of that, then we can have a more robust conversation about the road to redemption.” In the meantime, these women say, there are more than enough qualified women ready to take their places in power. “A bunch of us who took over these jobs got promoted because we were really good at these jobs,” said Ms. Vega, the radio host. “We have the skills, we have the experience, we have the work ethic and we have the smarts to do it, and it’s time for us to do this job.” The 98 Men Who Were Replaced Of the men who lost their jobs, 51 have been replaced by at least one woman in an interim or permanent capacity. The date for each entry indicates when news broke of accusations, or when a firing, resignation or other fallout was announced.

0~Links Between Charity and Senator Malcolm A. Smith’s Staff~This article is by Nicholas Confessore, William K. Rashbaum and Ray Rivera. Four current or former officials of a Queens nonprofit group or a related charity founded by State Senator Malcolm A. Smith and Congressman Gregory W. Meeks — a group to which Mr. Smith has directed some $56,000 in state funds — have spent some time on the Senate payroll working for Mr. Smith, and two were among his highest paid staff members, public records show. Federal prosecutors are investigating the nonprofit group, the New Direction Local Development Corporation, and a related charity set up to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina, and they issued a subpoena at the beginning of February for records from Mr. Smith’s Senate office that show all the money he had directed to community groups over the past decade, a person with knowledge of the subpoena said last week. But while the prosecutors who issued the subpoena, from the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, wrote it broadly, the person said that investigators made clear that they were focused on New Direction, which was incorporated in 2000 and says in its tax filings that it was created to encourage local development in Southeast Queens. Senator Smith, through a Senate spokesman, Austin Shafran, denied wrongdoing on Sunday. “Senator Smith’s integrity, compassion, and respect for his office have never been questioned,” Mr. Shafran said.
0~Video Investigation: How Rayshard Brooks Was Fatally Shot by Atlanta Police~On Friday night, June 12, an employee at a Wendy’s restaurant in South Atlanta calls 911. A 27-year-old man named Rayshard Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane. Soon, two police officers respond. They and Mr. Brooks speak calmly and cordially for 41 minutes. “That was it.” But then in just 45 seconds, one of the officers fatally shoots Mr. Brooks as he is running away. [gunshots] How could a routine police response go so suddenly and horribly wrong? The Times examined witness videos, security footage, police body-cam and dash-cam videos. We synchronized and slowed down those videos so we can see and hear what unfolded. We reviewed police records, and procedures, and statements made by the officers involved. And we identified the critical moments and missteps that led to a young man losing his life. It’s 10:41 p.m., eight minutes after the 911 call when Officer Devin Brosnan arrives at Wendy’s. He raps on Brooks’s car window and wakes him up. Brooks appears groggy and disoriented. [beeping] Brosnan, who joined the Atlanta Police Department last year, talks to Brooks and then requests an officer who can perform sobriety tests. At 10:55 p.m., Officer Garrett Rolfe arrives. [beeping] Rolfe joined the Atlanta Police Force in 2013, and is an experienced D.U.I. investigator. Rolfe has once been reprimanded for firing his service weapon, police records show. He takes charge of the investigation. Rolfe begins to question Brooks, who is confused about where he is. He seems to think he’s six miles down the road near a Home Lodge Hotel. There’s another Wendy’s right beside it. At 11:02 p.m., Rolfe asks Brooks to get out of the car. Moments later, Brooks will also consent to a series of sobriety tests. Brooks is clearly inebriated. But he’s compliant and friendly throughout this time. The officers are courteous. And Rolfe gives him clear and precise instructions. When Rolfe now asks Brooks if he’ll take a breathalyzer test, Brooks hesitates at first. Brooks offers to go to his sister’s house. Why did Brooks want to resolve his situation without being arrested? According to court records, he was on probation for domestic violence and theft offenses. He was probably aware that a new arrest or conviction would almost certainly send him back to prison. The breathalyzer returns a blood alcohol reading of .108 percent, above the legal limit of .08 percent. Rolfe has little option now but to charge Brooks with D.U.I. Some policing experts told us he could have written a citation and drove Brooks home. Others said police are expected to show zero tolerance with drunken driving. For 41 minutes, Brooks and the officers have spoken calmly and respectfully. They even shared a few laughs. Now, Rolfe moves to arrest Brooks. And in 45 seconds, he will fatally shoot him. [gunshots] [yelling] Let’s watch this back, and break down what happens. Rolfe has signaled or sought Brooks’s consent for every action to this point. But he moves to handcuff Brooks swiftly and without clearly telling him he’s under arrest. This breaches D.U.I. arrest procedures. Brooks resists, and the three tumble to the ground. Brosnan draws his Taser … … and pushes it into Brooks’s leg. Brooks grabs the Taser. Both officers’ body cameras fall to the ground. Brooks stands up and strikes Rolfe with an open hand. As Rolfe draws his Taser, Brooks fires a dart, hitting Brosnan’s arm. Rolfe fires the Taser twice … [yelling] … and hits Brooks’s body. We hear Rolfe using his Taser as he chases Brooks. This is a breach of police procedures. Rolfe passes the Taser to his left hand and reaches for his gun. Brooks looks behind and fires the Taser he’s holding. We confirmed these Taser models with the Atlanta Police. Once they’re fired twice, they must be reloaded. So at this point, Brooks is unarmed. Rolfe drops his Taser, draws his handgun and fires three times at Brooks, who is 18 feet away and is trying to escape in a busy Wendy’s parking lot. [gunshots] Two bullets hit Brooks in the back, one piercing his heart. A third bullet hits this Chevrolet Trailblazer, which had three passengers in it. This photo from the Fulton County District Attorney shows the bullet hole. No one in the car was injured. Rolfe shouts at Brooks … ... and appears to kick him on the ground. This image, also provided by the Fulton County D.A., shows that moment more clearly. Officer Brosnan approaches and briefly stands on Brooks’s shoulder. [yelling] Meanwhile, witnesses denounce the shooting. The officers stand over Brooks for about a minute before Rolfe runs back to his vehicle to get his medical kit. Brosnan continues to stand by. It’s over two minutes before Brooks receives medical assistance. “Every fucking time!” Rolfe administers CPR until emergency services take over. At 11:39 p.m., 15 minutes after he’s shot, an ambulance takes Rayshard Brooks to a hospital where he is later announced dead. Was Rolfe justified in shooting a man holding a Taser, and who was trying to escape? Police procedures on the use of deadly force state that an officer must reasonably believe the suspect possesses a deadly weapon, and that the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious bodily injury to the officer or others. In a statement made through his lawyer, Officer Rolfe said he did use reasonable force because he “heard a sound like a gunshot” and fearing for his safety and the safety of others, he “fired” his weapon. The description of a gunshot doesn’t square with what Rolfe told investigating police at the scene. And minutes before this, Rolfe appears to have been aware that Brooks fired the Taser twice. This and other evidence will be scrutinized in what has now become a homicide investigation. Rolfe has been charged on 11 counts, including felony murder, and both officers with aggravated assault.
0~Australia Scraps Covid-19 Vaccine That Produced H.I.V. False Positives~Australia on Friday canceled a roughly $750 million plan for a large order of a locally developed coronavirus vaccine after the inoculation produced false positive test results for H.I.V. in some volunteers participating in a trial study. Of the dozens of coronavirus vaccines being tested worldwide, the Australian one was the first to be abandoned. While its developers said the experimental vaccine had appeared to be safe and effective, the false positives risked undermining trust in the effort to vaccinate the public. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday said that his government would compensate for the loss of 51 million doses it had planned to buy from the Australian consortium in part by increasing orders of vaccines made by AstraZeneca and Novavax. The government has said it plans to begin inoculating citizens by March. “We can’t have any issues with confidence,” he told reporters, “and we are as a nation now, with a good portfolio of vaccines, able to make these decisions to best protect the Australian people.”
0~I.R.S. Commissioner John Koskinen, on Hot Seat, Has History of Bureaucratic Rescue Jobs~WASHINGTON — It was clear from the start that John Koskinen, the new commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, was in for a long night. At a Capitol Hill hearing, Republican members of Congress pressed him about emails missing from the hard drive of Lois Lerner, a former agency official at the center of a scandal over the scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status. They wanted to know if he had any evidence that a crime was committed in the destruction of the messages. Mr. Koskinen seemed fed up. “I have no evidence whether she beat her dog, whether she beat children,” he told them, his voice rising. “I have no evidence of a whole series of things.” For nearly four hours at the June 23 hearing, Mr. Koskinen, a Yale-trained lawyer who says he gave up practicing law for Lent one year and never looked back, absorbed cascades of verbal salvos and tossed back several of his own. Hired to rehabilitate an agency that went awry targeting political groups, Mr. Koskinen’s style — quick-witted to the point of being flip and sometimes impolitic — has left some wondering if he is the right person to restore the I.R.S.’s battered credibility.
0~A Red-Meat Rallying Cry for National Republicans: California~LAS VEGAS — Adam Laxalt, the Republican candidate for governor of Nevada, knows how to rile up a crowd this election season: Just point to the state to the west. “Are we going to keep Nevada the Nevada we all love, this independent Western state, or are we going to turn into California?” Mr. Laxalt asked at a rally in Elko with President Trump on Saturday. Mr. Trump jumped in a moment later, assailing California’s embrace of so-called sanctuary cities, where local authorities limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. “By the way, a lot of people in California don’t want them, either,” he said of such cities. “They’re rioting now.” (Actually, they are not). It’s not only in Nevada. California would seem to be on the ballot in a number of states where Republicans are facing tough re-election battles this fall. In Nevada, Texas, Colorado and Florida, California is being hoisted as a symbol of high taxes, liberal social policy, lax immigration enforcement and an interventionist government run amok. The state figures in laugh lines and attack lines wielded by candidates for the House and Senate, for governor and for state legislative seats.
0~Boom or Bust: Stark Partisan Divide on How Consumers View Economy~Economics has a foundation in hard numbers — employment, inflation, spending — that has largely allowed it to sidestep the competing partisan narratives that have afflicted American politics and culture. But not anymore. Since Donald J. Trump’s victory in November, consumer sentiment has diverged in an unprecedented way, with Republicans convinced that a boom is at hand, and Democrats foreseeing an imminent recession. “We’ve never recorded this before,” said Richard Curtin, who directs the University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumer sentiment. Although the outlook has occasionally varied by political party since the survey began in 1946, “the partisan divide has never had as large an impact on consumers’ economic expectations,” he said. At the same time, familiar economic data points have become Rorschach tests. That was evident after the government’s monthly jobs report on Friday; Republicans’ talking points centered on a 10-year low in the unemployment rate, while Democrats focused on a sharp decline in job creation.
0~Sinn Fein Refuses to Vote in British Parliament, Even Against Brexit~DUBLIN — With Westminster deadlocked over Britain’s departure from the European Union, one small party is potentially positioned to rescue Britain from its self-induced paralysis — but it refuses to vote. Having won seven seats on an anti-Brexit platform, the party’s support would have reversed Monday’s three-vote defeat for a proposal to keep the United Kingdom in the European Union’s customs union, ending the risk of a catastrophic no-deal Brexit. The party is Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army, which does not consider itself British and has formally renounced any involvement in Westminster politics. This week, despite renewed criticism in Ireland, Sinn Fein repeated that it has no intention of ending its Westminster boycott. “It’s a matter of principle. We are a party that is for a United Ireland, for Irish independence,” said the party’s president, Mary Lou McDonald, on Tuesday.
0~Tesla, Reporting Bigger Loss, Emphasizes Gains in Production and Sales~The electric-car maker Tesla said on Wednesday that its losses had widened in the first quarter, but that sales and revenues had grown rapidly as the company prepared for the critical launch of a mass-market model. The company said it lost $397 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $282 million in the same period a year earlier. But the automaker emphasized that production had increased by about 65 percent from last year’s first quarter, to 25,000 vehicles, and that revenue had more than doubled, to $2.7 billion. (The figure includes revenue from SolarCity, the solar-panel maker that Tesla merged with last year; automotive revenue alone was $2.3 billion.) The gains on the production side are being watched closely by investors and analysts who are seeking evidence that Tesla can meet its plans to begin manufacturing the Model 3, its first mass-market offering, this summer.
0~South Korea and U.S. Begin Drills as North Warns of Rising Tensions~SEOUL, South Korea — The United States and South Korea began their annual joint military exercises on Monday, while North Korea warned that the drills would deepen tensions on the Korean Peninsula by “throwing fuel onto fire.” Both the United States and South Korea insist that the drills are defensive in nature, but North Korea has long condemned the joint exercises as rehearsals for invasion. During such drills, North Korea has often escalated its warlike rhetoric and lashed out with missile and other weapons tests. It tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile during the drills in August last year, following it up with a nuclear test, its fifth, the next month. The exercises this week, known as Ulchi-Freedom Guardian, follow a North Korean threat this month to launch four ballistic missiles into waters near Guam, home to major American military bases in the Western Pacific. That warning, combined with another by President Trump to bring “fire and fury” to the North unless it stood down, has escalated tensions in the region, even setting off fears of possible war.
0~Parties and Covid-19 Outbreaks Threaten University Reopenings in the U.S.~Mr. Xi’s triumphant account would probably have drawn much wider skepticism in China earlier this year, when many people were angered by officials who understated the spread of infections in Wuhan, where the epidemic took off. But the public mood shifted as China emerged from the crisis far more smoothly than the United States and other advanced economies did. Near the start of Tuesday’s meeting, the thousands in the hall observed a minute or so of silence to mourn the thousands who died in China from the virus, including many medical workers. But online, Chinese people lamented the lack of mention of Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who was chastised by the police for alerting his colleagues to the then little-understood virus, and later died from Covid-19. “Dr. Li, I thought your name should have been at the award day ceremony,” said one of many similar comments on Dr. Li’s page on Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese social media service. Now China is trying to turn attention to economic recovery, and the government has chosen an unusual set of volunteers to test a coronavirus vaccine: its trade negotiators, who are more likely than most Chinese to interact with potentially infected foreigners. Chen Deming, a former commerce minister who is still active on trade issues, was maskless when he took the podium at an economic policy conference on Tuesday morning in Beijing. He drew laughter and applause when he began by saying, “The host doesn’t have to wear a mask because I’ve already had the Phase 3 trial vaccine shot.” Mr. Chen, a Communist Party elder statesman who turns 71 this year, added that he had developed antibodies to protect against the coronavirus. In a short interview after his speech, Mr. Chen said that he had received the Sinopharm vaccine, one of several now in Phase 3 trials in China. A third of the Commerce Ministry’s staff has joined him in applying for the trial and receiving the vaccine, he added.
0~The New York Times~THE CORRECTIONS By Jonathan Franzen. 568 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26. Jonathan Franzen's marvelous new novel, ''The Corrections,'' starts out as discouragingly as any marvelous new novel you'll ever read. The very first page devotes a full paragraph to overextending the metaphor of an ''alarm bell of anxiety'' ringing in a suburban house, in a community heavy-handedly called St. Jude. Then, when a septuagenarian Parkinson's sufferer named Alfred Lambert goes into demented exile in that house's basement, Franzen set off my alarm bell of anxiety by warning that some larger significance might be about to hit me over the head: ''And so in the house of the Lamberts, as in St. Jude, as in the country as a whole, life came to be lived underground.'' Next we meet Chip Lambert, the black-sheep son -- hey, I didn't name these people Lambert -- who had to leave his teaching job because he (yawn) had an affair with a student and is now writing a screenplay, based on the (yawn) Lewinsky scandal, and beginning it with a parodically preposterous monologue on ''anxieties of the phallus in Tudor drama.'' Even though Franzen spares us the monologue itself, I was all set to bail on him, despite the microfelicities (ants ''storming'' a dead opossum; ''assassin-like chauffeurs'' holding up signs at La Guardia) that showed he could actually write. Did I need several hundred more pages of standard-issue smarty-pants high jinks? Or, worse yet, of suburban angst speaking, in large caps, boldface and italics, to our condition? Cripes, why not just call the book ''American Something-or-other''? You know, truth in packaging. You could read ''The Corrections'' as a conventional realist saga of multigenerational family dynamics -- that's how the publisher spins it -- and love's mutating mysteries, with just enough novel-of-paranoia touches so Oprah won't assign it and ruin Franzen's street cred. Or you could read it as a trickier and trendier sort of work, which flawlessly mimics old-school plottiness, readability and character development in order to seduce you into realms of bottomless geopolitical-spiritual disquiet. Damned if I know. But I know what made me decide to stick with the thing long enough to tell I liked it. It was Chip's cockamamie justification for the obviously suicidal beginning of his own magnum opus: '' 'My idea,' Chip said, 'was to have this ''hump'' that the moviegoer has to get over. Putting something off-putting at the beginning, it's a classic modernist strategy. There's a lot of rich suspense toward the end.' '' Aha. Was this Franzen's own way of hinting that he himself had a bunch of goodies up his sleeve that he meant to hold back awhile longer out of sheer modernist cussedness? And that I'd miss out if I didn't pull up my socks and soldier on? Well, sure enough, just a few pages later the book started getting better. First Chip's apparently sane sister, Denise, arrives and immediately makes herself the reader's ally. ''If I grant that these are interesting issues,'' she asks Chip, who is delivering a too-familiar aria about antidepressants as an adjunct to consumerism, ''will you stop talking about them?'' Next comes a flashback in which one of Chip's students (she's splendidly hostile and relentlessly seductive) lays siege to his virtue and gives him a mysterious drug, an antidepressant-aphrodisiac in golden caplets she calls ''Mexican A'' -- and which we somehow sense (and if we don't, I'm telling you) that we'll learn much, much more about. And suddenly we were rocking: I only put the book down again when my life needed tending to. Mind you, I'm still not convinced that Franzen actually meant his first 30 pages to be such a slog, but it's an awfully funny coincidence. It shouldn't interfere with anybody's rich suspense to report that all the mighty bulk of ''The Corrections'' turns on a single, definingly American question: Will Mom be able to get the whole family home for one last Christmas? Franzen tucks the more momentous questions into a branching system of subplots, starring each of the main characters in turn and making each one equally sympathetic. Will Alfred (a) be put in a nursing home, (b) enter a radical new treatment plan that proposes to restructure his brain or (c) deliver himself with that Hemingway-evoking shotgun in the basement? Will Denise, who cooks at a nouveller-than-thou restaurant, end up in bed with (a) her financial backer, (b) his wife or (c) both? Will Chip get (a) rich off that screenplay, (b) his married girlfriend back or (c) himself killed during a coup in Lithuania, where he goes as an aide to a politician turned con man? Will Gary, the banker who's the oldest of the Lamberts' offspring, (a) make a killing in biotech stocks, (b) stand up to his crafty wife and mocking children or (c) just keep drinking? Finally, will Enid, the materfamilias, ever get a grip?
0~Trump Administration Imposes Sanctions on Iran’s Top Diplomat~And even as administration officials imposed sanctions on Mr. Zarif, they extended waivers on separate sanctions, related to Iran’s nuclear program, which were scheduled to kick in on Thursday. Those penalties would have dealt a new blow to the 2015 nuclear deal. Appearing Wednesday on Fox Business Network, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said that the waivers would be extended for 90 days. Iran hawks in Congress strongly opposed the extension. It is unclear whether Mr. Zarif holds any assets in the United States that would be frozen under Wednesday’s action, or how easily the administration could bar him from entering the country. As foreign minister, Mr. Zarif regularly visits Iran’s Mission to the United Nations in New York to skillfully present Tehran’s case. In his most recent visit, he contended that the United States was honor bound to respect the deal it reached four years ago — especially because no international bodies found that Iran was out of compliance. Such arguments, delivered in the colloquial English that Mr. Zarif learned in prep school, college and graduate school in the United States, make him an often witty interlocutor with deep knowledge of the American political scene. That has also made him suspect in Tehran, where his many opponents call him “Zarif the American”; he sold out Tehran in the 2015 agreement, they contend, and was duped by his counterpart, the secretary of state at the time, John Kerry. A senior Trump administration official suggested that Mr. Zarif had been afforded too much credibility over the years, saying that “the United States has decided enough is enough.” Trump administration officials maintained that talking to Mr. Zarif was pointless because, they insisted, he lacked true decision-making authority. But he clearly had enough influence in 2015 to sell the Iran deal to the supreme leader. Even so, Mr. Pompeo insisted he was determined to follow a diplomatic route, saying that the United States continued to seek a “solution that addresses the Iranian regime’s destructive behavior.” “The only path forward is a comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of its threats,” he said. “Until then, our campaign of diplomatic isolation and maximum economic pressure will continue.”
0~A Stranded $2 Trillion Overseas Stash Gets Closer to Coming Home~The next president may have a rare opportunity to close tax loopholes that have let American corporations stash more than $2 trillion in untaxed profits outside the United States. This enormous hoard of stranded cash has barely been an issue in the contentious election campaign of 2016, and precise predictions of deals that could be made in Washington are foolhardy until the nation goes to the polls. But this much is clear: There is a growing political consensus that the time has come for change in the tax rules to encourage repatriation of the vast troves of corporate earnings held outside the country. Companies, ordinary American taxpayers and thousands of investors have substantial and sometimes conflicting stakes in the outcome. “Everyone agrees that something is going to be done about this,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now a law professor at the University of Southern California. “The question, of course, is exactly what.”

0~How Options Trading Could Be Fueling a Stock Market Bubble~The combination of the sudden growth in options trading and the unbridled optimism of the buyers is a market-moving force in itself. How options can drive the market. An individual who wants to make a bet that a stock price is going to rise can buy a call option at a brokerage firm. This contract gives the buyer the right — but not the obligation — to buy a stock at a given price at some point in the future. If the share price is higher on that date, the buyer can purchase the shares using the contract, then sell them for a profit. But just as the buyer stands to benefit from a rising share price, the dealer who sold the contract stands to lose. Brokerage firms make money by charging fees on products, not by predicting where share prices go. So to hedge their risk on a given contract, they buy a calculated percentage of the stock they would be forced to sell if the buyer ended up making money on the bet. But as the stock prices rise, brokers must buy more shares to keep their hedges in balance. And buying more shares helps push share prices up. In other words, rising share prices boost demand for shares even further, all because of market dynamics — not because of a fundamental view that the company’s business prospects are improving.
0~Netanyahu Gets First Crack at Forming a New Government in Israel~JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was asked by the president on Tuesday to try to form a new coalition government, offering a possible path for him to remain in office even as he stands trial on corruption charges. It won’t be easy, and success is by no means guaranteed given the abiding divisions that have led to a political impasse, which has only worsened year by year. While the country remains split along the fault lines of secular and religious, right-wing and left-wing and Jewish and Arab, the main rupture has increasingly revolved around the polarizing figure of Mr. Netanyahu himself. He got the nod to form a new government one day after the opening of the evidentiary stage of his trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. A political survivor and Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu has spent the last 12 years in office. But after four inconclusive elections in two years, he and his allies have failed to win enough support to ensure a parliamentary majority that could decisively end the country’s political deadlock.
0~The Ukrainian Prosecutor Behind the Dossier Targeting Hunter Biden~KIEV, Ukraine — When the Ukrainian prosecutor Kostiantyn H. Kulyk compiled a seven-page dossier in English that accused the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of corruption, he helped set off a political firestorm that has led to the impeachment investigation of President Trump. But even as he was reopening a corruption case related to Hunter Biden’s service on the board of Burisma Holdings, a major Ukrainian gas company, Mr. Kulyk himself was under a cloud of suspicion. He has been indicted three times on corruption charges and accused of bringing politically motivated criminal cases against his opponents. In a Ukrainian security clearance form, Mr. Kulyk admitted having ties to a warlord in eastern Ukraine accused of working for the Russian intelligence services. Yet none of this — including the case related to the Bidens — has seemed to harm the career of Mr. Kulyk, who remains a department head in the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office under a new president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
0~Can Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Nominee, Swing the Election?~In Gary Johnson’s first run for the presidency in 2012, as the Libertarian Party candidate, he won just under 1 percent of the popular vote. He did not surpass 3 percent in any state. That’s not exactly a strong showing. But 2016 could prove more favorable because of the unpopularity of both major party candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Mr. Johnson is at roughly 10 percent in recent polls, well above where he was in 2012. The question, of course, is whether it will have any impact. Is This a Lot? American presidential elections are not set up to favor third parties. The first-past-the-post voting methods, in which the winner of the state gets all its electoral votes, make it hard for third parties to get a foothold. (In political science, this is a concept known as Duverger’s Law.)
0~‘Geniuses’ Versus the Guns: A Campus Crackdown Shocks Iran~After the sit-in the students streamed into the main yard of the university and realized they were under siege. Campus guards were clashing with the security forces to prevent them from entering the school and locked the gates. When four students tried to leave, the Basiji grabbed them, pounding them with batons. One student was taken to the hospital for treatment for a head injury. A group of about 70 faculty members were meeting in a nearby building to discuss the protests and a strategy for freeing detained students when they heard a commotion outside and rounds of gunfire. Their phones began to beep with appeals from students seeking help. The professors ran outside and encountered a scene of chaos that one of them described as a war zone: blood on the ground, tear gas in the air, bullets flying, shrieking cries for help. The professors encircled the students, locking arms to form a human shield around them. One of the professors shouted to the Basiji that they would have to kill them first if they wanted to shoot or arrest the students. The Basiji fired shots in the air and one told a professor to shut up or he would be shot dead. When some professors approached the Basiji to try to negotiate a secure exit for students, they beat them violently. One professor was thrown to the ground and kicked repeatedly. Another who tried unsuccessfully to take some female students away in his car was seized by the Basij and choked with a baton. He was told, according to the internal communications seen by The New York Times, that “we could kill you, and no one would know.” Hundreds of students fled into an underground parking garage that exited onto a busy street and into a nearby subway station. But they didn’t realize that dozens of Basiji had forced their way into the garage and locked the gates. The events that followed were captured by students in a video posted on social media, and corroborated with witness accounts. Young men and women, wearing backpacks and trying to flee, screamed as the Basij opened fire on them with rubber and paintball bullets. The floor of the parking garage was covered with blood. Basij rooted out students hiding behind cars and pounded their bodies and heads with kicks and punches. About 50 students were arrested and some were shoved into vans and taken away with sacks placed on their heads and handcuffs around their wrists. If anyone intervened they would beat them too.
0~Toronto Van Driver Kills at Least 10 People in ‘Pure Carnage’~TORONTO — The killing began on a busy lunchtime thoroughfare in Toronto on Monday when a white rental Ryder van ran over a pedestrian crossing the street — then mounted a sidewalk and began plowing into people indiscriminately. “One by one, one by one,” said a witness who identified himself as Ali. “Holy God, I’ve never seen such a sight before. I feel sick.” By the end, at least 10 people were dead and 15 were injured, said the authorities. The driver’s actions, they said, appeared intentional, but did not seem to have been an act of terrorism. “The city is safe,” said the Toronto police chief, Mark Saunders.
0~Hollywood Unions Agree to Relax Pandemic Protocols on Movie Sets~Hollywood’s major unions agreed Monday night to a short-term plan that would allow studios to require everyone on a production set to be vaccinated. The agreement, which will be in effect through the end of September, will also relax some pandemic protocols on production sets, even as the Delta variant climbs and Los Angeles County puts a mask mandate for indoor settings back in place. Studios will be able to decrease the rate of regular coronavirus testing and loosen mask mandates in outdoor settings. The arrangement was agreed on by the Directors Guild of America, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, along with the studios as represented by the Alliance of Motion Pictures and Television Producers. The parties said they would continue monitoring Covid-19 developments and “will consider further modifications.”
0~Yahoo’s Top Lawyer Resigns and C.E.O. Marissa Mayer Loses Bonus in Wake of Hack~SAN FRANCISCO — Yahoo’s top lawyer, Ronald S. Bell, resigned Wednesday, and its chief executive, Marissa Mayer, lost her 2016 bonus after a board investigation of the 2014 theft of information on more than 500 million user accounts. Senior executives, company lawyers and information security staff were aware of the hack in 2014 and also knew about subsequent attempts to break into the affected accounts in 2015 and 2016, but failed to “properly comprehend or investigate” the situation, the company’s board of directors said in a securities filing on Wednesday. The board “did not conclude that there was an intentional suppression of relevant information.” Those hackers, which Yahoo believes were connected to a foreign government, used the stolen information to forge a type of software called a cookie that could be used to access 32 million Yahoo accounts, the company said. Ms. Mayer, who will also give up her 2017 equity compensation in connection with the incident, said in a statement that she did not learn of the breach until September 2016, when Yahoo first disclosed the hack to the public. “However, I am the C.E.O. of the company and since this incident happened during my tenure, I have agreed to forgo my annual bonus and my annual equity grant this year,” she wrote.
0~Google and Samsung Sign Broad Cross-Licensing Agreement~TOKYO — Google and Samsung Electronics have signed a broad agreement to cross-license a range of each other’s patents, bolstering ties between the two main powers behind the global pre-eminence of the Android operating system for smartphones. The deal, announced late Sunday, comes amid a proliferation of patent litigation among technology companies and so-called patent trolls, who buy up patents to enforce intellectual property rights — through the courts, if needed. “By working together on agreements like this, companies can reduce the potential for litigation and focus instead on innovation,” Allen Lo, deputy general counsel for patents at Google, said in a news release. Google and Samsung said the agreement covered existing patents as well as some that would be filed during the next 10 years. Although a “broad range of technologies and business areas” are covered, the deal does not cover every patent that each company holds.
0~A Rare Kind of Filly Dazzles at the Racetrack~Sodashi won the Victoria Mile on Sunday with a closing rally and received an especially loud roar from the fans at Tokyo Racecourse. The cheers did not come exclusively from those who had bet her to win at 5-1. The filly has become a sensation in Japanese horse racing circles because of her color: pure white. White thoroughbred horses are exceedingly rare: As few as one in 100,000 are considered pure white. To qualify, the horse’s entire coat must be white and cannot have any other colors. Sodashi meets that definition. Other light-colored horses that you might see at the track are registered as gray (a mixture of black and white hairs) or roan (red or brown and white). Some of these may become whiter as they grow older but still don’t qualify as the rare white horse. Plenty of gray and roan horses have fared well over the years, including Kentucky Derby winners like Spectacular Bid in 1979, Winning Colors in 1988 and Silver Charm in 1997. But the handful of white horses hadn’t really distinguished themselves until Sodashi came along.
0~Trump’s Tough Talk on Nafta Raises Prospects of Pact’s Demise~WASHINGTON — The North American Free Trade Agreement, long disparaged by President Trump as bad for the United States, was edging closer toward collapse as negotiators gathered for a fourth round of contentious talks here this week. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has sparred with American businesses that support Nafta and has pushed for significant changes that negotiators from Mexico and Canada say are nonstarters. All the while, the president has continued threatening to withdraw the United States from the trade agreement, which he has maligned as the worst in history. As the trade talks began on Wednesday, Mr. Trump, seated in the Oval Office beside Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, said it was “possible” that the United States would drop out of Nafta. “It’s possible we won’t be able to make a deal, and it’s possible that we will,” the president said. “We’ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers. And in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also. So we’ll see what happens with Nafta, but I’ve been opposed to Nafta for a long time, in terms of the fairness of Nafta.”
0~Taliban Enter Key Cities in Afghanistan’s North After Swift Offensive~KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban entered two provincial capitals in northern Afghanistan Sunday, local officials said, the culmination of an insurgent offensive that has overrun dozens of rural districts and forced the surrender and capture of hundreds of government forces and their military equipment in recent weeks. In Kunduz city, the capital of the province of the same name, the Taliban seized the city’s entrance before dispersing throughout its neighborhoods. Kunduz was briefly taken by the Taliban in 2015 and 2016 before they were pushed back by American airstrikes, special operations forces and Afghan security forces. “Right now, I hear the sound of bullets,” said Amruddin Wali, a member of Kunduz’s provincial council. “The Taliban have appeared in the alleys and back alleys of Kunduz, and there is panic all over the city.” The setbacks come at a harrowing moment for Afghanistan. American and international troops, now mostly based in Kabul, the capital, and at Bagram airfield, are set to leave the country in weeks.
0~Doris Day: A Hip Sex Goddess Disguised as the Girl Next Door~The Hollywood Reporter obituary for Doris Day describes her in the headline as “Hollywood’s Favorite Girl Next Door,” which is reasonable enough, if not terribly imaginative. Day, who was 97 when she died on Monday, broke through as a singer in the mid-1940s and crossed over into movie stardom in the next decade. She’s still often remembered as an avatar of the postwar, pre-counterculture pop culture mainstream: wholesome, friendly, sexless. Accordingly, the first adjective applied to her in that article’s summary is “virginal.” That word evokes a leering one-liner attributed to the musician and wit Oscar Levant, who said he “knew Doris Day before she was a virgin.” Levant’s joke depends on a category mistake, confusing the persona of a star with her person (Day was married four times), even as it misses the joke tucked into the persona itself. The v-word applied to Day signals the acceptance of an alibi that was never meant to be believed in the first place, the literal-minded gloss on a text that was only there to beckon us toward the subtext. The truth, hidden in plain sight in so many of her movies and musical performances, is that Doris Day was a sex goddess. That’s not a term we use much anymore (for good reason), and in its heyday it was generally applied to actresses who wielded their erotic energies more nakedly, so to speak. [Read our obituary of Doris Day. | Stream four great Day movies (and one TV show).] Day wasn’t a glamorous blond enigma like Grace Kelly or Kim Novak — though she did, like both of them, work with Alfred Hitchcock. She was not a Hollywood bombshell in the manner of Marilyn Monroe (or Mamie Van Doren, with whom she competed for Clark Gable’s attention in the 1958 comedy “Teacher’s Pet”). And she certainly didn’t work in the same erogenous zone as European actresses like Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren, who promised sophisticated American moviegoers a glimpse of freedom from Puritanical inhibition, and sometimes also from clothes.
0~Queen Elizabeth will skip Friday’s church service after ‘discomfort’ during the jubilee’s first day.~Queen Elizabeth II has decided to skip a thanksgiving service on Friday, one of the major events of her Platinum Jubilee, after experiencing discomfort on a busy first day of festivities. The palace said late on Thursday that the queen “greatly enjoyed” the military parade that marked her birthday, but “did experience some discomfort.” “Taking into account the journey and activity required to participate in tomorrow’s National Service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul’s Cathedral, Her Majesty with great reluctance has concluded she will not attend,” the palace said in a statement. The queen, who appeared on the balcony at Buckingham Palace twice on Thursday, experienced some mobility issues during the festivities, according to a palace official. She has complained of trouble walking in the past, and has canceled several other public engagements, including the state opening of Parliament last month.
0~‘Testilying’ by Police: A Stubborn Problem~In many instances, the motive for lying was readily apparent: to skirt constitutional restrictions against unreasonable searches and stops. In other cases, the falsehoods appear aimed at convicting people — who may or may not have committed a crime — with trumped-up evidence. In still others, the motive is not easy to discern. In October 2016, for example, a plainclothes Brooklyn officer gave a grand jury a first-person account of a gun arrest. Putting herself in the center of the action, the officer, Dornezia Agard, testified that as she approached a man to confront him for littering, he suddenly crouched behind a van, pulled from his waistband a dark object — later identified as a gun — and threw it on the ground. “P.O. Agard testified that she heard a hard metal object hit the ground,” according to a letter the Brooklyn district attorney’s office wrote summarizing her testimony. But prosecutors lost faith in her account in July 2017, after learning from other officers that she was not among the first officers on the scene. Officer Agard had arrived later as backup, according to the letter, which noted that the gun charges against the man were later dismissed. The prosecutors did not address why Officer Agard claimed to be a witness, or why the other officers present seem to have allowed her to process the arrest. Police lying raises the likelihood that the innocent end up in jail — and that as juries and judges come to regard the police as less credible, or as cases are dismissed when the lies are discovered, the guilty will go free. Police falsehoods also impede judges’ efforts to enforce constitutional limits on police searches and seizures. “We have 36,000 officers with law enforcement power, and there are a small handful of these cases every year,” said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the Police Department, the nation’s largest municipal force. “That doesn’t make any of these cases any less troubling. Our goal is always, always zero. One is too many, but we have taken significant steps to combat this issue.” Shrouded, but Persistent The 25 cases identified by The Times are almost certainly only a fraction of those in which officers have come under suspicion for lying in the past three years. That’s because a vast majority of cases end in plea deals before an officer is ever required to take the witness stand in open court, meaning the possibility that an officer lied is seldom aired in public. And in the rare cases when an officer does testify in court — and a judge finds the testimony suspicious, leading to the dismissal of the case — the proceedings are often sealed afterward.
0~A Sour Surprise for Public Pensions: Two Sets of Books~When one of the tiniest pension funds imaginable — for Citrus Pest Control District No. 2, serving just six people in California — decided last year to convert itself to a 401(k) plan, it seemed like a no-brainer. After all, the little fund held far more money than it needed, according to its official numbers from California’s renowned public pension system, Calpers. Except it really didn’t. In fact, it was significantly underfunded. Suddenly Calpers began demanding a payment of more than half a million dollars. “My board was somewhat shocked,” said Larry Houser, the general manager of the pest control district, whose workers tame the bugs and blights that threaten their corner of California citrus country. It is just a few miles down the road from Joshua Tree National Park.

0~Doctor Confirms Kim Jong-il Stroke~PARIS  The North Korean leader Kim Jong-il had a stroke in August but appears to be better, according to a French doctor who has treated him. The doctor, François-Xavier Roux, told Le Figaro, the French daily: “Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.” Dr. Roux, a Paris-based neurosurgeon, added: “The photos that have just been published seem recent and authentic to me. I have the impression that he is in charge in North Korea. I can’t say more because of medical confidentiality and state secrecy.” United States and South Korean officials have said that Mr. Kim, 66, suffered a stroke in August, raising questions about a possible succession and about who was making decisions on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
0~New York Rewrites Harassment Laws, but Some Say the Changes Fall Short~ALBANY — New York will ban most nondisclosure agreements and mandatory arbitration in sexual harassment complaints, and will require government employees found responsible for committing harassment to refund any taxpayer-financed payouts, according to a revision of state laws adopted by the Legislature on Friday. Senator Catharine Young, a Republican from western New York who helped write the Senate’s original draft of the bill, called the measures “a major victory.” “We’re going to protect everyone across the board, so I’m very very enthused about the fact that we have gotten it done,” she told reporters on Friday. But the failure of the bills to actually define sexual harassment led some women’s rights advocates and employment lawyers to warn that the policies could be narrowly interpreted. They said the language should have incorporated a more expansive understanding of gender-based discrimination, as well.
0~Investigations Into 2020 Candidates Must Be Cleared by Top Justice Dept. Officials~The attorney general has long expressed skepticism about the F.B.I.’s decision to investigate the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia in 2016, and he has tapped a top prosecutor to begin a criminal investigation into the origins of that inquiry. He has also criticized the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey for publicly discussing the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server without approval from Justice Department officials. “In certain cases, the existence of a federal criminal or counterintelligence investigation, if it becomes known to the public, may have unintended effects on our elections,” Mr. Barr wrote. Those concerns, combined with the inspector general’s findings, seemed to underpin Mr. Barr’s memo to top Justice Department officials. While the department must respond “swiftly and decisively” to credible threats to the electoral process, “we also must be sensitive to safeguarding the department’s reputation for fairness, neutrality and nonpartisanship,” he wrote. He previewed the new policy at a news conference in January, when he said his approval would be required in future investigations involving presidential candidates or campaigns.

0~‘Frustration and Stress’: State Officials Fault Rollout of Monkeypox Vaccine~Instead, the stockpile was designed to deliver massive amounts of vaccine to each state in response to a catastrophic event, according to a federal official with knowledge of the stockpile’s operations. “If it was a smallpox response, they’re not going to be sitting in their offices ordering vaccine,” the official said of state health authorities. The stockpile is intended to be “pushing products out — it’s not an ordering-based system,” the official added. As it stands now, the stockpile is shipping monkeypox vaccine to just five sites in each state, regardless of its size. State officials must distribute the doses, track them manually and enter the data into their databases, none of which would have been necessary under the C.D.C.’s system. Until recently, orders for Jynneos had to be placed via email instead of an automated system, and state officials often did not know where their deliveries were or whether they had been sent at all. Some containers arrived without labels saying they contained vaccines or needed cold storage. Some were tracked down only after multiple emails and phone calls. Doses of Jynneos have arrived in the dead of night. “We had no way to track vaccine shipments, when they actually shipped or when they were going to arrive,” Chris Van Deusen, director of media relations at the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in an email. “They just showed up with no notice.” H.H.S. officials two weeks ago switched to a different ordering system, which has been used to deliver antiviral drugs from the stockpile. But that system is also not linked to state immunization databases, and it is not well suited to monitoring the special conditions needed for transporting vaccines, several state officials said in interviews.

0~Taliban Widen Afghan Attacks From Base in Pakistan~WASHINGTON  Senior Taliban leaders, showing a surprising level of sophistication and organization, are using their sanctuary in Pakistan to stoke a widening campaign of violence in northern and western Afghanistan, senior American military and intelligence officials say. The Taliban’s expansion into parts of Afghanistan that it once had little influence over comes as the Obama administration is struggling to settle on a new military strategy for Afghanistan, and as the White House renews its efforts to get Pakistan’s government to be more aggressive about killing or capturing Taliban leaders inside Pakistan. American military and intelligence officials, who insisted on anonymity because they were discussing classified information, said the Taliban’s leadership council, led by Mullah Muhammad Omar and operating around the southern Pakistani city of Quetta, was directly responsible for a wave of violence in once relatively placid parts of northern and western Afghanistan. A recent string of attacks killed troops from Italy and Germany, pivotal American allies that are facing strong opposition to the Afghan war at home. These assessments echo a recent report by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top military commander in Afghanistan, in portraying the Taliban as an increasingly sophisticated shadow government that sees itself on the cusp of victory in the war-ravaged nation.

Nevertheless, the use of the system has come under scrutiny after the unclassified version of the whistle-blower complaint was made public. The complaint raised questions that the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president had been improperly placed in the classified system, suggesting that officials put the reconstructed transcript into a system meant to protect the nation’s most sensitive secrets. The Trump administration said on Friday that National Security Council lawyers had made the decision to place the reconstructed transcript of that phone call into a highly classified computer system accessible to only a small number of officials. “N.S.C. lawyers directed that the classified document be handled appropriately,” said a senior administration official. The statement was also first reported by CNN. But the official did not actually say how the document was handled, nor address the whistle-blower’s specific charge that the reconstructed transcript, in what would be a highly unusual action, was moved from a computer system widely accessible to National Security Council officials to one reserved for those with code-word clearance to handle the country’s most closely guarded secrets like covert operations and foreign surveillance. A White House spokesman did not respond when asked about that specific claim. Democrats in Congress and former N.S.C. officials and lawyers in both parties have said such an action, if motivated by a desire to conceal Mr. Trump’s efforts to put political pressure on the Ukrainian leader, would be far from appropriate, and at a minimum, unethical. But in a combative exchange with reporters later in the day, Kellyanne Conway, a White House counselor, repeated the spokesman’s language, saying that “as I understand, the document was handled appropriately at all times.” “I think the most important thing about said document is that the whole world has access to it now,” Ms. Conway said, citing its release by the White House this week.
0~The Urgent Search for a Cyber Silver Bullet Against Iran~WASHINGTON — After spending billions of dollars to assemble the world’s most potent arsenal of cyberweapons and plant them in networks around the world, United States Cyber Command — and the new era of warfighting it has come to represent — may face a critical test in the coming weeks. President Trump is considering a range of options to punish Iran for this month’s attack on Saudi oil facilities, and has toughened sanctions on Iran and ordered the deployment of additional troops to the region. But a second cyberstrike — after one launched against Iran just three months ago — has emerged as the most appealing course of action for Mr. Trump, who is reluctant to widen the conflict in a region he has said the United States should leave, according to senior American officials. But even as the Pentagon considers specific targets — an attempt to shut down Iran’s oil fields and refineries has been one of the “proportionate responses” under review — a broader debate is taking place inside and outside the administration over whether a cyberattack alone will be enough to alter Iran’s calculations, and what kind of retaliation a particularly damaging cyberstrike might provoke. “The president talked about our use of those previously, but I’m certainly not going to forecast what we’ll do as we move forward,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” when asked whether a cyber attack might be an artful, non-escalatory response to this month’s drone or missile strikes on two of Saudi Arabia’s most important facilities. “This was Iran true and true, and the United States will respond in a way that reflects that act of war by this Iranian revolutionary regime.”
0~‘Shocking and Abhorrent’ Abuse Rampant in U.K. Parliament, Report Says~LONDON — A scathing new report on Britain’s House of Commons released on Monday describes a culture of bullying, abuse and sexual harassment “as embedded as it is shocking,” where complaints of mistreatment are typically muffled by “deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence.” The inquiry, led by a former high court judge, Dame Laura Cox, was commissioned in March, after a BBC report found that harassment complaints were often batted away by employees trained to protect the interests of senior staff members. Among the legislators named in the March BBC report was Speaker John Bercow, the chair of the House of Commons commission, which oversees the administration of the House. Mr. Bercow, a flamboyant, foghorn-voiced Conservative who has occupied the post since 2009, has denied the allegations. Though Ms. Cox did not specifically address Mr. Bercow in her report, she wrote that “the core, cultural context” must be changed, and that doing so would most likely require a generational turnover.
0~RED IN TOOTH AND CLAW~INSIDE THE AQUARIUM The Making of a Top Soviet Spy. By Viktor Suvorov. 249 pp. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company. $17.95. VIKTOR SUVOROV is the pseudonym of a gifted Russian who served as an officer in Soviet military intelligence, known as the G.R.U. Several years ago he escaped to Great Britain, learned to write in English and became a successful author. In this, his fourth and best book, he illuminates life within the secret order to which he belonged. At the outset, the author is watching a training film for inductees into the G.R.U., a silent, grainy film that shows him the inside of the G.R.U. crematorium. Attendants clad in protective gray gowns gently glide a coffin between furnace fire doors into an inferno. Next the camera focuses on the handsome, sweating face of an elegantly attired man lashed by steel wires to a stretcher. He is very much alive, and Mr. Suvorov realizes the man is about to be burned alive. ''He strains to the point of breaking his own bones, and tearing his own tendons and muscles. It is a superhuman effort. But the wire does not give. And the stretcher slides smoothly along the rails. The furnace doors move aside again and the fire casts a white light on the soles of the man's dirty patent leather shoes. He tries to bend his knees in an effort to increase the distance between his feet and the roaring fire. But he can't.'' I am not sure that the G.R.U. actually incinerates heretical officers, which is what the film was intended to demonstrate. Neither am I sure that many other stark scenes actually occurred precisely as the author relates. But better than any other, this book bares the spirit and mentality of a formidable clandestine force at work in much of the world.
0~Remains Examined for Link to Missing Boy With Autism~Nearly every morning for the past 104 mornings, Avonte Oquendo’s mother, Vanessa Fontaine, has woken up to the same nightmare. But each day, she wiped away tears and pressed on in the search for her missing son, a boy with severe autism who was last seen in early October. Surveillance video showed the 14-year-old darting out of his school in Long Island City, Queens, in the middle of the day. But on Friday, at 2 a.m., she was stirred awake by a phone call that she had been dreading. Human remains had washed ashore in Queens, and the New York Police Department needed her to provide DNA. They had reason to believe the remains belonged to Avonte. The city’s medical examiner was still working on Friday to make a positive identification, but it seemed increasingly likely that Avonte would not be coming home. Along with the remains, the police found a pair of size 5 1/2 Air Jordan sneakers that matched the description of those Avonte was wearing when he went missing, David H. Perecman, a lawyer for the family, said.
0~How Online Hobbyists Can Reaffirm Your Faith in the Internet~I speak of the hobbyist internet. These days, any pastime worth pursuing — pottery, cooking, gardening, quilting, woodworking and beyond — attracts a constellation of blogs, message boards, Facebook groups, Amazon reviewers, Instagram and Etsy influencers, and many hundreds of YouTube stars. Collectively, they form the online social structure around any hobby, a group of folks who are only too happy to help you learn whatever you are trying to master. It is here, in the hobbyist internet’s daily collective struggle to make the best hamburger or grow the perfect tomato, that you can glimpse a healthier relationship with your digital devices. And not a moment too soon. The internet has gotten a bad rap lately, and we are justifiably worried that our digital devices are driving isolation and fear, polarization and addiction, loneliness and outrage. The worries seem to call for a simple fix — we should all just use the internet less often. But on the hobbyist internet, the opposite applies. Consider how one gets started with pottery. To make a pot on a potter’s wheel, you must first manipulate your ball of clay so that its center of mass matches the rotational center of the spinning wheel. This goal — “centering,” in the jargon — sounds simple, but figuring out how to do it is a subtle process of trial and error, and there is really only one way to get it right: to try again and again until it clicks. Three months ago, I was stuck in centering hell. I would spend most of my time at the wheel trying to center, but with only two hours a week in class, I was not making much progress. Then I discovered a way to supercharge my training: YouTube, where thousands of ceramists from around the world post videos of themselves making pots.
0~Hopes Dim for DACA Deal as Lawmakers Battle Over Trump’s Immigration Remarks~WASHINGTON — After three days of denunciations from around the world, President Trump declared that he is “not a racist” on Sunday, even as the uproar over his vulgar remarks on immigration overshadowed critical issues facing the capital, including efforts to protect young undocumented immigrants and avert a government shutdown. Mr. Trump also insisted that he had not made the inflammatory comments in a White House meeting on Thursday, part of a newly aggressive defense and a counterattack on Democrats by the president and his allies. But his remarks on Sunday were a departure from the White House’s initial statement last week, which did not deny the comments. “I’m not a racist,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday night as he arrived at Trump International Golf Club in Florida for dinner with Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, who attended the meeting last week and has not spoken publicly about it. “I am the least racist person you have ever interviewed, that I can tell you.” His comments, while extraordinary coming from a president of the United States, echoed reassurances Mr. Trump has made several times before.
0~Photo Archive Is Said to Show Widespread Torture in Syria~Mr. Assad’s enemies say they hope the leak, first reported in The Guardian and on CNN, will cause enough revulsion in the West to prevent any deal that might leave him in place, or perhaps prod the West into more muscular steps to remove him, just as the disclosure of the Serbian massacre at Srebrenica in 1995 moved NATO to launch airstrikes in the Balkans. But even the most determined advocates of Western intervention say the images may dramatize the moral cost of inaction but are unlikely to change the policy, especially given the American aversion to another entanglement in the Middle East. “I feel like we have had at least one or two Srebrenica moments in Syria already,” said Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has pushed for American action. “The White House has completely hardened itself to whatever horrendous news might come out of Syria because the president doesn’t want to get involved.” The photos were made public by an anonymous military policeman who had a grim role in the bureaucracy of the Syrian security apparatus, according to the lawyers’ report assessing the photos’ veracity. The photos were used to provide death certificates to the families of the victims without turning over the bodies, and were archived as a record that the men had been killed. After “psychological suffering” caused by his job, Caesar saved the photos on a portable disk drive, and he and the disk were smuggled out of the country by antigovernment activists, the report said. The activists contacted the Qatari government, Qatar hired a London law firm, and it commissioned a team of legal and forensics experts to assess the credibility of Caesar and his photos.

0~Woman Shot in Capitol Has Died~A woman who was fatally shot inside the Capitol after it was overrun by a pro-Trump mob was struck by gunfire from a Capitol Police officer, a police official said Wednesday night. Chief Robert J. Contee of the Metropolitan Police Department told reporters that the woman had been shot by a police officer on Wednesday afternoon as plainclothes police officers confronted the mob. She later died in a hospital, he said, and the shooting is being investigated. At least 14 Capitol Police officers were injured during the demonstrations on Wednesday, Chief Contee said, including two who were hospitalized. A video posted to Twitter earlier on Wednesday appeared to show a shooting in the Capitol. The woman in the video appeared to climb onto a small ledge next to a doorway inside the building immediately before a single loud bang is heard. The woman, draped in a flag, fell to the ground at the top of a stairwell. A man with a helmet and a military-style rifle stood next to her after she fell, and shouts of “police” could be heard as a man in a suit approached the woman and crouched next to her.
0~Shots Fired Along India-China Border for First Time in Years~NEW DELHI — Tensions along the India-China border took an alarming turn on Tuesday after Chinese and Indian officials accused each other’s soldiers of firing warning shots, apparently the first time in decades that guns had been aggressively used along the disputed frontier. Military activities along the unofficial border, which zigs and zags through some of the highest mountain ranges on Earth, are difficult to verify. But according to a statement from the Chinese military, Indian troops on Monday “took the outrageous step of firing warning shots” near a Chinese border patrol. India’s actions, the Chinese said, were “a grave military provocation of a vile character.” Indian officials, however, denied their soldiers had fired any shots and said it was the Chinese who broke the long tradition of refraining from using firearms, a protocol in place for decades.
0~At the Opera, Humans Bear Witness to Atrocity, or Ignore It~AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France — The bodies kept coming up. First one. Then another. Then a dozen. Then a hundred. After an hour of “Resurrection,” the opening night production at the Aix-en-Provence Festival, 160 decomposing corpses lay in neat, sickening rows on a stage covered in dark earth. The exhumation of a shallow mass grave is a grimly familiar sight: Sudan, Srebrenica, Veracruz, Rwanda, so many others. In March, Bucha, Ukraine, added to that litany a scene so eerily reminiscent of the one being staged here that the festival sent out an email assuring audiences that the director, Romeo Castellucci, had conceived the production a year before the war broke out. Three years ago at the Aix Festival, Castellucci presented “Requiem,” a staging of Mozart’s final work. In a series of enigmatic episodes, he set to the mournful, churning music an evocation of civilization’s full span, from birth — with plangent child singers — to vibrant, folk-dancing life, and shadowy implosion amid battles and nature’s destruction. His new piece, which premiered on Monday, is a pendant to “Requiem,” but Castellucci has done something quite different with Mahler’s 90-minute Second Symphony, known as the “Resurrection.” Rather than short episodes, here there is a single, almost unremitting action: We watch a United Nations team silently excavate a site where a catastrophe has taken place.
0~What Happened in Ferguson?~Witnesses Told Grand Jury That Michael Brown Charged at Darren Wilson, Prosecutor Says The most credible eyewitnesses to the shooting said the teenager had charged toward Officer Darren Wilson just before the fatal shots, the St. Louis County prosecutor said.
0~Israeli Summit Mixes Historic Symbolism With Sharp Disputes~SDE BOKER, Israel — For all its powerful geopolitical symbolism, the first-ever multilateral Arab-Israeli summit on Israeli soil was a largely transactional affair. The meeting of the top diplomats of Israel, the United States and four Arab countries at a resort hotel in the Negev Desert on Monday was a marquee event that showcased Israel’s growing legitimacy among Arab leaders who for decades had shunned the Jewish state. The jovial candid photos of the leaders and their high-flown speeches amply testified to the event’s momentousness. But the real business of the hastily arranged summit was urgent diplomacy, spurred by the war in Ukraine and the pending nuclear agreement with Iran: The United States wanted to press the other five countries to take a harder line against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, while they in turn wanted American assurances that Iran would be constrained. The 18-hour summit produced no concrete public results, but there were hints of a behind-the-scenes thaw between the United Arab Emirates and the United States after weeks of growing tensions. Washington has been frustrated by the Emirates’ neutral response to the Russian invasion, while Emirati officials were angry at what they see as American indifference to Iranian threats to Emirati security.
0~For Representative Kathy Hochul, Redistricting Raises Hurdle~On May 25, 2011, Kathy Hochul woke up a star. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called her from London with congratulations. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, effusively praised her. News outlets from France, Denmark and Japan all covered the story of how she had pulled off an upset in a Republican district in a closely watched special election. “It was an exhilarating time,” Ms. Hochul recalled. Life is more anxiety-filled these days for Ms. Hochul, who now is the most endangered Democratic House incumbent in New York State and one of the most imperiled in the country, according to political analysts. Redistricting has thrown the 53-year-old freshman into the most conservative district in the state — away from the suburbs of Buffalo and Rochester and into a rural area of farms and villages in a district near the Canadian border. As a result, the woman who rode a wave of anger over a Republican plan to cut Medicare a year ago must convince a primarily Republican electorate that she can represent it and offer an independent voice, regardless of party label.
0~The New York Times~Surveillance, from the French for “watching over,” refers to the monitoring of people by some higher authority — the police, for instance. Now there’s sousveillance, or “watching from below.” It refers to the reverse tactic: the monitoring of authorities (Tony Blair, for instance) by informal networks of regular people, equipped with little more than cellphone cameras, video blogs and the desire to remain vigilant against the excesses of the powers that be. In a primitive form, sousveillance can be traced to 1991, when footage from a home video camera exposed the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King. Today, with the spread of cheap, lightweight cameras and the rise of Web video sites like YouTube, sousveillance has proliferated. The Internet overflows with civilian footage of police abuse in Malaysia, gay-bashing in Latvia and union-busting in Zimbabwe. The Web site HollaBackNYC.com encourages women to post a photo of any man who tries to harass them. A British newspaper even tried to harness the power of sousveillance to better cover the recent political campaign in Britain. Concerned that the Labor Party was insulating Blair from media coverage, The Guardian’s Web site asked its readers for help in keeping track of him. “Limited access means we need your help to keep up with Mr. Blair,” the paper announced. “So today we announce the Blair Watch Project, where we ask you to send us your photos of the P.M. on the campaign trail.”
0~Chicago Teachers’ Strike, Longest in Decades, Ends~CHICAGO — More than 300,000 public school students prepared to return to school as Chicago leaders on Thursday announced an end to an acrimonious teachers’ strike that lasted 11 days, the longest here in decades, and turned life upside down for families across the nation’s third-largest school district. In the end, the clash between the teachers and Chicago’s new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, appeared to have brought mixed results. The city agreed to spend millions of dollars on reducing class sizes; promised to pay for hundreds more social workers, nurses and librarians; and approved a 16 percent salary increase over the coming five years. But not all union members were satisfied; a vote to approve a tentative deal was noticeably split, and some teachers wanted to press on to seek steeper reductions in class sizes, more teacher preparation time and aid for special education. Still, the strike in Chicago, which followed a series of major teacher walkouts in conservative states like West Virginia and Oklahoma as well as liberal cities like Los Angeles and Denver, reflected a renewed wave of activism from teachers. “What it says is that West Virginia and Oklahoma wasn’t sui generis; it wasn’t an isolated moment,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers , who made several trips to Chicago during the strike. “This is now a strategy.”
0~One Trump Victory: Companies Rethink China~BEIJING — Whatever deal Washington and Beijing reach over the trade war, President Trump has already scored a big victory: Companies are rethinking their reliance on China . The two sides are nearing an agreement, with Mr. Trump saying on Thursday that an “epic” trade pact could be weeks away and that he may soon meet with President Xi Jinping, China’s top leader. But already, spurred by tariffs and trade tensions, global companies are beginning to shift their supply chains away from China, just as some Trump administration officials had wanted. The move, known as decoupling, is a major goal of those who believe the world has grown far too dependent on China as a manufacturing giant. As Beijing builds up its military and extends its geopolitical influence, some officials fear that America’s dependence on Chinese factories makes it strategically vulnerable. Now companies in a number of industries are reducing their exposure to China. GoPro, the mobile camera maker , and Universal Electronics, which makes sensors and remote controls, are shifting some work to Mexico. Hasbro is moving its toy making to the United States, Mexico, Vietnam and India. Aten International, a Taiwanese computer equipment company, brought work back to Taiwan. Danfoss, a Danish conglomerate, is changing the production of heating and hydraulic equipment to the United States.
0~Barr Asserts Intelligence Agencies Spied on the Trump Campaign~Mr. Barr’s pledge, made as he prepares to make public in coming days a redacted version of the special counsel’s report on the Russia inquiry, was a sign that after nearly three years of investigating the president’s campaign and Russia, the Justice Department’s focus may begin to shift in a direction that Mr. Trump has demanded. In addition to Mr. Barr’s review of the F.B.I. investigation, the Justice Department’s inspector general, a specially tasked United States attorney and Republicans in Congress are all studying key actions taken during the course of the inquiry. Those actions include how officials opened the Trump-Russia investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, and obtained a secret warrant to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser. Mr. Trump’s thirst for a reckoning among his inquisitors appears to have only grown in recent weeks. Minutes before Mr. Barr took the witness stand on Wednesday, the president called the investigation an “attempted coup” and claimed, again, that he had been “totally exonerated” by the report, despite the fact that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who took over the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation in 2017, explicitly said he could not clear the president of trying to obstruct justice. “It was an illegal investigation,” Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas. In some of his harshest criticism of the investigation to date, Mr. Trump said: “Everything about it was crooked — every single thing about it. There were dirty cops. These were bad people.” “This was an attempted takedown of a president,” he added. “And we beat them. We beat them.” Mr. Mueller delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr. Barr late last month. Much of Wednesday’s hearing, and an earlier session with House lawmakers on Tuesday, was focused on that report, on continuing redactions of delicate information before it becomes public, and on Mr. Barr’s characterization of what Mr. Mueller found.
0~France Announces Tough New Measures on Immigration~PARIS — President Emmanuel Macron of France tried to seize control of the issue of immigration on Wednesday, as his government announced steps to make the country less attractive to migrants while cracking open the door to skilled foreign workers. The combined moves were a bid by Mr. Macron to wrest the issue from his main political challengers, the far-right National Rally of Marine Le Pen, which for years has skillfully used immigration in its political ascent. With critical municipal elections just months away, Mr. Macron has shifted right and begun talking tough on immigration, especially on the perceived abuses of France’s generous social welfare system, hoping to keep Ms. Le Pen’s party, formerly known as the National Front, at bay. Among Mr. Macron’s new get-tough measures is a provision that asylum seekers would have to wait three months before qualifying for non-urgent health care.
0~The Biggest Obstacle to China Policy: President Trump~WASHINGTON — As national security officials and some trade advisers in the Trump administration tried crafting get-tough-on-China policies to address what they viewed as America’s greatest foreign policy challenge, they ran into opposition from an unexpected quarter. President Trump himself was undermining their work. That has been the underlying tension of the last three and a half years, laid out in blunt language in the new memoir by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser. The book supports what administration officials have said in interviews and private discussions since 2017, and what, in many ways, had been out in the open in Mr. Trump’s fawning statements about China’s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping, many made on Twitter. Taken together, the accounts reveal that there has been no coherent China policy, despite efforts early in the administration by senior aides to frame foreign policy around what they labeled “great power competition,” outlined in their own national security strategy document. Administration players on China have been divided by factional feuding and irreconcilable policy goals, with security hawks and religious freedom crusaders butting heads with Wall Street advocates and free traders.
0~Yemen Peace Talks End With No End to Conflict~CAIRO — Days of negotiations in Switzerland to halt the war in Yemen ended on Sunday with no sign of a resolution to the conflict and with the combatants engaged in some of their fiercest fighting in months, according to negotiators and diplomats. The United Nations-brokered talks, which began on Tuesday, were aimed at ending the nine-month war between Yemen’s Houthi rebels and the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. As the talks began, there were reasons for optimism: After several previous attempts to hold negotiations failed, the combatants sat down together for the first time during the conflict, and even agreed publicly to a cease-fire. At the same time, international pressure has been mounting for a resolution to the war, which has left nearly 6,000 people dead and the country crippled by a severe humanitarian crisis. But despite making what the United Nations called “serious progress” in the discussions, repeated violations of the cease-fire appeared to have doomed the current round, according to a statement issued by Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the United Nations special envoy to Yemen. He said that the negotiations would resume in mid-January.
0~A Divided House Endorses Impeachment Inquiry Into Trump~michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today — archived recording (nancy pelosi) The question is on the adoption of the resolution. michael barbaro — the House of Representatives took its first vote to begin an impeachment inquiry into President Trump, launching a new phase of the process, directed at the public. archived recording (nancy pelosi) Those in favor, please say aye. archived recording Aye. michael barbaro Julie Davis on what that phase will actually look like. archived recording (nancy pelosi) Those opposed, say no. archived recording No. michael barbaro It’s Friday, November 1. archived recording Washington, D.C., is once again at the intersection of history on this Halloween morning, October 31, 2019, the U.S. House getting set to do something it hasn’t done in nearly 21 years. And that is begin the official impeachment process in the U.S. House. michael barbaro Julie, for weeks now, we have been talking about an impeachment inquiry, and we have been covering that impeachment inquiry. So what was being voted on Thursday? And why was it being voted on? julie hirschfeld davis So what was being voted on Thursday was a resolution to essentially just lay out the rules for the impeachment inquiry that’s underway and allow the Democrats to take this into the next phase, which is going to be a public phase of their investigation. michael barbaro Right, because what they have been doing has not been public. julie hirschfeld davis Right. And when the Democrats launched their investigation about a month ago, they did not take a vote. And they were pretty clear that they didn’t feel like they had to take a vote. The Constitution doesn’t require one. House rules don’t require one. And privately, they felt like politically, it might not be the easiest vote for some of their members to take. So they had been going along, taking private depositions, collecting their facts. So this was the first time that the full House was actually going to go on the record on the inquiry itself. michael barbaro And why, though? Because if the rules don’t require it, and they were adamant that they didn’t need to do it, why would they subject members to such a vote? julie hirschfeld davis Well, there were practical reasons and political reasons for doing this now. The practical reason is just there are some nuts-and-bolts things that they have to do in order to be able to take this inquiry into a public phase. Politically speaking, though, the public has really, in many ways, if you look at the polls, come around to this idea of having an impeachment inquiry. There’s now a majority in support of the inquiry itself. And many of the more moderate Democrats who had been worried about a backlash from their constituents if they signed on to something like this have already come out in favor of the inquiry. So voting for it is not really advancing them beyond where they already are at this point. michael barbaro In other words, these Democrats are already on the diving board. They might as well just leap into the pool. julie hirschfeld davis That’s right. There’s another reason, though. archived recording In a closed-door meeting — hearing — Marie Yovanovitch told investigators President Trump wanted her out. And his attorney Rudy Giuliani and unnamed contacts wanted her out of the way of their moneymaking opportunities. julie hirschfeld davis There’s been revelation after revelation, bombshell testimony, that have produced some really damaging information about the president — archived recording Bill Taylor sending shockwaves through Capitol Hill, telling Congress multiple administration officials informed him that President Trump personally blocked military aid unless Ukraine agreed to announce investigations into the Bidens. julie hirschfeld davis — and really confirmed some of the underlying aspects of the whistle-blower complaint that started all this about his pressure campaign on Ukraine. And that is what the public has embraced as the reason for the inquiry. But Republicans have, from the beginning, been just railing against Democrats for running this secret process, where the public can’t see or hear for themselves what’s transpiring. Republicans keep saying, it’s illegitimate. This is really a fake inquiry. You haven’t voted on this. So at this point, Democrats were ready to call their bluff and say, O.K., well, if you want an official vote, here’s your official vote. archived recording [GAVEL SLAMMING] The House will be in order. michael barbaro O.K. So that brings us to Thursday morning. Give us the scene inside the House. julie hirschfeld davis So on Thursday morning, in the House chamber, we see Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, ascend to the dais at the front of the chamber, where I don’t remember having seen her since she became speaker in January. archived recording (nancy pelosi) For what purpose does the gentleman from Massachusetts seek recognition? julie hirschfeld davis And then she yields to Jim McGovern, who’s the chairman of the Rules Committee — archived recording (jim mcgovern) Madame Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House resolution 660 and ask for its immediate consideration. julie hirschfeld davis — which is the committee that has drawn up this resolution laying out the impeachment rules. archived recording (nancy pelosi) The clerk will report the resolution. archived recording House calendar number 52, House resolution 660. julie hirschfeld davis And the House parliamentarian starts to read it. And so everyone in the chamber, at this point, can hear what it is they’re going to be voting on. archived recording Upon recognition by the chair for such purpose under this paragraph, during any hearing designated pursuant to paragraph one — michael barbaro Right. And I was watching this, and this is pretty dense stuff. archived recording Notwithstanding clause 2J2 of rule 11 — julie hirschfeld davis It is pretty technical. It is full of resolves and different sections and technical legislative language that refers to different rules of the House. But the gist of it is that, essentially, they’re validating this inquiry that they acknowledge is ongoing. archived recording — to whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach Donald John Trump, president of the United States of America. julie hirschfeld davis They’re saying, we recognize that this is going on. Here are the rules for the coming impeachment proceeding. archived recording One, the chair of the permanent — julie hirschfeld davis And there’s going to be a report that gets issued by the House Intelligence Committee. There are going to be public hearings that go on. And so, essentially, what they’re doing is they’re deputizing themselves as the House of Representatives, the House Intelligence Committee in particular, to be the fact-finders in this investigation. In past impeachments of sitting presidents, what we’ve seen is, they get a report from somewhere. They get some investigative material. And that becomes the grounds for whether they’re going to consider articles of impeachment. But in this case, the House itself is the fact-finder. The House Intelligence Committee is charged with coming up with the information and giving it to the Judiciary Committee and carrying on this process, where they’re going to decide whether this is worth impeaching the president or not, and if there are going to be articles of impeachment, what they should say. michael barbaro Right. In the past, there has been an independent investigator that actually was appointed by the executive branch, something around the president, like a Ken Starr in the case of the Clinton impeachment, or like a Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation. That’s where the report would come out, not Congress. julie hirschfeld davis Right. And this is a very different case, where you have an allegation that actually was initially sent. The whistle-blower complaint that started all of this was referred to the Justice Department at one point. And they declined to investigate it. And so clearly, Democrats have made the decision. They made it a month ago that they were going to be the ones to investigate it and have now essentially made themselves in charge of putting together a report like that on their own. michael barbaro Right. These rules reflect what House Democrats believe is a reality, that if the Trump administration won’t investigate the whistle-blower’s complaint, won’t investigate this call with the president of Ukraine, then we will. julie hirschfeld davis Right. And also, an acknowledgment that it’s not enough for them to just investigate it to their own satisfaction. They actually have to produce a document that they can show the public that explains, if they do decide to go forward with impeachment, why they’re doing it. archived recording (jim mcgovern) Madame Speaker, for the purposes of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. — michael barbaro O.K. So once these nitty-gritty guidelines are laid out, what happens next? julie hirschfeld davis So what happens next is a very passionate 45-minute debate — archived recording (doug collins) This is a dark day, and a cloud has fallen on this House. julie hirschfeld davis — between Republicans and Democrats over this resolution. It’s not about the chapter and verse of the parliamentary details. But it’s really about the impeachment inquiry itself. archived recording (steve scalise) This is the United States of America. Don’t run a sham process, a tainted process, like this resolution ensures. It ought to be rejected. And I think — archived recording Gentleman’s time’s expired. archived recording (steve scalise) — you’ll see bipartisan rejection of this resolution. archived recording Gentleman from Massachusetts — archived recording (steve scalise) And I yield back the balance of my time. julie hirschfeld davis So the Republicans say that this process has been broken from the very beginning. It’s tainted. archived recording (jim jordan) Trying to put a ribbon on a sham process doesn’t make it any less of a sham. archived recording (debbie lesko) This impeachment process is a total sham. julie hirschfeld davis You’ve been conducting these hearings in secret. archived recording (debbie lesko) The resolution continues — the closed door meetings that blocks entry to members of Congress and prohibits the president’s due process rights. julie hirschfeld davis You’ve not been fair to us, and you’ve not been fair to the president. archived recording (liz cheney) — so far. No matter what my colleagues say about this legislation, no matter what my colleagues say about the process they’ve been engaged in to date, it is absolutely the case that it has been a secret process that has denied rights to the minority, that has involved leaking selectively things that the majority would like to have leaked, in which rights have absolutely been denied. And they cannot fix that. They cannot fix what has been a tainted record and a tainted process by now suddenly pretending they’re opening it up. julie hirschfeld davis And there’s no way now to go take a vote on the House floor and just wave a magic wand and make it fair, because it’s not been fair from the beginning. It’s not been legitimate. And now, at the last second, you’re trying to cloak it in this cloak of legitimacy. And it’s just not going to work, because this is a sham process. And it can’t be remedied. archived recording (michael mccaul) Speaker Pelosi claims she wants to establish rules and transparency. You cannot make your game fair by allowing the opposing team onto the field at the two-minute warning. julie hirschfeld davis They’re also basically saying that — archived recording (devin nunes) It’s clear that since the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, they have always intended to transform the Intelligence Committee into the impeachment committee. julie hirschfeld davis Let’s be honest here, Democrats, you have wanted to get rid of President Trump since he was sworn in, since he was elected. archived recording (devin nunes) First, they insisted that the president is a Russian agent. Then they claimed he’s a money launderer and a tax cheat and a fraudulent businessman. And now they’ve decided they don’t like the way he talks to foreign leaders. julie hirschfeld davis This is just one more effort to essentially undo the results of the 2016 election. You didn’t like them. And you are trying to reverse the will of the people. And Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, even says — archived recording (kevin mccarthy) Why do you not trust the people? Why do you not allow the people to have a voice? julie hirschfeld davis You have no right to come in here and start this process that essentially nullifies an election. archived recording (doug collins) The curtain is coming down on this House because the majority has no idea about process and procedure. They’re simply after a president. I yield back. julie hirschfeld davis And finally, Republicans said that these rules, they don’t give the president a fair shake. They don’t give Republicans the same rights even that they’ve had in previous impeachments. And therefore we would never vote for them anyway, even if we thought that this was a legitimate thing to do. michael barbaro And Julie, is that true? I noticed several of these House Republicans saying — archived recording (tom cole) The process laid out in the resolution before us is different from the process used for both President Nixon in 1974 and President Clinton in 1998. michael barbaro — that the rules set forth on Thursday were not as robust for the minority party as rules put in place in the Nixon and the Clinton impeachment processes. Is that right? julie hirschfeld davis It is accurate for now, insofar as the House is in an investigative phase of this inquiry. And in the House Intelligence Committee, there is no right for the president to defend himself. There’s no right for his counsel to ask questions. But as soon as this moves into the realm of the Judiciary Committee, and they’re actually considering articles of impeachment, that is when a lot of these rights and responsibilities that are outlined in the rules kick in. And so Democrats say, and if you just look at the procedures from today and from back then, they are very similar. The Republicans do have the right to ask for subpoenas of witnesses and testimony to ask questions. And yes, it is the case that the Democrats, as the majority party, have more say over that process than the Republicans will. But the rights are really there as soon as they get into the phase of this process that is impeachment articles against the president. archived recording (jim mcgovern) Madame Speaker, I get it. My friends on the other side of the aisle want to talk about process, process, process. But it’s interesting that not one of them wants to talk about the president’s conduct. And that speaks volumes. michael barbaro And what’s the case, Julie, that the Democrats are making? They have, of course, written these rules. And they’re very much in charge of this process. julie hirschfeld davis Right. So the Democrats are trying to make a very somber case about this being not a political process but really, their duty as people who have taken an oath to the Constitution. archived recording (jerry nadler) I support this resolution not because I want the allegations to be true — they sadden me deeply — but because if they are true, the Constitution demands that we take action. julie hirschfeld davis This is the way they’re going to defend the Constitution, and that they have to hold the president accountable, that it’s their role as the House of Representatives — archived recording (hakeem jeffries) We don’t work for this president or any president. We work for the American people. julie hirschfeld davis — to dig into what happened and uphold the Constitution. And this is, they’re saying, the only way to do it. archived recording (hakeem jeffries) We have a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on an out-of-control executive branch. julie hirschfeld davis They also really take aim at the way the president and Republicans have targeted the witnesses so far who have appeared behind closed doors. archived recording (james clyburn) Some dedicated public servants have demonstrated their patriotism to this great country by coming forward and testifying and giving us the information as they know it. These brave patriots have been called career radical unelected bureaucrats. They’ve been called that by a group of people who Thomas Paine would call summer soldiers and sunshine patriots. julie hirschfeld davis These people are serving their country. They’re upstanding people and essentially defending the nuts and bolts of what they’re learning here in this inquiry. archived recording (mark desaulnier) After today, there are no more excuses for those who want to ignore the facts and instead — of defending the Constitution. And there are no more excuses for those who turn a blind eye while the president pressures foreign actors to interfere with our democracy. julie hirschfeld davis So essentially, trying to make it really hard to dismiss the revelations that have come out so far and promoting their own role in having brought that all forth. And as the debate is wrapping up, Speaker Nancy Pelosi gets up to speak. archived recording (nancy pelosi) I thank the gentleman for yielding. And Madame Speaker, thank you for the recognition. julie hirschfeld davis She has a placard next to her of the American flag. archived recording (nancy pelosi) I proudly stand next to the flag, and I thank the gentleman from New York for providing it for us. This flag — so many have fought and died for this flag, which stands for our democracy. julie hirschfeld davis And she talks about the legislative branch and what their role is. archived recording (nancy pelosi) And the genius of that Constitution was the separation of powers. Any usurping of that power is a violation of our oath of office. julie hirschfeld davis And clearly, the case that she’s making is that impeachment is a constitutional endeavor. archived recording (nancy pelosi) And this Constitution is the blueprint for our republic and not a monarchy. So what is at stake is our democracy. What are we fighting for? Defending our democracy for the people. julie hirschfeld davis What we’ve been hearing from Republicans throughout this debate is the political aspect of impeachment, which is undeniable. But she’s really trying to spotlight the constitutional nature of this process and trying to get people to focus on that. And so that is essentially the case that she makes. And she wraps up, and she says, what is at stake is nothing less than our democracy. archived recording (nancy pelosi) And that is how we will honor our oath of office. I urge an aye vote and yield back the balance of my time. archived recording Gentlelady yields back. michael barbaro Julie, I wonder what struck you about all of these speeches at this moment in the day, Democratic and Republican — probably something like two dozen or so of these. julie hirschfeld davis I think what we saw was two parties talking past each other. And that was the most striking element. And to me, it just really spoke profoundly of what we are about to see unfold here as the impeachment goes public, that you are going to have this real battle with the Republicans and Democrats, both in their partisan corners, in many ways talking past and around each other about what is really going on here. archived recording I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. I yield back my time, and I move the previous question of the resolution. michael barbaro So once these speeches are all done, what happens next? julie hirschfeld davis So after all the speeches are over, there is a procedural vote, where Republicans essentially tried to block the resolution from coming up altogether. And that fails. And then it’s time for the big vote. [music] julie hirschfeld davis Guys, I’m getting called by the desk. I think I’m — michael barbaro Are you going to — julie hirschfeld davis I might have to jump. michael barbaro O.K. You think you’ll be able to come back in? And we probably — julie hirschfeld davis Yeah, I do. Well, let me just go upstairs and see what’s happening. And then I might be able to come down in, like, 10 minutes. michael barbaro O.K. Cool. julie hirschfeld davis O.K. michael barbaro Bye. We’ll be right back. So Julie, what happens in his vote? julie hirschfeld davis So when it’s time for the vote, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, goes up to the rostrum in the front of the House chamber. It’s very unusual for the speaker of the House to actually preside, especially during a vote. archived recording (nancy pelosi) The question is on the adoption of the resolution. Those in favor, please say aye. julie hirschfeld davis And she essentially asks for the yeas and nays. archived recording Aye. archived recording (nancy pelosi) Those opposed, say no. archived recording No. julie hirschfeld davis And then Republicans ask for a roll call vote. archived recording Madame Speaker — archived recording (nancy pelosi) Resolution is adopted. The gentleman — archived recording On that, I would request the yeas and nays. julie hirschfeld davis They ask for the actual yeas and nays by electronic vote. So essentially, what happens is, the back wall lights up with red and green lights next to all the names. And you can see in real time how they’re all voting. archived recording (nancy pelosi) This is a five-minute vote, colleagues. A five-minute vote. julie hirschfeld davis The whole gallery at this point is filled with members of the public who are there to witness this historic vote. And — archived recording (nancy pelosi) On this vote, the yeas are 232. The nays are 196. The resolution is adopted without objection. The motion to reconsider is laid upon the table. julie hirschfeld davis The resolution is passed. And as it turns out, no Republicans decide to cross party lines. They all vote no. And only two Democrats oppose it. michael barbaro And who are those two Democrats? And were they expected to oppose it? julie hirschfeld davis The two Democrats were Collin Peterson, a congressman from Minnesota, and Jeff Van Drew, who’s from New Jersey. Collin Peterson has been in the House for decades. Jeff Van Drew is a first-term Democrat from a very conservative district in southern New Jersey. And he had signaled before the vote that he was going to be a no. He’s been very much against impeachment. He’s said that Democrats shouldn’t even be talking about it. It’s a waste of time. He’d rather talk about policy. And so it was pretty clear that he was going to oppose this. Collin Peterson is also a pretty conservative Democrat. He, interestingly, voted in favor of opening the inquiry into former President Bill Clinton back in 1998. But he was one of the two to vote no today. michael barbaro So this is as partisan and party line a vote as you can have in Congress. julie hirschfeld davis That was, I think, what Democrats expected it to be. But it was also a necessary exercise, I think, because now they can move forward and actually put this impeachment inquiry into its next phase. michael barbaro So now that these rules have passed in the House, and the impeachment inquiry is operating in this new phase, under these new guidelines, what does that actually look like? julie hirschfeld davis The hope is that they can move very quickly to public hearings. And those would feature some of the witnesses we’ve seen appearing behind closed doors, like Ambassador Bill Taylor, who is the top diplomat in the Ukraine, Fiona Hill, Gordon Sondland, and there is a national security official who is still in the White House, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, and they think he would make a really compelling figure to take people through what this pressure campaign on Ukraine looked like and the ways in which foreign policy was being bent in the interests of achieving President Trump’s political goals. This is going to be very substantive questioning in long rounds by staff investigators, who are essentially trying to press to get the clearest possible account of what transpired. michael barbaro It sounds like this is going to be a type of congressional hearing we’re not really used to seeing. julie hirschfeld davis That’s right. And I think the hope for Democrats is that people are really going to sit riveted and watch every moment, because they have been reading and hearing about these accounts for now several weeks. But they haven’t gotten a chance to really hear and see them firsthand. And so it’s really important for Democrats to have these people describe what they saw on camera in a way that the public can understand, and then also so that they can draw up this report that they’re hoping to present. And then at some point, they will draw up articles of impeachment. They’re actually already being debated and deliberated over now. What would that look like? And there would be an official vote in the Judiciary Committee to send those to the full House sometime in early December, they’re hoping, by late in the month. But that’s obviously a lot of moving parts, a lot of boxes to check before they can get to an actual vote on impeaching President Trump. michael barbaro And that is just the House process. When that is wrapped up, it sounds like by the end of the year, it then would head to the Senate. julie hirschfeld davis Right. They would then have formally charged the president. And the impeachment articles would move to the Senate for a trial. michael barbaro Julie, if you are the House Democratic leadership, I wonder, does what happened on Thursday look like a pretty successful strategy that’s finally come to life? Or is this just a massively risky political wager for the Democrats that could end up jeopardizing their majority in the House, make it impossible for them to retake the Senate, and maybe even complicate their chances of winning the White House? julie hirschfeld davis I think it is a massively risky endeavor for Democrats. But I also think it’s one that they concluded, over these many weeks, was inescapable, that they have gotten to a point where their members — Nancy Pelosi and almost all of her rank and file — feel that the public is behind having an impeachment inquiry, that they’re not doing their jobs and shirking their responsibilities if they don’t do it, and that at the very least, if they can’t convince any Republicans to join them in supporting this, which it certainly looked from today like they won’t be able to, that they can at least persuade the public that there was some misconduct here, that there was some unpresidential behavior here. And if President Trump is not removed, that they will at least have made their best possible case for why he shouldn’t be president. michael barbaro So Julie, how should we think about the significance of what ended up happening today in the House of Representatives? julie hirschfeld davis Well, it was really a historic vote. It was only the third time in modern history that the House has voted on an impeachment inquiry. And it really did put the House on this path to impeach the president, to actually pass articles of impeachment. There is very little chance now that the House Democrats will ultimately opt out of bringing articles of impeachment against President Trump. And so it’s put them on this road to a very significant process. michael barbaro Right. It feels like, in a way, there’s no going back, at this point. julie hirschfeld davis That’s right. [music] julie hirschfeld davis On paper, this was a vote about setting rules for considering articles of impeachment, if the House decides to do that. But in reality, it was a vote that makes it very clear that the House is going to bring articles of impeachment against President Trump. And the only real question is whether he’ll be convicted in the Senate. michael barbaro Thank you, Julie. julie hirschfeld davis Thank you, Michael. michael barbaro We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. In testimony before impeachment investigators, the National Security Council’s top expert on Russia became the latest official to describe a quid pro quo, in which the president withheld U.S. military aid in order to pressure Ukraine’s president to investigate Trump’s rivals. The expert, Tim Morrison, described a conversation in which Trump’s ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, explained that the military aid to Ukraine would not be released until Ukraine committed to investigating Democrats. That testimony now corroborates a central claim in the impeachment inquiry. And — archived recording (katie hill) This is the last speech that I will give from this floor as a member of Congress. I wasn’t ready for my time here to come to an end so soon. It’s a reality I’m still grappling with, and I will be for a long time to come. michael barbaro Representative Katie Hill, a freshman Democrat from California, resigned from Congress on Thursday in an emotional speech from the House floor. Hill had faced a House ethics investigation into allegations she had a sexual relationship with a member of her congressional staff, a violation of congressional rules. Hill has denied having a relationship with a congressional staff member but has acknowledged a separate relationship with a member of her campaign team, a relationship that was the subject of graphic leaks to the news media that Hill said originated from her husband. archived recording (katie hill) To the thousands of people who spent hours knocking doors in the hot summer sun, who made countless phone calls, who sacrificed more than I could ever know to give everything they could in every possible way so that I could be here, I am so, so sorry. michael barbaro
0~Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Pedestrian in Arizona, Where Robots Roam~Uber, Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their self-driving vehicles in cities around the country. The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation. But the technology is still only about a decade old, and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face. It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of self-driving vehicles on public roads. Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment. Some states, like Arizona, have taken a lenient approach to regulation. Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on self-driving technology out of neighboring California, where regulators had been less receptive. [Read more on how Arizona became a destination for self-driving car tests.] But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately. In April, California is expected to follow Arizona’s lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the driver’s seat. Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch. A Senate bill, if passed, would free autonomous-car makers from some existing safety standards and pre-empt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws. Similar legislation has been passed in the House. The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasn’t reached a full floor vote.
0~Bob Dylan’s Secret Archive~Classics from the 1960s appear in coffee-stained fragments, their author still working out lines that generations of fans would come to know by heart. (“You know something’s happening here but you,” reads a scribbled early copy of “Ballad of a Thin Man,” omitting “don’t know what it is” and the song’s famous punch line: “Do you, Mister Jones?”) The range of hotel stationery suggests an obsessive self-editor in constant motion. And while the archive is a further step in the canonization of Mr. Dylan, now 74, as not just a musical icon but also an American literary giant, the documents are tantalizing in what they do not reveal. A card from Barbra Streisand postmarked November 1978, for example, thanks Mr. Dylan for sending flowers and playfully suggests that they make a record together; there is no evidence of a response. For longtime students, seeing the archive may conjure a familiar feeling of astonishment at just how deep the well of Dylanology goes. There is always far more beneath the surface than anyone could guess. One example of this phenomenon — and of how radically the material could change existing Dylan scholarship — is the “Blood on the Tracks” material. The “little red notebook,” which by most accounts was stolen from Mr. Dylan at some point, circulated among collectors and is now held at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, with access severely restricted. But the existence of two more books shows how much raw material has been unavailable and unknown for study. The song “Tangled Up in Blue,” with its refracted scenes of a wanderer haunted by a broken relationship, gets a slightly more picaresque telling here, with a refrain absent from the finished recording: “Wish I could lose, these dusty sweatbox blues.” Even in songs that have been pored over for decades, new layers of meaning await discovery.
0~Amid Tight Security, Virginia Gun Rally Draws Thousands of Supporters~RICHMOND, Va. — Some people streamed in on buses from faraway cities. Others drove cars through the night from places like Indianapolis and Fredericksburg, Texas, logging hundreds of miles and leaning on coffee and Red Bull. Still others came from only a few counties over, but carrying the same vehement message as the rest: Leave gun laws alone. Thousands of people descended on Richmond, the capital of Virginia, on Monday to show support for the rights of gun owners as a push for gun control measures by that state’s newly empowered Democrats has inserted Virginia into a nationwide debate over gun violence and the Second Amendment. “I don’t like what they are doing to our rights,” said Raymond Pfaff, 85, from Louisa County, Va., who wore a yellow sign around his neck that read, “First Gun Control and Then People Control.” “Guns protected this country for a couple of hundred years, and this two-faced governor just wants to take them,” he said, referring to Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat who has agreed to sign provisions banning guns in parks and limiting handgun purchases if Virginia lawmakers approve them.
0~Joe Biden, His Son and the Case Against a Ukrainian Oligarch~“Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer,” she said. “The vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company. The vice president has pushed aggressively for years, both publicly with groups like the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum and privately in meetings with Ukrainian leaders, for Ukraine to make every effort to investigate and prosecute corruption in accordance with the rule of law. It will once again be a key focus during his trip this week.” Ryan F. Toohey, a Burisma spokesman, said that Hunter Biden would not comment for this article. It is not known how Mr. Biden came to the attention of the company. Announcing his appointment to the board, Alan Apter, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker who is chairman of Burisma, said, “The company’s strategy is aimed at the strongest concentration of professional staff and the introduction of best corporate practices, and we’re delighted that Mr. Biden is joining us to help us achieve these goals.” Joining the board at the same time was one of Mr. Biden’s American business partners, Devon Archer. Both are involved with Rosemont Seneca Partners, an American investment firm with offices in Washington. Mr. Biden is the younger of the vice president’s two sons. His brother, Beau, died of brain cancer in May. In the past, Hunter Biden attracted an unusual level of scrutiny and even controversy. In 2014, he was discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine use. He received a commission as an ensign in 2013, and he served as a public affairs officer. Before his father was vice president, Mr. Biden also briefly served as president of a hedge fund group, Paradigm Companies, in which he was involved with one of his uncles, James Biden, the vice president’s brother. That deal went sour amid lawsuits in 2007 and 2008 involving the Bidens and an erstwhile business partner. Mr. Biden, a graduate of Georgetown University and Yale Law School, also worked as a lobbyist before his father became vice president.
0~A Canal Through Turkey? Presidential Vote Is a Test of Erdogan’s Building Spree~ISTANBUL — From soaring bridges to a giant mosque to plans for the world’s biggest airport, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has used gargantuan building projects as an engine of growth and a signature way of leaving an indelible stamp on his nation. As he campaigns for re-election on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan has promised his most ambitious project yet: a canal that would bisect the country and create a Turkish-owned trade route, which he says would make Turkey a great power and leave a legacy for the history books. “What makes Panama is the Panama Canal,” Mr. Erdogan told supporters at a rally in Istanbul last weekend. “Suez is the biggest source of revenue for Egypt. Let’s have a vote. God willing the Istanbul Canal will be another fresh breath for our city.” The election is shaping up as an up-or-down vote on how Mr. Erdogan has transformed Turkey during 15 years in charge. He has amassed sultanlike powers, jailed political enemies and trimmed civil liberties, even as average annual economic growth of 5 percent has spawned and nurtured a middle class.
0~Joe Biden Called Anita Hill After Prodding. But He’s Still Not Apologizing.~A former vice president known for — “My love affair with Amtrak.” “Back on Amtrak” — and his famous friend. “This also gives the internet one last chance to talk about our bromance.” Joe Biden is running for president. “Today, I am announcing my candidacy for president of the United States. He’s tried it before. “And with the grace of God and the support of the American people, I mean to be that kind of president.” Twice. “This is not about experience. It’s not about change. It’s about action.” So, why does he think the third time’s a charm? Biden may be betting that in this politically tumultuous time, voters are looking for a familiar face. He arrived in Washington before C-Span existed and before these members of Congress were born. His credentials are unmatched in the Democratic Party. He served two terms as vice president, 36 years in the Senate and has chaired powerful congressional committees. And he’s earned himself a few nicknames along the way. “Working-Class Joe.” “Working-Class Joe Biden.” “Old Uncle Joe Biden.” “Crazy Uncle Joe Biden, just being Biden.” So, what are Biden’s priorities? He’s a moderate Democrat and is likely to focus on: expanding health care, investing in education and rebuilding relationships with allies. “The America I see does not wish to turn our back on the world or our allies. We will be back.” But his decadeslong record comes with some baggage, including his support for the Iraq war. “President Bush is right to be concerned about Saddam Hussein’s relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction.” Tough anti-crime policies. “First, we have to join together to ensure that drug dealers are punished swiftly, surely and severely.” And his role in the Anita Hill hearing. “It is appropriate to ask Professor Hill anything any member wishes to ask her to plumb the depths of her credibility.” More recently, several women have come forward saying they were uncomfortable with the way Biden touched them. “I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders, get up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head.” Biden responded on Twitter. “The boundaries of protected personal space have been reset and I get it. I will be more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space. So, how has Biden taken on President Trump? They’ve had their share of fighting words. “If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” Trump shot back on Twitter, and said Biden “would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.” Biden later said he regretted his comments. So, what are Biden’s odds? He entered the race as an instant front-runner and he’s already leading in early polls. But as a white man in his late 70s, Biden’s test will be whether his popularity can outweigh the party’s thirst for generational change.
0~‘Watchmen’ Pulls the Hood on Hooded Justice~This article contains spoilers for Season 1, Episode 6 of HBO’s “Watchmen.” Who was that masked man? In this week’s episode of “Watchmen,” the show pulls back the hood on one of the story’s most elusive figures, the brutal vigilante called Hooded Justice. A peripheral but pivotal figure in the original graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, Hooded Justice was the very first masked vigilante hero in the “Watchmen” universe, responsible for launching the phenomenon that inspired all the others to don masks of their own. The big surprise? Underneath that hood and noose, so evocative of the Ku Klux Klan, was a black cop and survivor of the Tulsa Race Massacre, Will Reeves. Employing a mask and a rope that his racist fellow police officers had used to terrify and intimidate him, he turned the terror back onto criminals — including those crooked cops. The revelation elevates a background player from the graphic novel to the status of protagonist, and in the process it raises as many questions as it answers. Does this surprising secret identity jibe with what we know from Moore and Gibbons’s original book? The showrunner Damon Lindelof — despite having made what he has called a “remix” of the book — claims to treat it as gospel. Could the racist iconography of Hooded Justice have been a ruse all along? We dug back into the source material to see if the case for a placing black man beneath that menacing hood holds up. [Read our recap of Episode 6.] (Note: DC Comics has published a series of prequel stories under the “Before Watchmen” umbrella and is currently serializing a sequel. Lindelof does not treat those projects as canon, so they’re impossible to reconcile with the TV series. We’ll be ignoring them here as well.)
0~Democrats, Pushing Stimulus, Admit to Regrets on Obama’s 2009 Response~“This time, the feeling was, ‘We’re not very willing to negotiate what we think is needed,’” said former Senator Byron Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota who retired ahead of the 2010 midterm elections. “In 2009, I think the feeling was, ‘Oh we wanted more, but we didn’t get what we wanted.’” The careful dance around Mr. Obama and his accomplishments continues a dynamic from the Democratic presidential primary. While taking care not to disparage his administration, several candidates stressed the need for the party to embrace a more take-no-prisoners political approach with Republicans; others criticized Mr. Obama’s policies on immigration: though he used an executive order to aid the Dreamers, he also pushed deportations and border detentions. It also highlights the rapid change in Washington over a decade of partisan brawling. Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden came into office on promises of unity and bipartisanship in the face of an economic crisis, but Mr. Biden is the beneficiary of a changed landscape in the party. Democrats are now more cognizant of Republican obstruction, less deferential to the deficit hawks and energized by a growing progressive wing that has pulled the party’s ideological midpoint to the left. A decade ago, Mr. Obama’s strategy reflected the Democratic Party’s mainstream, an insistence on negotiating with Republicans, keeping the Senate filibuster and trimming his own ambitions for a nation that he and others worried could handle only so much change after electing its first Black president. Now, the progressive criticism of that posture has become party canon. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a leading progressive voice, said the changes should be attributed partly to the growth of the left, but partly to an inadequate Democratic response to the Great Recession, which she said “created so much damage economically, for people, but it also created a lot of political damage for the party” by not being larger in scope.
0~Kyrie Irving Doesn’t Know if the Earth Is Round or Flat. He Does Want to Discuss It.~What do you think drives you to be a little bit of a contrarian? I’ve definitely wanted — well I know I am — a generational leader. To do that, it takes a long, long time of learning about other human beings, history and incorporating all that into things that I love. Do you have a project that you are interested in trying out? I am more or less trying to start my own production company, trying to collaborate with great influencers, people that inspire me. It’s just the ground level now but that’s the focus, becoming a content creator. That’s the hope of owning my own television network one day. You want to own your own television network? Oh, absolutely. What would be on it? See, that’s exactly what I’m trying to figure out. I just know that television, where it is now, there’s a certain sense of authenticity that I want to bring to audiences that are representative [of] what is going on in the world and in our culture. I don’t necessarily know how to capture that content as of right now, but I will figure it out. You talked about wanting to be different. I’ve got to ask — and I know you get asked about this quite often — is that why you made suggestions about the Earth being flat? Is it a part of you wanting to be different? No, I would say at the time when I was talking about it, I had literally been just given so much flak about what I felt, the way the shape of the Earth is. And it garnered so many different opinions; well, of course, the perception was going to be like, “Hey man, you’re just crazy, man, for thinking that.” What I would say is that just exemplified exactly what I meant on the intent of wanting to be different. Because when you think something completely different, science has proven it, everyone has thought and believed this to be true, and then you say something on the opposing side, and it gets a reaction that’s not necessarily authentic at all. There’s just a “Hey, let’s get this preconceived notion about who he is as a person,” you have no idea. I really wanted to put that on the biggest stage of “now it becomes your side vs. my side.” At the end of the day, does it really matter?
0~Michael Montano and Dantley Davis to Leave Twitter in Shake-Up~Twitter’s new chief executive, Parag Agrawal, said on Friday that he would reorganize top leadership at the company and that two key executives would depart. The shake-up was the first sign of change under Mr. Agrawal, who took the reins of the social media company on Monday after its co-founder and chief executive, Jack Dorsey, announced his resignation. Twitter has been under pressure from investors to introduce new products more quickly and add to its revenue, and Mr. Agrawal said in an email to Twitter employees that the leadership changes were designed to accelerate Twitter’s pace. Twitter’s head of engineering, Michael Montano, and its head of design and research, Dantley Davis, will leave by the end of the year. Mr. Davis had championed a culture change at Twitter that pushed staff for higher performance and that some employees criticized as bullying.
0~Vanderbilt Son Recalled as Man With High Ideals~Carter Cooper, who leaped to his death from the penthouse apartment of his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, was eulogized yesterday as a young man who moved through life with grace, affirming ideals and principles he believed in. ''If we hold his principles for him, if we dream his dreams for him, if we ennoble what we touch for him, then this reeling world will become a better place, a place of civility,'' said James Stewart, who said he had taught and advised Mr. Cooper at the Dalton School. Among the 2,000 mourners who listened to Mr. Stewart describe Mr. Cooper were the First Lady, Nancy Reagan, a longtime friend of his mother; the director Sidney Lumet, a former husband of Miss Vanderbilt; the designer Bill Blass; the magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes; the actress Dina Merrill, and the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, Helen Gurley Brown. Some of the others who attended were Princeton University classmates of Mr. Cooper, some wearing orange-and-black ties emblazoned with the school mascot, a tiger. Mr. Cooper graduated last year. Mr. Cooper jumped from a ledge of Miss Vanderbilt's Gracie Square apartment on the Upper East Side last Friday after she tried to talk him out of it, the police said. Mr. Cooper, who went to his mother's apartment for lunch, had been under treatment recently for depression, the police said . He left no suicide note. Mr. Cooper was 23 years old.

0~Talking Points Brought to Trump Tower Meeting Were Shared With Kremlin~Natalia V. Veselnitskaya arrived at a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 hoping to interest top Trump campaign officials in the contents of a memo she believed contained information damaging to the Democratic Party and, by extension, Hillary Clinton. The material was the fruit of her research as a private lawyer, she has repeatedly said, and any suggestion that she was acting at the Kremlin’s behest that day is anti-Russia “hysteria.” But interviews and records show that in the months before the meeting, Ms. Veselnitskaya had discussed the allegations with one of Russia’s most powerful officials, the prosecutor general, Yuri Y. Chaika. And the memo she brought with her closely followed a document that Mr. Chaika’s office had given to an American congressman two months earlier, incorporating some paragraphs verbatim. The coordination between the Trump Tower visitor and the Russian prosecutor general undercuts Ms. Veselnitskaya’s account that she was a purely independent actor when she sat down with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, then the Trump campaign chairman. It also suggests that emails from an intermediary to the younger Mr. Trump promising that Ms. Veselnitskaya would arrive with information from Russian prosecutors were rooted at least partly in fact — not mere “puffery,” as the president’s son later said.
0~Turing Pharmaceuticals Accused of Retaliating for Sex Assault Complaint~Ms. Retzlaff, who still works for the company as its chief commercial officer, has been on the front lines in dealing with the reaction to Turing’s pricing policies in the months since the controversy began. In front of Congress in February, for example, she said that the fiftyfold overnight increase in the price of the drug, Daraprim, was justified because of the value it provided to patients and because it had been previously underpriced. With two decades of experience at major pharmaceutical companies like Bayer and Pfizer, she presented a polished counterpoint to the antics of Mr. Shkreli, who has seemed to delight in inciting outrage and remains a prankish figure on Twitter. In the complaint, filed on Monday with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Ms. Retzlaff said she and other Turing executives traveled to Washington in March for another hearing before Congress on Turing’s pricing practices. At the hotel bar, the complaint says, she was approached by Mr. Urrutia, who made sexual advances and tried to kiss her. According to the complaint, which was obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Retzlaff left the bar and took the elevator back to her room, but Mr. Urrutia followed her and blocked her way when she tried to exit, demanding that she join him in his room for a drink. When she did, she said, “he threw me onto the bed and sexually assaulted me.” Ms. Retzlaff said she was groped and that he repeatedly kissed her against her will, then tried to pull off her tights. “Finally, after struggling for many minutes, I was able to escape Mr. Urrutia and run out of the room,” she said in the complaint. Mr. Urrutia, who was Turing’s interim chief financial officer, worked as an analyst at a handful of banks before going to work at Mr. Shkreli’s previous company, Retrophin, as vice president of finance, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is a graduate of Northeastern University with a bachelor’s degree in finance.

0~Unemployment Benefits to Millions Are About to End~“They should not cut these benefits off until there is a vaccine for all the little humans of all ages, because there are parents like me that have children that are high risk for Covid,” she said. Inflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. Ms. Rinehart is one of nearly half a million Pennsylvanians who will lose their benefits this weekend, according to estimates from the Century Foundation, a progressive research institute. The state has an unemployment rate of 6.6 percent, well above the national rate of 5.4 percent. Pennsylvania, like the country as a whole, has experienced a significant economic rebound, but a partial one: Domestic tourists this summer again lined up to see Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, and thrill-seekers again rode the roller coasters at Hersheypark. But many downtown offices in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh remain all but empty, and conventioneers have not yet returned to conference hotels, or to the restaurants and bars that relied on their business. Overall, Pennsylvania has regained about two-thirds of the jobs lost in the pandemic, compared with about three-quarters nationally. “There’s been a partial recovery in a lot of the industries that are shut down, but it’s not back to where it was,” said Barney Oursler, director of the Mon Valley Unemployed Committee, a workers’ rights group in Pittsburgh. The committee was formed in the 1980s in response to layoffs in the steel industry; it has had a second life in the pandemic, helping thousands of Pennsylvanians navigate the state’s unemployment system. Mr. Ocheret, 32, is a professional oboist in Philadelphia. Before the pandemic, he cobbled together a living as a freelancer, performing with symphonies and opera companies up and down the Eastern Seaboard, and picking up the occasional gig with pop artists who wanted onstage orchestra sections. It all dried up almost overnight in March 2020. Performances began to return this spring, and Mr. Ocheret recently picked up a once-a-week gig that will last into September with an orchestra in New Jersey. But his calendar remains sparse this fall, and without unemployment benefits to fall back on, he isn’t sure how he will get by. He has signed up for computer coding courses to give him another option — one that he doesn’t want to take, but that he says he may have to consider if the industry doesn’t rebound by the end of the year. “I hate to stop doing the thing I love,” Mr. Ocheret said. “But if things don’t start to improve, I may have to do something different.”
0~Denmark Toughens Rape Law to Include Sex Without Consent~Denmark toughened its rape law on Thursday by criminalizing sex without explicit consent, a long-awaited victory for assault survivors and human rights groups. In order to bring a rape charge, the law previously required proof of violence, threat or evidence that the victim was unable to fend off the assault. But the new legislation broadens the definition. “Now it becomes clear that if both parties do not agree to sex, then it is rape,” Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup said after lawmakers unanimously approved the measure, which takes effect on Jan. 1. Denmark regularly leads indexes on gender equality and access to justice. Its sexual assault laws already criminalized marital rape, and the legal definition of rape includes acts other than sexual intercourse.
0~Cuomo Aides Rewrote Nursing Home Report to Hide Higher Death Toll~In response to a detailed list of questions from The Times sent on Tuesday, the governor’s office responded with a statement Thursday night from Beth Garvey, a special counsel, who said “the out-of-facility data was omitted after D.O.H. could not confirm it had been adequately verified.” She added that the additional data did not change the conclusion of the report. The tension over the death count dated to the early weeks of the pandemic when Mr. Cuomo issued an order preventing nursing homes from turning away people discharged from the hospital after being treated for Covid-19. The order was similar to ones issued in other states aimed at preventing hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. But by late spring, Republicans were suggesting that the order had caused a deadly spread of the virus in nursing homes. Mr. Cuomo disputed that it had. Still, critics and others seized on the way the state was publicly reporting deaths: Unlike other states, New York excluded residents who had been transferred to hospitals and died there, effectively cloaking how many nursing home residents had died of Covid-19. The 33-page report, which was issued in July by the state Health Department, found Mr. Cuomo’s policies were not to blame, but it became a turning point in the Albany debate over the governor’s policies. The day after the report was published, legislators began calling for hearings and requesting complete data. Public health officials criticized its approach. A think tank began seeking the data the next month, as did the Justice Department. Health officials, nursing home operators and even some of Mr. Cuomo’s aides expressed bafflement at the governor’s apparent insistence on delaying the release of the data for so long, as none of the information released so far has changed the overall number of Covid-19 deaths in New York — now more than 47,000, including more than 15,000 nursing home residents. But the July report allowed Mr. Cuomo to treat the nursing home issue as resolved last year, paving the way for him to focus on touting New York’s success in controlling the virus.
0~Painkiller Abuse, a Cyclical Challenge~Devising policy to manage the competing uses and risks of narcotic painkillers has been a century-long challenge, complicated by shifts in the government’s approach to drug regulation, the nation’s culture of illicit drug use and the role played by the pharmaceutical industry. The most recent wave of opioid overuse can be traced back to at least the 1980s. Then, some doctors began reporting that addiction to them was rare, and drug companies vigorously promoted them as safe for a broad range of painful conditions. In a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1980, Dr. Jane Porter reported that out of nearly 12,000 patients who had received a narcotic painkiller, only four became addicted. In a 1986 study published in the journal Pain, Dr. Russell Portenoy — at the time, a prominent proponent of narcotic painkillers whose work was backed by drug manufacturers — reported that only two of 24 patients treated with them for years had exhibited problems managing the medication. Other physicians expressed concern that by withholding opioid drugs, physicians could be under-treating pain. Encouraged by these findings, doctors who once thought long-term use of narcotic painkillers was unsafe began to prescribe them in greater numbers. In 1993, The Times reported that chronic pain sufferers were now able to find relief with powerful narcotic drugs. “There is a growing literature showing that these drugs can be used for a long time, with few side effects and that addiction and abuse are not a problem,” Dr. Portenoy said. In 1996, the American Pain Society — of which Dr. Portenoy would later be president — termed pain the “fifth vital sign,” to be routinely measured in patients along with the four traditional ones: body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate. Measurement of pain — for instance with a self-reported zero-to-10 rating — was recognized as a prerequisite to taking it seriously and treating it. Model guidelines developed in 1998 and updated in 2004 were widely adopted by state medical boards and codified the use of opioids as standard pain treatment practice. For pain sufferers, these were welcome developments. The pharmaceutical industry also helped promote greater use of the narcotic medications it sold. It funded the American Academy of Pain Management and the American Pain Society. Pain clinics expanded, some funded by grants by companies that produced the narcotic painkillers they dispensed.
0~Insularity Cuts 2 Ways for Britain~Each conflict, moreover, seems to have reinforced Britain’s sense of a separate, insular destiny, more comfortable with distant cousins across the Atlantic than neighbors close by. Shortly before the D-Day landings of 1944, Churchill told the French general Charles de Gaulle that every time Britain had to “decide between Europe and the open sea, it is always the open sea that we shall choose.” “Every time I have to decide between you and Roosevelt,” he said, referring to the wartime U.S. president, “I shall always choose Roosevelt.” It took a while for de Gaulle to conjure a riposte as he opposed Britain’s entry to the European club in 1963. “England is an island, maritime, and linked through its trade, markets and food supplies to very diverse and often distant countries,” he said. “In short, the nature and structure and economic context of England differ profoundly from those of the other states of Europe.” Recent events have proved both men right. In 2003, Britain sided with the United States in the invasion of Iraq against the express opposition of a European coalition of the unwilling led by France. To this day, Britain’s financial services industry — the so-called City of banks and investment houses — is driven far more by the sharp-elbowed model of Wall Street than by any European equivalent in Frankfurt, Paris or Milan. Indeed, much of Mr. Cameron’s veto of a broader treaty was designed to shield the traders of the City from closer European intrusion and taxation. For all that, the debate is shaded by a peculiar quandary. Britain is not a member of the euro zone. Indeed, there is a discernible smugness among British leaders when they point out that, as the yield on some European bonds clicked up to unsustainable levels, British debt remained relatively cheap — a token of the market’s confidence in the standalone pound sterling. But, for all the evocations of the doughty British bulldog, Britain cannot simply stand alone: half of its trade is with Europe, anchoring its economic interests across the Channel.
0~How Emergent BioSolutions Put an ‘Extraordinary Burden’ on the U.S.’s Troubled Stockpile~That was how many BioThrax doses the government had committed to stockpiling, and it was the backbone of Emergent’s thriving business. In pursuit of that goal, the government had already spent more than $900 million, and it continued to buy virtually every dose Emergent could produce. It had even awarded the company more than $100 million to expand its Michigan factory. “That’s your taxpayer dollars at work,” Mr. Burrows told the gathering, according to a transcript of the event. But just three years later, Emergent’s business was under threat. Unlike smallpox or the coronavirus, anthrax doesn’t spread from person to person, instead infecting people when its spores are released in the environment. The main defense against it is the kind of cheap, commonly used antibiotics that were dispensed after the 2001 letter attacks, also kept in the stockpile. How Times reporters cover politics.

Emergent’s vaccine, given in three doses, would be useful for emergency workers and others who might risk extended exposure to the spores. But for the general public, it would be an added precaution, multiple health officials said. “The best approach toward anthrax is antimicrobial therapy,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, told Congress as early as 2007. So government officials started asking: Did the stockpile need so much of the vaccine? The government already had part of the answer. Health officials had hired the disaster-preparedness firm I.E.M. to calculate how much benefit the vaccine provided. In an analysis published in 2007, the firm determined that giving antibiotics immediately after a large outdoor anthrax attack was likely to reduce serious illnesses by more than 80 percent. Administering the vaccine would then cut serious illnesses only by an additional 4 percent. Dr. Sid Baccam, who led the I.E.M. team, said the analysis was regularly updated through 2016 with similar results. “I think it’s pretty clear that the benefit of the vaccine is marginal,” he said in an interview. The Emergent spokeswoman said the I.E.M. study did not reflect the totality of research, and suggested the government considered “many different factors” when choosing what to purchase.
0~Este es el calendario del proceso de certificación que Trump trata de interrumpir~En Michigan, el Consejo de Escrutadores Estatales ha programado una reunión el lunes para revisar y certificar los resultados previamente certificados por los consejos de escrutinio de cada condado. A pesar de las protestas republicanas sobre la certificación de los resultados en el condado de Wayne, que incluye Detroit, se espera que el estado certifique a tiempo. Trump ha invitado a los legisladores republicanos de Michigan a la Casa Blanca el viernes, y su campaña intenta abiertamente bloquear el proceso de certificación con la esperanza de conseguir que los legisladores estatales republicanos anulen a millones de votantes de Michigan y nombren unos electores pro-Trump para el Colegio Electoral. No es probable que los legisladores lo hagan. Pero incluso si así fuera, la gobernadora Gretchen Whitmer, demócrata, podría certificar una lista de electores separada y pro-Biden. Entonces le correspondería al Congreso elegir entre ambas listas, y los abogados electorales dicen que la ley federal favorecería a la de la gobernadora, incluso si el Congreso se estancara en un punto muerto. El Congreso también podría, en teoría, desechar completamente los votos electorales de Michigan, en cuyo caso Biden aún ganaría el Colegio Electoral. Martes 24 de noviembre: Minnesota, Nevada, Carolina del Norte En Nevada, que Biden ganó, la Suprema corte del estado se reunirá el 24 de noviembre para certificar los resultados. Al final, el gobernador deberá confirmar el resultado. La campaña de Trump ha presentado una demanda sin fundamento en la que afirma que Trump ganó en Nevada, y los grupos conservadores tratan de anular los resultados, pero es muy improbable que estas afirmaciones lleguen a algún lado. Este es también el plazo de certificación para Minnesota y Carolina del Norte, ninguno de los cuales se espera que sea polémico. Biden ganó Minnesota; Trump ganó Carolina del Norte. Sábado 28 de noviembre: Ohio Este es el plazo para que Ohio, que ganó Trump, certifique sus resultados. No se esperan impugnaciones. Lunes 30 de noviembre: Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska Arizona tiene que certificar sus resultados para esta fecha, al igual que Iowa y Nebraska. Biden ganó en Arizona, Trump ganó en Iowa, y en Nebraska, Trump ganó en todo el estado pero Biden ganó un voto electoral en el segundo distrito del Congreso del estado.
0~Trump Says Jobs Report Made It a ‘Great Day’ for George Floyd, Stepping on Message~“What you now see, it’s been happening, is the greatest thing that can happen for race relations,” Mr. Trump said, “for the African-American community, for the Asian-American, for the Hispanic-American community, for women, for everything.” He rolled his eyes when she asked how the unemployment numbers for blacks and Asian-Americans could be declared a victory. “You are something,” Mr. Trump told her, refusing to answer as he tried to sign a piece of legislation relaxing restrictions on small-business loan recipients. The president also ignored a question from another reporter who asked how a better economy would have protected Mr. Floyd. Instead, Mr. Trump trained his focus on the need to reopen the country and on the jobs report as evidence of what moving past the coronavirus and reopening would do. It would be like a hurricane that “goes away, and within two hours, everyone is rebuilding and fixing and cleaning and cutting their grass.” The president said Americans should “do social distancing, and you wear masks if you want,” but he made clear he was happy to leave the pandemic behind. Health experts, including those in the Trump administration, have warned that the United States is not in the clear. Officials are still confirming more than 20,000 new cases a day as testing expands and new hot spots appear. “Even you,” Mr. Trump said to reporters assembled there, “I notice you’re starting to get much closer together, looks much better, not all the way there yet but you’ll be there soon.” The White House Correspondents’ Association said later that White House officials violated federal social distancing guidelines by moving chairs in the Rose Garden closer together before the event.
0~As They Console Coronavirus’s Victims, Italy’s Priests Are Dying, Too~ROME — On the Sunday before Easter, the priest’s phone rang. The Rev. Claudio Del Monte carried the phone, given to him by staff in the Bergamo hospital, along with a small cross and some homemade sanitizer. Instead of his usual cleric’s collar, he wore disposable scrubs, a surgical mask covered with another mask, protective eyewear and a cap over his head. On his chest he had drawn a black cross with a felt pen. He excused himself from two coronavirus patients he was visiting in the hospital and answered the call. But he already knew what it meant. Minutes later, he arrived at the bedside of an older man he had met days earlier. An oxygen mask now obscured the man’s face, and intensive care staff huddled around his bed. “I blessed him and absolved him from sins, he squeezed my hand tightly and I stayed there with him until his eyes closed,” Father Del Monte, 53, said. “And then I said the prayer for the dead, and then I changed my gloves and continued my round.”
0~Coroner’s Error in Canada Bus Crash Brings Hope to One Family, Despair to Another~SASKATOON, Saskatchewan — One family’s hope was extinguished and another’s was renewed on Monday, after Saskatchewan’s coroner’s office acknowledged that it had mixed up the identities of a survivor and a victim of a violent bus crash that has shaken this province and all of Canada. The collision between a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos hockey team and a tractor-trailer truck loaded with packaged peat moss killed 15 members of the team and its staff, and injured 14 others. Early Monday morning the Office of the Chief Coroner for Saskatchewan said in a statement that it had incorrectly declared Xavier Labelle, an 18-year-old defenseman, as dead. He is in a hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. No information about his medical condition has been made public. The coroner said Parker Tobin, the team’s goalie, had not survived. “All I can say is miracles do exist,” Issac Labelle, Xavier’s brother, posted on Facebook. “My deepest condolences to the Tobin family.”
0~Haji Bashir Noorzai, Taliban-Linked Afghan, Gets Life in Drug Case~An Afghan tribal leader convicted in an international narcotics trafficking conspiracy was sentenced to life in prison on Thursday by a judge in New York who rejected pleas for leniency based on the man’s cooperation with the American authorities. The tribal leader, Haji Bashir Noorzai, whose case drew wide attention because of his prominent role in the drug trade and his ties to Mullah Mohammad Omar, the fugitive leader of the Taliban, was found guilty last fall of taking part in a conspiracy that sent millions of dollars’ worth of heroin around the world, including into the United States. He came to New York in 2005 to meet with American officials, lured, he said, by two government contractors who said the Americans wanted to talk with him about terrorism financing, and promised him safe passage home. Instead, after 11 days of talks with federal agents, he was arrested. Speaking through a Pashto interpreter on Thursday, Mr. Noorzai told the judge emphatically, “In all my life, I never did anything against the United States government, against the United States people and against the United States legal system.”
0~Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg Battle Over Confiscating Assault Weapons~“Congressman O’Rourke, in the last debate you said, quote ‘Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.’ But when you were asked how you would enforce a mandatory buyback you said police wouldn’t be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don’t even know who has those weapons.” “I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now. We don’t go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law.” Congressman — congressman, you just made it clear that you don’t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it. But we can’t wait. People are dying in the streets right now. We cannot wait for purity tests, we have to just get something done.” “You say we’re so close. We have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013 when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation and it didn’t pass because of the filibuster. We have got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibuster or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens.” “The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that are on the street — or not on the street — that people own, is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon.” “When I’m elected I’ll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don’t, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country because it is time to act.” “Seventy-seven percent of Americans agree on licensing. We don’t need leadership right now. We just need folks that are going to stand up and follow where the people already are.” “There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell’s desk: The background check bill, my bill to close the boyfriend loopholes so domestic abusers don’t get guns, the bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That’s what we should be focusing on. And I just don’t want to screw this up.”
0~U.K. Economy Needs Stronger Unions and Higher Taxes on Rich, Report Says~Britain needs sweeping changes to redress its economic failings, rising inequality and the corrosive legacy of the financial crisis, according to a report from a committee that included the Most Rev. Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. The group outlined a 10-year plan for the sort of transformation experienced twice in Britain in the last century: once after the Second World War, when the state expanded its influence, and then in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher unleashed the free market to jolt the economy. Commissioned by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a British public policy institute, the report, “Prosperity & Justice: A Plan for the New Economy,” landed just as Britain is grappling with its looming exit from the European Union, or Brexit, a move that has already slowed investment and dampened economic growth. Instead of focusing on Brexit itself, the document tried to tackle some of the factors that prompted the 2016 referendum and the resulting decision to quit the European Union. That vote, the report said, “was a stark repudiation of the status quo and crystallized profound feelings of economic injustice.”

Deutsche Bank, which has been Mr. Trump’s primary lender for two decades, and Signature Bank, are also seeking distance from him and his business. Deutsche Bank has decided not to do business with Mr. Trump or his company in the future, according to a person familiar with the bank’s thinking. Charles Schwab went further, saying it shut down its PAC, citing a “hyperpartisan environment. “We believe a clear and apolitical position is in the best interest of our clients, employees, stockholders and the communities in which we operate,” the company said. The company’s PAC will no longer take contributions from employees or make financial contributions to lawmakers. Charles Schwab said in its statement that it was confident its “voice will still be heard in Washington” even without a PAC, noting that it is a “major employer in a dozen metropolitan centers.” Other companies that do not have a PAC, like IBM, have said they do not think a lack of one puts them at a political disadvantage. Visa temporarily suspended all its political donations through its PAC as it reviews its candidate contribution guidelines, a spokesman said. American Express and Mastercard said they had suspended political contributions to politicians who had tried to block the certification of the election results. “Last week’s attempts by some congressional members to subvert the presidential election results and disrupt the peaceful transition of power do not align with our American Express Blue Box values,” Stephen J. Squeri, the American Express chief executive, wrote in a memo to staff.

Apart from heating up toast, this underrated kitchen gadget can handle many other foods, like roast chicken, steak, fresh bread, crispy potatoes and even cake. A good countertop oven often outperforms a full-size one because its smaller cavity enables it to heat up faster and maintain consistent temperatures more easily. Your electricity bill will probably drop, too, if you have an electric full-size range. Last but not least, the countertop oven recently became an interesting tech product category. Over the last two years, tech companies like June and Tovala and household brands like Whirlpool have invested in software-powered heating methods that cook foods more efficiently, requiring less culinary know-how.
0~Afghan Contenders Accept Results and Move On~KABUL, Afghanistan — The two remaining candidates for president of Afghanistan said on Thursday that they accepted the final results of the first round of voting, which eliminated their other rivals, and they vowed to campaign hard to win the election in a runoff. However, the timeline announced by the nation’s election commission will leave the country without a new president until late summer. Voters will cast their runoff ballots on June 14, with final results to be announced on July 22. Under Afghan election law, the new president would then be inaugurated 30 days later, officials said. The dates matter to the United States and other Western countries, where military planners are hoping to determine as soon as possible what will happen after the current United Nations mandate for their forces in Afghanistan expires at the end of the year. Both candidates have said they will sign the bilateral security agreement that has already been negotiated with the United States, and which provides for the continuing presence of American troops. The current president, Hamid Karzai, has refused to sign it before he leaves office, leaving the matter to his successor.
0~Why the Toughest Sanctions on Russia Are the Hardest for Europe to Wield~As for the gas that is already flowing to Europe, Western leaders are reluctant to reduce it further given that during the last three months of 2021, Russia shrank its pipeline exports by close to 25 percent compared with a year earlier, according to the International Energy Agency. Europe’s reserves stand at just 30 percent, and Europeans are already paying exorbitant prices for energy. The conflict is occurring when supplies of both oil and natural gas have been tight for months, driving up prices. “There are serious concerns” that Moscow will tighten exports further and send prices higher, said Helima Croft, head of commodities at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank. Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in Europe, gets 55 percent of its supply from Russia. Italy, the second-biggest trading partner, gets 41 percent. At a forum in Milan last week, the Russian ambassador Sergey Razov said President Vladimir V. Putin had told the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, that “if Italy needs more gas we are ready to supply it.” Mr. Putin also made a point of saying that roughly 500 Italian businesses have operations in Russia and that bilateral investments are worth $8 billion. Austria, Turkey and France are large consumers of Russian natural gas. In central and Eastern Europe, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are the biggest customers, the Russian energy giant Gazprom said.
0~Trump Will Withdraw U.S. From Paris Climate Agreement~Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the agreement for environmental action signed by 195 nations is a remarkable rebuke to heads of state, climate activists, corporate executives and members of the president’s own staff, who all failed to change his mind with an intense, last-minute lobbying blitz. The Paris agreement was intended to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures in concert, and the departure of the Earth’s second-largest polluter is a major blow. Mr. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the United States, and the administration said he had placed calls to the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Canada to personally explain his decision. A statement from the White House press secretary said the president “reassured the leaders that America remains committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and to robust efforts to protect the environment.” But within minutes of the president’s remarks, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement saying that the Paris climate accord was “irreversible” and could not be renegotiated. The decision was a victory for Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, and Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who spent months quietly making their case to the president about the dangers of the agreement. Inside the West Wing, the pair overcame intense opposition from other top aides, including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Ms. Trump, in particular, fought to make sure that her father heard from people supportive of the agreement, setting up calls and meetings with world leaders, corporate executives and others. But by Thursday, aides who pushed to remain part of the agreement were disconsolate, and it was Mr. Pruitt whom the president brought up for victory remarks at the Rose Garden event.
0~With Pickets, Russian Protesters Look to Sustain Momentum~With the wind and sweeping rain pushing yellow leaves along the sidewalks on Saturday, there was a feeling of fall in the air. With it came the question of whether the protests could be sustained past the Sept. 8 elections that had inspired them. For some, the answer was decidedly yes. The protests have not really focused on President Vladimir V. Putin as such, but the question of what comes after him looms in the background. Mr. Putin is not allowed to seek a fifth term as president after 2024. This month signifies 20 years since Mr. Putin was appointed prime minister under President Boris N. Yeltsin, with little expectation that the former K.G.B. foreign intelligence officer would have much staying power. But Mr. Putin has remained the main figure in Russia ever since, even during the four-year interlude when term limits forced him to cede the presidency and become prime minister before retaking power in 2012. That sleight of hand inspired the previous round of large street protests, which Mr. Putin ended with a combination of harsh crackdown and renewed nationalism. The 2014 annexation of Crimea fueled a surge in support for him that has now worn off. Mr. Putin’s fallback position has always been that, without him, the chaos of the 1990s would return. At the forefront of the current protests, however, is a younger generation that was either schoolchildren in the 1990s or not even born. Mr. Putin is the only leader they have ever known, and for them the protests are more about shaping their country.
0~After Microsoft, Bringing a High-Tech Eye to Professional Kitchens~BELLEVUE, Wash.  Inside a nondescript warehouse on a nondescript street of this Seattle suburb is a research laboratory that looks like it came out of a James Bond movie  had Q the gadget master been a gastronome. Here Nathan Myhrvold, a former chief technology officer at Microsoft, and his company, Intellectual Ventures, pursue an eclectic array of speculative and potentially world-changing ideas  inventing a new battery, taming hurricanes, defeating disease. And here, along with the laser designed to shoot mosquitoes out of the air (a high-speed camera counts the rate of wing-flapping to ensure that innocent insects are not vaporized), is the best-equipped restaurant kitchen anywhere that never serves any customers. Dr. Myhrvold exuded a Willy Wonka enthusiasm as he talked of the foods that came out of his industrial food dehydrator. “Raw lobster tail, freeze dried, is amazing,” he said. At another machine, rose petals spun inside a glass globe. “This is basically a still,” he said. “You could crank the temperature up and distill alcohol. What we’re trying to do here is get an essence of rose petals.”
0~‘Where Do I Find Your Hand Sanitizer?’ Sorry, We Have None.~Most health officials and disease specialists say one of the best preventive measures against the coronavirus or any other outbreak is frequent washing of hands, using soap and water to scrub fronts, backs and between fingers for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren’t available, health professionals say, then hand sanitizer can be used, as long as it contains at least 60 percent alcohol and the gel is squirted onto the hands and rubbed briskly all over them for about 20 seconds. In some cases, the demand is outstripping inventory. On Amazon, for instance, a search for popular hand sanitizer brands like Purell, Germ-X or even Amazon’s private-label brand, Solimo, showed many were unavailable. In some cases, what was available was being sold by third-party sellers at high prices. On Friday morning, a pack of two 12-ounce bottles of Purell could be had from a third-party seller for $49.99. Amazon did not respond to emails seeking comment about its supply of hand sanitizers and how it handles third-party sellers that may be price-gouging customers. Walmart’s website also showed many hand sanitizers as out of stock. Those that were available appeared to be from other parties selling them at high prices. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
0~Before Oprah’s Interview With Harry and Meghan, Royal Accusations Fly~A spokeswoman for the couple called the allegations an “attack” on the character of the American former actress — all the more painful because she “has been the target of bullying herself.” Buckingham Palace, however, said it was “very concerned” about the allegations, would look into them and invited former staff members of the couple to take part in the investigation “to see if lessons can be learned.” The spectacle of the royal family conducting a human-resources investigation of one of its most famous in-laws left longtime observers of the monarchy slack-jawed. They predicted it would lead to further embarrassing disclosures, since the palace did not act on the complaint at the time, and other people who worked in the palace might take it as an invitation to lodge their own charges of mistreatment. “They have opened an unbelievable can of worms,” said Peter Hunt, a former royal correspondent for the BBC. “Are they really going to find her guilty of bullying? Will it be in the form of a #MeToo investigation? It really feels like the anarchists have taken over the institution.” To some extent, the charges and countercharges represent a clash of cultures: the old-fashioned press leaks of the British media — long used by members of the royal family or their allies to settle scores — versus the publicity machine of an American television network and one of the nation’s most powerful media personalities. CBS and Ms. Winfrey’s company, Harpo Productions, have stoked expectations for the interview, which will be broadcast in Britain on Monday by the ITV network, with peekaboo excerpts that show her seated with Harry and Meghan in a relaxed outdoor setting, but offer only glimpses of what they are talking about.
0~When the President Travels, Who’s Allowed to Join Him?~When the president goes on a trip, he takes a varied entourage. A group of his senior aides accompanies him, usually including national security, domestic or economic advisers, speechwriters and others, depending on the length of the trip and its purpose. But 13 members of the news media, known as the protective press pool, also take seats on Air Force One, representing the worlds of wire services, print newspapers, news sites, broadcast television and radio, as well as photographers. In the Washington news media’s often contentious battle for scoops, the press pool represents a kind of sportsmanship by necessity. Only a few seats can be spared on the plane, so the print and television poolers must represent the entirety of their disciplines and send out a series of short, to-the-point reports throughout the trip to those not on it. The White House Correspondents’ Association manages a rotation of news organizations that travel at their own cost, and it is explicitly understood that the poolers must share all the material they gather, without keeping anything they’ve seen or heard for an exclusive story. “Pool duty is kind of the ultimate mixed blessing,” said Mark Landler, who has been a White House correspondent for The Times since 2011. It offers close access to the president, but it can be stressful: Poolers are expected to quickly send their reports to 10,000 people or more, usually via iPhone, and the accuracy of quotations and descriptions in those reports is paramount. “And you’re often doing it in very difficult circumstances,” Mr. Landler said. “Getting in and out of motorcades, sometimes climbing in and out of helicopters, rushing to finish the pool report before you get on Air Force One.”
0~Director of M.I.T.’s Media Lab Resigns After Taking Money From Jeffrey Epstein~“After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately,” Mr. Ito wrote in an email on Saturday to M.I.T.’s provost, Martin A. Schmidt. Mr. Ito’s resignation came less than a day after an article in The New Yorker described the measures that he and other media lab officials took to conceal its relationship with Mr. Epstein. The internal emails, which a former media lab employee shared with The New York Times, described the handling of donations that Mr. Epstein made and apparently solicited from the rich and powerful over the years, including a $2 million gift from the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. In an email in October 2014 — six years after Mr. Epstein had pleaded guilty to a sex charge involving a minor in Florida — Mr. Ito wrote that the gift from Mr. Gates had been “directed by Jeffrey Epstein.” A development official at the media lab, Peter Cohen, wrote in a subsequent email, “For gift recording purposes, we will not be mentioning Jeffrey’s name as the impetus for this gift.” In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Gates said Mr. Epstein had been introduced to Mr. Gates as a person interested in helping increase philanthropy. “Although Epstein pursued Bill Gates aggressively, any account of a business partnership or personal relationship between the two is simply not true,” the statement said. “And any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grant making for Bill Gates is completely false.” Mr. Gates — one of the world’s richest men and perhaps its most generous philanthropist — is one of many powerful people to face scrutiny for their connections to Mr. Epstein. President Trump and former President Bill Clinton have been forced to explain their associations with him. So have Britain’s Prince Andrew, high-profile scientists and business executives including Leslie Wexner, the chief executive of L Brands, and Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management, one of the world’s biggest private equity firms. R. Alexander Acosta, who as a federal prosecutor was involved in the plea agreement with Mr. Epstein in 2008, stepped down as labor secretary after that deal was heavily criticized.
0~Houston Doctor Fired for Giving Away Doses of Covid Vaccine~Dr. Gokal, 48, immigrated from Pakistan as a boy and earned a medical degree at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. After working at hospitals in Central New York, he moved to Texas in 2009 to oversee the emergency department at a suburban Houston hospital. His volunteer work has included rebuilding homes and providing medical care after Hurricane Harvey in 2017. In recent years, Dr. Gokal split his time between two area hospitals. But when the pandemic hit in early 2020, he lived for a month in a hotel and an apartment rather than risk infecting his wife, Maria, 47, who has pulmonary sarcoidosis, a disease in her lungs that leaves her winded after even minimal activity. “I was petrified to go home and bring Covid to my wife,” he said. Fortunately, he said, the Harris County Public Health department recruited him in April to become the medical director for its Covid-response team. The job paid less, but he was eager to protect his wife by limiting his exposure to the coronavirus in emergency rooms. On Dec. 22, Dr. Gokal joined a conference call in which state health officials explained the protocols for administering the recently approved Moderna vaccine. The 10 or 11 doses in a vial are viable for six hours after the seal is punctured. Dr. Gokal said the advice was to vaccinate people eligible under the 1(a) category (health care workers and residents in long-term-care facilities), then those under the 1(b) category (people over 65 or with a health condition that increases risk of severe Covid-related illness). After that, he said, the message was: “Just put it in people’s arms. We don’t want any doses to go to waste. Period.” On Dec. 29, a mild Tuesday, Dr. Gokal arrived before dawn at a park in the Houston suburb of Humble to supervise a vaccination event intended mostly for emergency workers. In part because of minimal publicity, the pace was slow, with no more than 250 doses administered. But this was the county’s first public event, he said. “We knew there would be hiccups.”

0~Women and the Covid-19 Vaccine: What You Need to Know~News that a small number of women had developed a rare blood clotting disorder after receiving Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine prompted questions about whether vaccines affect women differently than men, and whether there are special considerations that women should take into account when getting vaccinated. We spoke with a few experts to learn what women should know before getting their shots. The blood clots appear to affect women more than men. In April, federal health agencies recommended that practitioners pause administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after a half-dozen women developed a rare blood clotting disorder about two weeks after vaccination. There have been more cases since then, and nearly all of them have been in adult women younger than 50 years old. The blood clotting disorder has been found to be so rare, however, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on April 23 that use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine resume because the agency said the benefits outweighed the risks. If you do receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a serious condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome during the three weeks following vaccination: Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision Shortness of breath Chest pain Leg swelling Persistent abdominal pain Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin Getting vaccinated can change the way your mammogram looks. Coronavirus vaccinations can cause enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit that will show up as white blobs on mammograms. This type of swelling is a normal reaction to the vaccine and will typically occur on the same side as the arm where the shot was given, said Dr. Geeta Swamy, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’s Covid vaccine group. It usually lasts for only a few weeks.
0~Trump Administration Imposes New Sanctions on Putin Cronies~Friday’s penalties could be particularly painful for Mr. Putin’s regime. While Russia’s oligarchs make nearly all of their money in Russia, many stash their families, their lovers and much of their wealth in places like London, New York and Miami, where they are believed to own hundreds of millions of dollars in property. However, the economic strain is likely to be delayed, given that most on the list have already shielded their assets. Targeted sanctions against the oligarchs are seen as a particularly good way to punish Moscow’s aggressive moves while sparing wider Russian society, which is already suffering under Mr. Putin’s thumb. The sanctions come just three days after Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, in his final speech as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, warned darkly about the growing Russian menace. “For too long some nations have looked the other way in the face of these threats,” he said, adding, “And we have failed to impose sufficient costs.” The new sanctions stem from legislation passed by Congress overwhelmingly last year and designed to limit Mr. Trump’s ability to lift sanctions already imposed on Russia. Lawmakers in both parties feared that the president would suspend sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama as he pursued warmer relations with Moscow as promised during his campaign and first year in office. The Trump administration opposed that legislation but quietly acceded to it after it passed with a veto-proof majority. Within that law was a measure requiring the administration to create a list of Russian oligarchs. Lobbying around the creation of the list became intense as Russia’s wealthiest citizens feared punishing sanctions to come. That is exactly what happened on Friday. The sanctions list will only hasten the slide of Washington-Moscow relations. This week, 60 American diplomats left Russia as part of a tit-for-tat series of expulsions that followed last month’s nerve-gas poisoning of Sergei V. Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter.
0~Corporate America Doesn’t Want to Talk Abortion, but It May Have To~Even more recently, corporate leaders were reminded of how fraught engagement can be. Disney, for example, faced internal backlash when its leadership declined to take a strong stance against Florida’s Parental Rights in Education act, which critics often refer to as the “Don’t Say Gay” law. But when the chief executive did take a public stance, the company was crucified on social media, and the state revoked its special tax benefits. Now, with the expected demise of the country’s landmark abortion law, corporate leaders are confronting the hottest of hot-button issues. In a Pew Research poll in 2021, 59 percent of Americans said they believed that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 39 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. People on all sides of the issue feel strongly about it, with nearly a quarter of Americans saying they will vote only for candidates who share their views on abortion, according to Gallup. That all adds up to many reasons a company would want to avoid making any statement on abortion — and all the more reason that customers and workers could come to see it as necessary. A company’s position on the end of Roe could have repercussions for how it hires in an increasingly competitive labor market, and how customers view its brand. “Abortion is a health care issue, health care is an employer issue, so abortion is an issue for employers,” said Carolyn Witte, chief executive of Tia, a women’s health care company. On Tuesday, Tia announced that it would provide medication abortions through its telemedicine platform in states where it operated and where doing so was legal. For some major companies that have been known to weigh in on political and social issues, this week has been unusually quiet. Walmart, Disney, Meta, PwC, Salesforce, JPMorgan Chase, ThirdLove, Patagonia, Kroger and Business Roundtable were among the companies and organizations that declined to comment or take a position, or did not respond to requests for comment about whether they plan to make public statements about their stance on abortion. Hobby Lobby, which in 2014 brought a suit to the Supreme Court challenging whether employer-provided health care had to include contraception, made no public statement and did not respond to a request for comment. Other companies did wade in. United Talent Agency said it would reimburse travel expenses for employees affected by abortion bans. Airbnb said it would ensure its employees “have the resources they need to make choices about their reproductive rights.” Levi Strauss & Company, which has said its benefits plan will reimburse employees who have to travel out of state for health care services such as abortions, said abortion was a business issue.

0~Ireland Abortion Vote: ‘It’s Not a Man’s Issue,’ but Male Turnout Is Crucial~Aoife O’Sullivan, wearing a “Yes” badge in favor of repealing the amendment, stopped by an anti-abortion booth where rubber figurines showing the various stages of fetal development were on display. She quickly fell into a debate with an opponent over what kind of life a child of a rape victim would face. “A child needs all the love it deserves,” Ms. O’Sullivan said. “But if it’s unwanted and is thrown into a cruel world and it discovers its father was a rapist — imagine how messed up it’ll be.” “I agree,” said Leah Boyle, 22, a “No” campaigner. “We have no idea what its life will be like, but abortion offers no chances,” she said, before recounting that her uncle had been conceived in a sexual assault. When he found out from his mother on her deathbed, “he struggled with depression,” Ms. Boyle said. Still, she added, “he went on to have such a good life. He had four children.” As the vote neared, some voters wavered, including Aoife O’Sullivan. She said that she was the only person in her immediate family to vote yes, and that her parents were upset by her decision. Muiriosa explained the difference in votes with her twin over religion and their attitudes toward diet. “I like religion, whereas Aoife has a more relaxed approach. I am a vegan and Aoife is a meat eater,” she said. “I do not believe in the killing of any creature on this Earth. Likewise, it is our duty as compassionate human beings to stand up for the killing of babies and vote no.” Aoife, for her part, admitted to liking meat very much. Aside from teaching rowdy high school students, she is part of Ireland’s national weight lifting team and is expected to compete in Canada after Friday’s vote. “I feel empowered,” she said. “For my sister, this is a moral issue. For me, it’s the right, the right for a woman to go through or not with a pregnancy,” she said. “You cannot make a judgment until you’re in that position.”
0~In Texarkana, Uninsured and on the Wrong Side of a State Line~“I’m sure, anecdotally, that some people will move,” said Benjamin Sommers, an assistant professor of health policy and economics at the Harvard School of Public Health and a co-author of the study. “But is this a major budget issue for states expanding Medicaid? Will there be a major wave of people moving to get insurance? Probably not.” The disparities among states have left about eight million low-income adults ineligible for Medicaid and have widened the difference in what federal safety-net benefits are available to similar families in different states. There are a number of border communities where one state is expanding Medicaid and the other is not: West Memphis, Ark., and Memphis; Chicago and Gary, Ind.; Washington’s Maryland suburbs and those in Northern Virginia; and Spokane, Wash., and Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. Perhaps nowhere is the anomaly clearer, though, than in two-state Texarkana. This close-knit community, with about 66,000 residents altogether, has two mayors, two fire departments and two police departments. The Texas side is dry; liquor stores abound on the Arkansas side. And every autumn, the fierce high school rivalry between the Texas Tigers and the Arkansas Razorbacks flares anew. “We’re an odd little area down here,” said Prissy Hickerson, a Republican who represents Texarkana in the Arkansas House of Representatives. Image Ed Miller lives in a shelter in Texarkana, Tex. On the Arkansas side he might be insured by Medicaid. Credit... Michael Stravato for The New York Times Both sides of Texarkana are largely middle and lower-middle class; its major employers are big-box stores, hospitals, chicken-processing plants, an Army depot and a tire factory. But unlike much of energy-rich Texas, it has seen its economy stagnate in recent years. Ms. Laurent said she struggled to meet more need with less money; grants and donations to the shelter dropped sharply last year. For the town’s lowest-income residents, finding health care is one more hardship. Ms. Marks had a hole in her tooth this winter, she said, and went to the emergency room. They gave her a painkiller and a bill for $600, which she has ignored. The tooth remains so damaged that she can chew on only one side of her mouth.
0~Mexico’s Zetas Accused of Laundering Money With Horses~The affidavit said the Zetas funneled about $1 million a month into buying quarter horses in the United States. The authorities were tipped off to Tremor’s activities in January 2010, when the Zetas paid more than $1 million in a single day for two broodmares, the affidavit said. The New York Times became aware of Tremor’s activities in December 2011 while reporting on the Zetas. The Times learned of the government’s investigation last month and agreed to hold back this article until Tuesday morning’s arrests. The business was “so far out there it’s hard to believe,” said Morris Panner, a former prosecutor who handled drug cases. “Maybe they were using some kind of perverse logic that told them they could hide in plain sight, precisely because people wouldn’t believe it or question it.” The Treviño brothers devised an elaborate scheme in which Mexican businessmen paid for the horses — some of them worth hundreds of thousands of dollars — from their own bank accounts so the purchases would appear legitimate, according to the affidavit. The Zetas would later reimburse the businessmen, and the horses’ ownership would be transferred to Tremor. The brothers’ activities on either side of the border made for a stark contrast. One week in May began with the authorities pointing fingers at Miguel Ángel Treviño for dumping the bodies of 49 people — without heads, hands or feet — in garbage bags along a busy highway in northern Mexico. The week concluded with José Treviño fielding four Tremor horses in a prestigious race at Los Alamitos Race Course, near Los Angeles. By then, Mr. Villarreal’s story had come to a fatal, fiery end. Not long after the 2010 victory at Ruidoso, he was detained by the Drug Enforcement Administration and reluctantly agreed to work as an informant. Five months later, his charred remains were found in a burnt-out car on the highway outside Nuevo Laredo. The buzz around Tremor’s winnings and acquisitions began three years ago, when José Treviño bought an estimated $3 million in quarter horses, including one named Number One Cartel. Since then he has worked with breeders, trainers and brokers considered pillars of the business. Tremor Enterprises did not always put its name on the horses it owned or the races they ran, presumably to avoid the attention of tax collectors and law enforcement authorities, according to federal agents.
0~Donald Trump to Foreign Workers for Florida Club: You’re Hired~“I want to protect our borders,” he said. “I also want to protect our businesses. They have to come in legally, and then they go back. Certain areas, in really successful areas, where we can’t get help, many people do that. That’s a good thing. Otherwise, you hurt your business.” From Florida resorts to Midwestern farms to Silicon Valley technology companies, the number of guest workers has been growing, even as labor advocates have accused employers of using the programs to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. The Labor Department is investigating whether outsourcing companies hired by Disney used such a program to replace American employees who were qualified and already doing the jobs. In Palm Beach County, Tom Veenstra, senior director of support services at CareerSource, a job placement service, took issue with Mr. Trump’s contention that he could not staff his clubs with locals. “We have hundreds of qualified applicants for jobs like those,” he said. After a report by Reuters in July about Mr. Trump’s use of guest workers, executives from Mar-a-Lago met with recruiters from Mr. Veenstra’s agency, promising to request local workers for 50 positions. But Mar-a-Lago sent over just a single job request, for a banquet server. Mr. Veenstra said CareerSource referred four applicants to the club, and one of them got the job. Since then, Mr. Veenstra said, “we haven’t received any other job orders.” Other clubs in the Palm Beach area on Florida’s east coast, including the Breakers, a well-known beachfront resort near Mar-a-Lago, also use guest workers. Industry experts say they can be attractive to employers because they are essentially a captive work force.
0~Mergers Show Steel Industry Is Still Worthy of Big Deals~"""The transaction we're announcing will change the world's steel map,"" Mr. Ross said in a conference call with analysts and investors. The transaction is Mr. Ross's latest high-profile example of how to thrive in industries that others shun. The back-of-the-envelope calculation is startling: The five deals that created International Steel cost $2.165 billion, including debt. But the total price Mr. Mittal will be paying for International Steel is $5.1 billion, including $600 million in debt. International Steel makes a variety of hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel as well as wire rod and rail products. Mr. Mittal said the deal signaled ""the creation of a new global powerhouse"" in the steel sector. The new company will have 165,000 employees in 14 countries. Mr. Mittal said it planned to actively participate in further consolidation, by purchasing other producers and buying access to raw materials like coke and coal. Like Mr. Ross, Mr. Mittal, an Indian-born financier, has a pattern of buying undervalued companies. He transformed Ispat from a local, family-run metals business based in Calcutta to a global company by buying up moribund steel assets in Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico and Trinidad and coaxing them into profitability. ""We're both very entrepreneurial groups,"" Mr. Ross explained in a later interview. ""Neither of us understood what we were trying to do was impossible according to the rest of the steel industry, and not knowing it was impossible we went ahead and did it."" The market reacted by pushing shares up for the industry. Ispat shares closed up 27 percent, or $6.96, to $32.30 in New York trading, while International Steel Group rose 19 percent, or $5.57, to $35.25. Other steel companies also gained. AK Steel Holding rose 73 cents, or 8.2 percent, to $9.59. Nucor advanced $1.54, or 3.8 percent, to $41.71. U.S. Steel Corporation jumped $2.24, or 6.7 percent, to $35.85. The deal also comes as prices for many types of steel have more than doubled since early 2003, and demand has increased steadily. International steel consumption in 2004 is expected to reach 918 million tons -- a 5.3 percent increase from a year ago -- according to MEPS International, a consultancy that provides steel prices and production data to the industry. In comparison, finished steel consumption rose an average of 2.5 percent a year in the 10 years to 2002. Analysts said Mr. Ross's deal, while unexpected, looked smart. ""He sold at the right time,"" said Mary O'Connor, an analyst at Locker Associates in New York, a consultancy that does not buy, trade or rate stock. ""This is probably the top of the market."" Still, she added, global demand is unlikely to fall to the lows of 2001 or 2002 anytime in the near term."

The two feel good that their bond has strengthened, that they have seen each other’s tears. They are still waiting to hear an update on Ms. Htwe’s case. Sometimes it feels as if she has been forgotten. The Police Department declined to comment but said it was hoping the public would help find Mr. Robinson. Mr. Shein’s brother Min Liang, the New York police officer, said it is not unusual to have a suspect but no arrest. Mr. Liang, 45, works in evidence collection and has not been involved in Ms. Htwe’s case, but said he trusted the detectives who are handling it. “There’s more than eight million people in New York City,” he said. “They’re not going to find everybody.” The lack of resolution has made Mr. Hein and his father anxious that the same person will hurt someone else, that Ms. Htwe’s death will have changed nothing. They also worry about running into the suspect. Their fear of public places has only amplified. But Mr. Hein has no plans to leave with his father. He has been enamored of America ever since he was a boy and relatives visited Myanmar in Nike sneakers and crisp Nautica shirts. “Even the smell of their laundry detergent was so good,” he remembered. He plans to graduate next spring and has seen for himself the vast difference in the quality of education and job opportunities available in his new home. It is a broken adaptation of the success he had envisioned. Who could have foreseen such sorrow? Perhaps it will be a lonely, hollow existence. But he cannot shake the feeling that a young man like him could still rise here, could still forge a future in which he supports his father from afar and pays tribute to his mother’s hopes.
0~Lawsuits Claim Disney Colluded to Replace U.S. Workers With Immigrants~Even after Leo Perrero was laid off a year ago from his technology job at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. — and spent his final months there training a temporary immigrant from India to do his work — he still hoped to find a new position in the vast entertainment company. But Mr. Perrero discovered that despite his high performance ratings, he and most of the other 250 tech workers Disney dismissed would not be rehired for at least a year, and probably never. Now he and Dena Moore, another American laid off by Disney at that time, have filed lawsuits in federal court in Tampa, Fla., against Disney and two global consulting companies, HCL and Cognizant, which brought in foreign workers who replaced them. They claim the companies colluded to break the law by using temporary H-1B visas to bring in immigrant workers, knowing that Americans would be displaced. “I don’t have to be angry or cause drama,” said Ms. Moore, 53, who had worked at Disney for 10 years. “But they are just doing things to save a buck, and it’s making Americans poor.”
0~What Happened to Europe's Soccer Super League?~Rory Smith noted not only what soccer would lose with the play by the big clubs, but also why fans (and sponsors, and TV broadcasters, and the news media) bore some of the blame for the idea’s coming to fruition. And it is here that those who hope to benefit from shutting the door, from fixing the rules of engagement, cannot take all of the blame. Many of those who spent Sunday spitting fury at the greed of the conspirators have been complicit, over the last 30 years or so, in making this — or something very much like it — the only conclusion possible. That is true of the Premier League, which waved in money from anyone and everyone who could afford to buy a club, which took great pride in its “ownership neutral” approach, which never stopped to ask whether any of it was good for the game. It is true of the Spanish authorities, who made it clear that the rules did not really apply to Real Madrid or Barcelona. It is true, perhaps most of all, of UEFA, which has grown fat and rich on the proceeds of the Champions League, from bowing to the demands of its most powerful constituent clubs, giving more and more power away just to keep the show on the road. It is true, even, of the rest of us in soccer’s thrall — the news media and the commentariat and the fans — who celebrated the multimillion-dollar transfers and the massive television deals and the conspicuous consumption of money and did not stop to ask where it would all go.
0~Advocacy Groups Ask for Ban on Common Pesticide~Advocacy organizations seeking to ban a pesticide linked to developmental disorders in children asked the courts Wednesday to intervene and order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban the pesticide from food within 30 days and from all uses within 60 days if it cannot prove it is safe. The head of the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, last week denied the petition to outlaw chlorpyrifos, a pesticide often used on apples, oranges and other crops, even though the agency’s own safety experts concluded that the chemical should be outlawed. Mr. Pruitt did not present any new evidence that it is safe, and said the agency could not be forced to complete a review of chlorpyrifos until 2022, when there is a deadline for re-evaluating it. The E.P.A. had been under a court order to respond by the end of March to a 10-year-old petition to ban the chemical, originally filed in 2007 by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Pesticide Action Network. The most recent E.P.A. analysis concluded that children were being exposed to up to 140 times the safe levels of the pesticide through food alone. An earlier report said drinking water can also be contaminated.
0~Trump Disavows ‘Send Her Back’ Chant After Pressure From G.O.P.~WASHINGTON — Nervous Republicans, from senior members of Congress to his own daughter Ivanka, urged President Trump on Thursday to repudiate the “send her back” chant directed at a Somali-born congresswoman during his speech the night before at a rally in North Carolina, amid widespread fears that the rally had veered into territory that could hurt their party in 2020. In response, Mr. Trump disavowed the behavior of his own supporters in comments to reporters at the White House and claimed that he had tried to contain it, an assertion clearly contradicted by video of the event. Mr. Trump said he was “not happy” with the chant directed at Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a freshman Democrat who is Muslim. At the rally Wednesday evening, he had been in the middle of denouncing her as an anti-American leftist who has spoken in “vicious, anti-Semitic screeds” when the chant was taken up by the crowd. Pressed on why he did not stop it, Mr. Trump said, “I think I did — I started speaking very quickly.” In fact, as the crowd roared “send her back,” Mr. Trump paused and looked around silently for more than 10 seconds as the scene unfolded in front of him, doing nothing to halt the chorus. “I didn’t say that,” he added. “They did.”
0~Flooding in China kills 21, as thousands escape to shelters.~Flooding caused by torrential rain killed 21 people in China’s Hubei Province, officials said on Thursday, the latest deadly downpour in a summer of extreme weather that has killed hundreds of people across the country’s central region. The heavy rainfall, expected to continue through Friday night, has brought about 20 inches of rain to areas of Hubei since Wednesday, officials said. Four people were missing in addition to the 21 deaths in the township of Liulin, according to local news reports. The flooding caused more than 7,200 people to flee to shelters, while nearly 6,000 more were resettled, local news media reported. More than 280,000 people were affected by the floods, including those who sustained property damage, officials said. The property damage was extensive: In Liulin, more than 2,700 homes and stores were flooded, 63 bridges and about seven miles of roads were destroyed, and 221 buildings collapsed, according to news reports. Videos posted on social media showed rapidly moving floodwaters flowing through streets and overtaking buildings, with cars stuck on destroyed roads.
0~How Sandy Hook Families Achieved Long-Awaited Legal Victories~Years of litigation followed. Remington declared bankruptcy, emerged, then went bankrupt again, threatening to stall the suit indefinitely. The Connecticut Supreme Court affirmed the Sandy Hook lawyers’ strategy and Remington appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. The litigation also took bizarre turns. At one point, Remington requested school report cards and disciplinary records for the murdered children, drawing public outrage. Mr. Koskoff was still exploring legal avenues for the case in the closing days of 2013 when the Connecticut State Police released thousands of photos and records from their investigation of the shooting. When he saw the image of duct-taped magazines lying on the floor, the leg of a small desk chair at the edge of the frame, “the hair on my arms stood up,” he said. “I knew that without a single document I could make the case that there was a connection between the marketing of the gun in the game, this kid and the shooting.” Years later, preparing to depose Remington executives, Mr. Koskoff asked a paralegal to create a PowerPoint slide with the classroom photo on the left, and an image of the taped magazines from Call of Duty on the right. They were nearly identical. Ms. Sterling refined the marketing argument the families took to court. A lawyer for Remington did not respond to requests for comment. The financial settlement will be paid by the defunct company’s four insurers: Liberty Mutual’s Ironshore; Chubb; James River Insurance Company; and North American Capacity Insurance Company, a Swiss Re subsidiary. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry’s trade association, issued a statement last week sidestepping the significance of Bushmaster’s marketing to young men. “The plaintiffs never produced any evidence that Bushmaster advertising had any bearing or influence over Nancy Lanza’s decision to legally purchase a Bushmaster rifle,” it said, “nor on the decision of murderer Adam Lanza to steal that rifle, kill his mother in her sleep and go on to commit the rest of his horrendous crimes.” The Connecticut case could provide a legal road map for similar lawsuits. Ms. Sterling said she had received messages from lawyers across the country.
0~Democrat Warnock Leads Loeffler as Georgia Senate Race Heads to Runoff~The Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, a Democrat, emerged as the leader Tuesday over Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, in a special election to fill a Georgia Senate seat that will now be decided in a January runoff. Fueled by his party’s resurgence in the heart of the Deep South, Dr. Warnock will face Ms. Loeffler in a closely watched one-on-one contest on Jan. 5. Ms. Loeffler, a businesswoman and the Senate’s richest member, was temporarily appointed to fill the seat late last year. With a crowded field of Democrats and Republicans on the Nov. 3 ballot, neither reached the 50 percent threshold required under Georgia law to win outright, according to The Associated Press, but after a nasty intraparty struggle, Ms. Loeffler prevailed over Representative Doug Collins. The runoff between Dr. Warnock and Ms. Loeffler promised to be one of the hardest-fought and most expensive contests in the state’s history. Depending on the outcome of other races, it could determine which party controls the Senate just two weeks before Inauguration Day.
0~Labour Party Suspends Former London Mayor Over Hitler Remarks~LONDON — A dispute over accusations of anti-Semitism within the ranks of Britain’s Labour Party escalated on Thursday as the party suspended Ken Livingstone, a former mayor of London, over remarks suggesting that Hitler had at one point supported Zionism. Mr. Livingstone is an ideological ally of the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who on Wednesday took action against one of his lawmakers, Naseem Shah, in a separate dispute over comments on Facebook about Israel. A well-known personality who has often defended Mr. Corbyn, Mr. Livingstone is not a member of Parliament but leads the international policy commission of Labour’s National Executive Committee, its governing body. His suspension comes as a blow to Mr. Corbyn, who has been accused of failing to root out anti-Semitism within the party. The left wing of the Labour Party, to which both Mr. Corbyn and Mr. Livingstone belong, has long been critical of Israeli policy toward the Palestinians — something its members argue should not be confused with anti-Semitism. The latest dispute occurred in the aftermath of Wednesday’s decision to suspend Ms. Shah, pending an investigation, after it emerged that in 2014, before entering Parliament, she had endorsed a Facebook post displaying a graphic that showed Israel’s outline superimposed on a map of the United States. The map was under the headline, “Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict — relocate Israel into United States,” with the comment, “Problem solved.”
0~Taliban Overrun Seventh and Eighth Afghan Provincial Capitals~KABUL, Afghanistan — Afghan forces essentially collapsed in three more provincial capitals on Tuesday, adding to an already alarming drumbeat of Taliban victories around the country and effectively cutting off the main highway connecting the country’s capital with northern Afghan provinces. The three cities — Pul-i-Khumri, roughly 150 miles north of Kabul in Baghlan Province; Farah, the capital of the western province of the same name; and Faizabad, in remote and rugged Badakhshan Province — were the seventh, eighth and ninth to be overrun by the Taliban in less than a week. There, as in other fallen cities, witnesses and defenders described twinned crises of low morale and exhaustion in the face of unrelenting pressure by the insurgents. The rapid Taliban victories have been a devastating blow to President Ashraf Ghani’s government, and to the military and police forces that the United States and its Western allies spent years and billions of dollars training to stand against the Taliban. And the losses are coming just three weeks before American troops are to complete their final withdrawal from the country, leaving a modest force behind to defend the U.S. Embassy. The question of whether the Afghan forces can even successfully defend Kabul, the national capital, has become an urgent one, with heavy fighting now going on in or around every one of the country’s other most populous cities.

0~Stymied in Seeking Benefits, Millions of Unemployed Go Uncounted~Some applications are missing information. New York analyzed a million claims and found many had been delayed because of a missing employer identification number. In such cases, each applicant has to be called back. Callers looking for updates also flood the system, increasing the wait for those who need to correct a mistake. Inflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. The seasonally adjusted number of people filing initial unemployment claims is down from late March and early April, when more than six million people applied for benefits two weeks in a row. But that’s a small consolation in light of the larger economic picture, economists said. Before the pandemic, just over 200,000 people a week applied for new unemployment benefits. “It is declining, but the level is still breathtakingly high,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Claims could stay in the millions for several more weeks, which is almost unfathomable.” Mr. Shepherdson said job cuts now extended far beyond the industries initially hit by the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown in most states, like leisure and hospitality. “You can’t close a bar twice,” he said. “Layoffs are now working their way through management and supply chains and business services.” Millions who have managed to keep their jobs face salary cuts or furloughs, a sign of employers’ uncertainty. Given the trillions spent, “we would have hoped that federal efforts would have been more effective at stemming job losses,” said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. Mr. Gapen said he expected the unemployment rate to hit 19.5 percent in April, a level unseen since the Depression.
0~Banksy’s ‘Dismaland’ in England: It’s a Strange World, After All~Lines into “Dismaland” on Saturday and Sunday started several hours before the park’s 11 a.m. opening, but by early afternoon the line appeared to be only several hundred people long and to be moving quickly. Shortly after the website for “Dismaland” went up on Thursday, the ticketing function abruptly crashed, prompting online speculation that the ticketing issues were part of Banksy’s doom-and-gloom concept. In an email, Clare Croome, a spokeswoman for Banksy, said there was “no truth” to the Internet rumors, and that the site had crashed after receiving 6 million hits per minute. (Tickets are still available at the entrance, and online ticketing is expected to resume this week.) The exhibition was out of the ordinary for Banksy, who is mostly known for graffiti works that pop up in unexpected urban locales. His last major display was a series of political murals that he unveiled in Gaza in February. In 2009, he staged an exhibition featuring dozens of his own artworks at the Bristol City Museum. That show was also kept tightly under wraps before it opened, even from many staff members at the museum. In 2013, he had a major outdoor exhibition in New York.
0~New York’s Leadership Is Mostly White. That’s Roiling the Speaker’s Race.~Rarely is the question asked: Is New York ready for a white male political leader? But with a white man re-elected as mayor (Bill de Blasio), a white man as governor (Andrew M. Cuomo), a white man as attorney general (Eric T. Schneiderman), and white men as city and state comptroller (Scott M. Stringer and Thomas P. DiNapoli), race has emerged as a flash point in the elbows-out battle to lead the City Council for the next four years. The speakership contest, for arguably the second most powerful elected post in city government, has raged behind the scenes for months, with eight men competing to replace the current speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito. Early conventional wisdom congealed over the summer that two councilmen from Manhattan, Corey Johnson and Mark Levine, had emerged as the front-runners. Both are white — prompting a backlash among some influential black and Latino city leaders. “New York advertises one thing. When you buy the product, you’re buying a rainbow,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the longtime African-American activist. “And when you get home you find out you have a white, vanilla ice cream cone and there is no rainbow inside.” Mr. Sharpton called the lack of diversity among the elected leaders in a majority-minority city “a glaring example of the hypocrisy of liberal New York,” and deemed it an issue in the speaker’s race.
0~CDC Panel Says Frontline Workers and People Over 74 Should Get Vaccine Next~Striking a compromise between two high-risk population groups, a panel advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Sunday to recommend that people age 75 and older be next in line to receive the coronavirus vaccine in the United States, along with about 30 million “frontline essential workers,” such as emergency responders, teachers and grocery store employees. The debate about who should receive the vaccine in these early months has grown increasingly urgent as the daily tally of cases has swelled to numbers unimaginable to the general public even weeks ago. The country has already begun vaccinating health care workers, and on Monday, CVS and Walgreens are to begin a mass inoculation campaign at the nation’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities. This week roughly six million doses of the newly authorized Moderna vaccine are to start arriving at more than 3,700 locations around the country, including many smaller and rural hospitals, widening the rollout that began with Pfizer’s vaccine last week. The panel of doctors and public health experts had previously indicated it would recommend a much broader group of Americans defined as essential workers — about 90 million people with jobs designated by a division of the Department of Homeland Security as critical to keeping society functioning — as the next priority population, and that older people who live independently should come later. But in hours of discussion on Sunday, conducted remotely, the committee members concluded that given the limited initial supply of vaccine and the higher Covid-19 death rate among older Americans, it made more sense to allow the oldest among them to go next, along with workers whose jobs put them “at substantially higher risk of exposure” to the virus.
0~M.I.T. Media Lab, Already Rattled by the Epstein Scandal, Has a New Worry~The former OpenAg researchers said that the food computers did not work as well as Mr. Harper said they did, adding that he often presented speculative claims as scientific truths while raising funds. In a recent interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education, Mr. Harper defended himself against that accusation, saying that he had not misled anyone and that his statements about the project were meant to describe his vision for its future. Babak Babakinejad, a Ph.D. who was formerly the project’s lead researcher, detailed his concerns about how OpenAg was presented in an email to Mr. Harper. He said he had sent the email, which he shared with The Times, after his contract with OpenAg was not renewed. “You seem to think endlessly reiterating untrue claims will lend them credibility, but it won’t,” Dr. Babakinejad wrote to Mr. Harper. “By persisting in this course of action, you have been putting M.I.T. and everyone associated with you at risk and I think it’s time that you were made to face up to that and take responsibility for it.” The four former researchers said that those who worked on the project were often told to make the food computers appear to work better than they did during promotional photo shoots or visits from the lab’s sponsors or the news media. Paula Cerqueira, a former special projects manager at OpenAg, said she had been told to buy a lavender plant from a store near the OpenAg facility before photos were taken. She brushed dirt off the plant, she said, and placed it inside a food computer before the shoot. What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information?

0~Trump’s New Intelligence Director Faces a Legal Countdown Clock on His Tenure~WASHINGTON — President Trump’s new acting director of national intelligence may hold the job for only about three weeks — unless the White House quickly finds a permanent nominee to offer to the Senate for confirmation. The president tapped Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany, on Wednesday to add the role overseeing the nation’s 17 spy agencies to his existing duties. Mr. Grenell agreed to hold the post for only a limited period of time, according to people familiar with his plan. Federal law gives the president a great deal of flexibility to appoint whomever he chooses to the position on a temporary basis while his official nominee for the job awaits confirmation from the Senate. Late Thursday, Mr. Trump, traveling on the West Coast, told reporters he was considering naming Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia and an ally of his currently running for the Senate, as the permanent director. Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr. Grenell can serve in his post only until March 11 unless the president formally nominates someone else for the job. That move would allow Mr. Grenell to serve for months longer as the nomination works its way through the Senate. Two administration officials said that officials were aware that they must nominate someone else soon, and that the process to find a formal nominee was underway.
0~New Higher Education Bill Rolls Back Obama-Era Safeguards~WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans began work Tuesday on an extensive rewrite of the law that governs the nation’s system of higher education, seeking to dismantle landmark Obama administration regulations designed to protect students from predatory for-profit colleges and to repay the loans of those who earned worthless degrees from scam universities. But in its systematic effort to erase President Barack Obama’s fingerprints from higher education, the measure before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce could undermine bedrock elements that have guided university education for decades. One provision could do away with the system of “credit hours” that college students earn to complete their degrees, which could help for-profit colleges inflate the value of their degrees. The bill “addresses many of the ill-conceived mandates handed down by the Obama administration in favor of policies that will allow higher education to meet the current needs of students,” said Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the committee chairwoman and the chief author of the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity Through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act. Many elements of the bill pursue bipartisan goals: simplifying the federal financial aid process, cutting down on student debt and expanding programs like federal work-study programs.
0~Iraqi Forces Enter Falluja, Encountering Little Fight From ISIS~BAGHDAD — Iraqi forces quickly entered central areas of Falluja on Friday after weeks of battling the Islamic State, fighting that had forced thousands of civilians to flee and overwhelmed the ability of aid agencies to care for them. Reporting little resistance from Islamic State fighters, counterterrorism forces raised the Iraqi flag over the main government building in central Falluja, officers and state television reports said. They said that pro-government forces moved on to besiege the city’s main hospital, which was the first target of American forces when they invaded the city in 2004 and in recent months has served as a headquarters complex for the Islamic State. The rapid and unexpected gains suggested a shift in tactics by the Sunni extremists of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, or perhaps a sign of their weakness, as they abandoned their dug-in positions and regrouped in western neighborhoods of Falluja. That allowed thousands of civilians, who aid groups had said were being held as human shields, to flee across two bridges over the Euphrates River beginning on Thursday.

0~Meningitis Cases Are Linked to Steroid Injections~Had he done anything unusual in the weeks before he became ill? she asked. The answer alarmed her. He had had a steroid injection in his spinal area to relieve back pain — a common treatment, administered to millions of people in the United States every year. Dr. Pettit called the State Health Department. She is now credited with being the clinician who recognized the “index case” in what has become a frightening outbreak of meningitis that has killed two people and sickened 12 others who also received steroid injections in their spines for pain. Doctors suspect that the steroid medicine was contaminated with the fungus. The meningitis does not spread from person to person. Officials said it was not possible to predict the extent of the outbreak yet. Thirteen of the patients have been in Tennessee, and one in North Carolina. Two of the cases were new as of Tuesday, and health officials have said that there could be more cases and that other states could be affected. “I don’t think we’ve identified all the cases that will be identified,” said Dr. David Reagan, the chief medical officer for the Tennessee Health Department. Dr. Pettit’s patient was one of the two who died. The Tennessee patients were treated at the Saint Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center in Nashville, which was closed on Sept. 20. Center staff members notified more than 700 patients who received injections of the suspect drug. Another Tennessee clinic, the Specialty Surgery Center in Crossville, also received shipments of the possibly contaminated drug and was notifying patients.
0~Russia’s War Lacks a Battlefield Commander, U.S. Officials Say~WASHINGTON — Russia is running its military campaign against Ukraine out of Moscow, with no central war commander on the ground to call the shots, according to American officials who have studied the five-week-old war. That approach may go a long way to explain why the Russian war effort has struggled in the face of stiffer-than-expected Ukrainian resistance, the officials said. The lack of a unifying military leader in Ukraine has meant that Russian air, ground and sea units are not in sync. Their disjointed battlefield campaigns have been plagued by poor logistics, flagging morale and between 7,000 and 15,000 military deaths, senior U.S. officials and independent analysts say. It has also contributed to the deaths of at least seven Russian generals as high-ranking officers are pushed to the front lines to untangle tactical problems that Western militaries would leave to more junior officers or senior enlisted personnel.
0~CITY STEETS THROUGH GRIDLOCK ALERT~SUZANNE DALEY At the command center - a brown van parked at 49th Street and Rockefeller Center - three city traffic agents listened to radios, keeping a ledger of the reports coming in. ''There's a tractor-trailer blocking two lanes at 39th and 10th Avenue,'' an agent at the scene called in. ''He says he has the Commissioner's permission.'' In the back seat of the van, beside a map of midtown Manhattan titled ''Gridlock Alert Day,'' the head of the Bureau of Traffic Operations, Samuel I. Schwartz, looked up from his clipboard. ''No, he doesn't,'' he said. ''That is a negative,'' the traffic agent manning the radio answered. ''You are to move that vehicle. Copy?'' One of the Worst Days
0~Tim Burton’s ‘Alice’: Oh, What a Wonderful, but Different, World~INSTEAD of Wonderland, it’s Underland. Instead of Alice as a bored but clever child, we get Alice as a 19-year-old rebel and warrior, dispatching the monstrous Jabberwocky with a magic sword. Disney’s second rendering of Lewis Carroll’s fantasy, in other words, is a world apart from both its 1951 cartoon version and the original Victorian-era text. Directed by Tim Burton, “Alice in Wonderland,” a 3-D blend of live action and animation that opens Friday, is meant as a contemporary, subversive take on a cherished story. With the 20-year-old Australian actress Mia Wasikowska, who had a breakout role in the first season of HBO’s “In Treatment,” as Alice, it begins with an unwanted marriage proposal before veering off into Underland, where Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen await. Since “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” and its sequel, “Through the Looking-Glass,” were first published nearly 150 years ago, Alice’s tale has been retold in many versions and many media, including as a musical, anime, video game and more than a score of film and television adaptations. But for Mr. Burton the very abundance and familiarity of the material “in the subconscious and in the culture” was an incentive  not a deterrent  to take it on. “I’ve seen mostly everything, but there’s never been a version for me that particularly works, that I especially like or that blows me away,” he said this month in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. “It always ends up seeming like a clueless little girl wandering around with a bunch of weirdos. And the fact that there was no one definitive version was helpful. It’s not like the Disney cartoon was the greatest. So I didn’t feel that pressure to match or surpass.”
0~Pompeo backs Trump’s actions to contest election results, and Biden calls them ‘an embarrassment.’~"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday predicted “a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” defending President Trump’s refusal to concede the election even as President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. called Mr. Trump’s actions since Election Day “an embarrassment.” Speaking to reporters in Delaware, Mr. Biden shrugged off Mr. Pompeo’s comments, saying that his transition was moving along well and that he is confident that Republicans will eventually accept his victory. “They will. They will,” he said. Asked about Mr. Trump’s ongoing refusal to concede the election and his vow to continue litigating the outcome in court, Mr. Biden said: “How can I say this tactfully? It will not help the president’s legacy."" Mr. Pompeo made his remarks about the next administration in a deadpan voice, followed by a chuckle and a grin. It was not clear if he was joking and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarity. Mr. Biden did not specifically react to Mr. Pompeo’s assertion that he believes there will be a second Trump term."
0~Rain Showers in Greenland Point to Climate Change~Something extraordinary happened last Saturday at the frigid high point of the Greenland ice sheet, two miles in the sky and more than 500 miles above the Arctic Circle: It rained for the first time. The rain at a research station — not just a few drops or a drizzle but a stream for several hours, as temperatures rose slightly above freezing — is yet another troubling sign of a changing Arctic, which is warming faster than any other region on the planet. “It’s incredible, because it does write a new chapter in the book of Greenland,” said Marco Tedesco, a researcher at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. “This is really new.” At the station, which is called Summit and is occupied year-round under the auspices of the National Science Foundation, there is no record of rain since observations began in the 1980s. And computer simulations show no evidence going back even further, said Thomas Mote, a climate scientist at the University of Georgia.
0~Virus Forces Persian Gulf States to Reckon With Migrant Labor~BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Kuwaiti talk show panelists were holding forth on an issue that the coronavirus has pushed to the forefront of national debate: whether their tiny, oil-rich monarchy should rely as heavily as it does on foreign laborers, who have suffered most of the country’s infections and borne much of the cost of its lockdown. “Go to malls in Kuwait — would you ever see a Kuwaiti working there?” said one guest, Ahmad Baqer. “No. They’re all different nationalities.” Not long after, a South Asian man slipped into the camera frame, serving tea to each panelist from a tray. He appeared three times during the program, his presence unacknowledged except by one panelist who waved away a fresh cup. In the Middle East’s wealthiest societies, the machinery of daily life depends on migrant laborers from Asia, Africa and poorer Arab countries — millions of “tea boys,” housemaids, doctors, construction workers, deliverymen, chefs, garbagemen, guards, hairdressers, hoteliers and more, who often outnumber the native population.
0~The New York Times~Day’s later career choices reflected a skepticism of new mores. As Clarke remarks: “The widespread use of and public respectability for ‘the Pill’ by the late ’60s put a new pressure on women. Far from ‘sexual freedom’ the Pill was a gun placed at any woman’s head: as if the threat of pregnancy was the only reason a woman might have wished to say no to sex.” Day evinced “distaste for the new ‘permissiveness,’ which she perceptively saw to be oppressive rather than liberating.” Her pictures feature meat diets, carriage rides, careers in the cattle industry; they depict chicken-truck accidents as hilarious. In “Do Not Disturb,” she saves a fox but sports a fur. Day is an inexhaustible animal advocate today, but these plotlines dismay because, as Tom Santopietro notes in “Considering Doris Day,” “she functioned as a role model through whom thousands of women worldwide lived vicariously.” Day herself has mentioned projects she refused or changes she insisted on: she declined the role of Mrs. Robinson in “The Graduate” (finding it exploitative) and had vulgarities removed from “Lover Come Back.” She demanded proper care and feeding of the animals involved in the Alfred Hitchcock film “The Man Who Knew Too Much,” which was shot partly in Morocco. What Day refuses to tolerate is relevant because while her performances were a product of their era, sales of her albums seem to double or triple with each passing year, and DVDs of her movies are increasingly popular. She may not have pursued a political image, but her effect is more intimate, and more powerful, than that of many politicians. A testament to this power is that the organizations founded in her name have attracted more than 180,000 members, continuing to draw attention to the issue of animal rights, which has been called the most progressive cause of our time. In 1977, she founded the Doris Day Pet Foundation (now the Doris Day Animal Foundation), and 10 years later the Doris Day Animal League, which focuses on lobbying Washington for pro-animal legislation, like bills ending the slaughter of horses for human consumption and creating a federal entity to review and approve alternatives to animal testing. The Animal League has also initiated a program called the Vicious Circle, which explores the connection between violence against animals and violence against people. (Santopietro repeatedly refers to Day as an “animal lover,” a common misnomer. One doesn’t have to love animals to respect them. “Animal lover” can’t help carrying a note of condescension, often used by those wishing to dismiss the larger issues at stake; it is similar to calling a white person who fights for civil rights a “Negro lover.” Day cares for her companion animals, but what she has achieved through her organizations and lifestyle goes beyond affection: she’s pursuing a change in the mind-set that allows human beings to treat other species as objects.) In 2006, the Animal League joined forces with the Humane Society of the United States, the largest animal protection organization in America. Day’s personal life is best covered in her autobiography; perhaps realizing this, Santopietro concentrates on her multifaceted career. He is sympathetic to women and knowledgeable about his subject, and his respect for her is refreshing — he obviously enjoys her work and refrains from sensationalism. Less astute are his positive comments about the “period dress” in “Love Me or Leave Me” (historical accuracy not being a Hollywood strength); overuse of phrases like “right on the money” and “first-rate”; and comparisons with Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand. (He is also the author of “The Importance of Being Barbra.”) Still, “Considering Doris Day” includes a comprehensive filmography, a selected discography and many photographs, and covers ground less traveled by traditional biographies. It’s an easy read, at times illuminating — as when Santopietro discusses the “three-stage cycle” of “mass popularity, widespread derision and, years later, a nostalgic embrace of fondly recalled cultural touchstones that evolves into a cultural reassessment.”
0~For Some Atlanta Hawks, a Revved-Up Game of Uno Is Diversion No. 1~PHILADELPHIA — Lamar Patterson was new to the Atlanta Hawks when he discovered several teammates playing a popular card game at training camp. Patterson asked if he could join them. He thought he knew the rules. “I’m sitting down with these guys for the first time, and I play all the time, you know what I’m saying?” Patterson, a reserve shooting guard, said before a recent game here. “But they were all like, ‘No, see, we play this way, with the Draw 2s and the Draw 4s from the extra decks. We lay the heat.’ And I was like, ‘Wow.’ ” The Hawks were laying the heat — playing Uno, the colorful card game favored by countless schoolchildren and, yes, by a group of millionaires aboard the Hawks’ private plane. “Uno,” forward Kent Bazemore said, “is always a thrill.” The Hawks, like many professional sports teams, have a lot of free time to kill, much of it spent on airplanes. Some of the players keep busy by watching movies. Many sleep. Others play cards, a popular pastime for athletes who are competitive by nature.
0~Children Hurt Women’s Earnings, but Not Men’s (Even in Scandinavia)~But policy alone would not be enough to overcome gender inequality. It would require changes in behavior — including by men. There is evidence that the gap would shrink if fathers acted more the way mothers do after having children, by spending more time on parenting and the related responsibilities. “At the very least, men have to take a larger role,” said Francine Blau, an economist at Cornell who has studied the gender pay gap and family-friendly policies in the United States and Europe. “It does become a distinction in the eyes of employers between potential male and female workers, and it may reinforce traditional gender roles.” One new study, which used a data set including everyone in Denmark from 1980 to 2013, along with details about their jobs and families, found that while there was a pay gap before people had children, it was relatively small and earnings were increasing at similar rates. But after the first child, women’s gross earnings quickly dropped 30 percent, and never fully recovered. In the long term, mothers earned 20 percent less. Women who did not have children continued to increase their earnings at a rate similar to men. Most studies of the pay gap analyze equal pay for equal work. But in this paper, researchers examined how women changed their work in response to having children, and how that affected their lifelong pay. Mothers were paid less partly because they worked fewer hours, took longer breaks from employment and were more likely to move into lower-paying, family-friendly jobs, the paper found. Their probability of becoming a manager also declined. “Equal work is in practice not an option for most women, because they have to take care of the children and therefore have different kinds of jobs and different kinds of hours,” said Henrik Kleven, an economist at Princeton, who wrote the paper with Jakob Egholt Sogaard, an economist at the University of Copenhagen, and Camille Landais, an economist at the London School of Economics. As in the United States, the pay gap in Denmark has shrunk over time as women have become better educated than men and more likely to be professionals or managers. Children, which accounted for 40 percent of the pay gap in 1980, now account for 80 percent of it. Discrimination and other factors play a role in the remaining gap, researchers say. The same pattern is true elsewhere. In the United States, a study by Census Bureau researchers found that between two years before the birth of a couple’s first child and a year after, the earnings gap between opposite-sex spouses doubles. The gap continues to grow for the next five years.

0~Wyoming Vaccine Mandate Could Stretch Hospital Staffing, Officials Say~The coronavirus is raging in the northern states of the Mountain West, especially Wyoming, where the Delta variant is tearing through one of the least vaccinated areas in the country. Wyoming is tied with its neighbor Idaho for the second-lowest vaccination rate of any U.S. state. Each has fully vaccinated 41 percent of residents, compared with 56 percent nationally. And newly reported virus cases are at their highest levels since November in Wyoming and neighboring Montana. Covid-19 patients are filling Wyoming’s hospitals and stretching health care workers thin, leading to the cancellation of elective procedures at some hospitals. Some patients are traveling as far away as Texas for care. Unlike hospitals in many states, most in Wyoming are not requiring their employees to be vaccinated. Some hospital administrators worry that President Biden’s national vaccine mandate for health care workers, which has yet to take effect, could prompt some workers to quit, making staffing shortages more severe.
0~Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Apologizes for Vote on Iron Dome Funding~WASHINGTON — Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and the highest-profile progressive in the House, apologized on Friday to her constituents for an abrupt decision to pull back her vote against providing $1 billion in new funding for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, suggesting she had done so after being subjected to “hateful targeting” for opposing it. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the liberal group known as the Squad, was one of two members who voted “present” as the measure to help Israel replace missile interceptors overwhelmingly passed the House on Thursday on a vote of 420 to 9. She was seen weeping on the House floor after she switched her vote from “no” to “present.” The episode captured the bitter divide among Democrats over Israel, which has pit a small but vocal group of progressives who have called for an end to conditions-free aid to the country against the vast majority of the party, which maintains that the United States must not waver in its backing for Israel’s right to defend itself. In a lengthy letter on Friday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told her constituents that she opposed the funding, citing “persistent human rights abuses against the Palestinian people,” and had pleaded with top Democrats to delay the vote.
0~Plan to Honor Big Developer in Brooklyn Is Criticized~The Municipal Art Society is well known for campaigns to save Grand Central Terminal and Lever House and to stop towers that would have cast long shadows over Central Park. But now the civic organization is the one defending itself, for deciding to award the developer Bruce C. Ratner its highest honor, one named for the very person who led some of those fights. Next week, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Medal — a recognition of “individuals who, by their work and deeds, have made an outstanding contribution to New York City” — is to be given to Mr. Ratner and his successor as chief executive of Forest City Ratner, MaryAnne Gilmartin. Their contributions are such skyline-defining and neighborhood-altering projects as the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, a downtown apartment tower by Frank Gehry and the headquarters of The New York Times.
0~Why You Should Feel Free to Ignore Polls for a Few Weeks~Donald Trump officially became the Republican party’s nominee Thursday night, and on Monday, the Democratic convention begins in Philadelphia. In the coming weeks, you can expect lots of polls — and headlines — suggesting new insight into the state of the presidential race. With some caveats, our advice is: Don’t pay too much attention to them. You can see what we mean in the chart above. It shows how much the polling average at each point of a presidential election cycle has differed from the final result. Each gray line represents a presidential election since 1980; the bright green line represents the average difference. In general, as the election nears, the polling average comes closer and closer to the election’s final result — but not for the next few weeks. History suggests that in the short periods after the conventions, the polling average can often move away from the final result, not toward it. That’s because polls taken in the middle of the convention are often unreliable: Gains made by the party’s nominee can often be short-lived.
0~Museums Cut Ties With Sacklers as Outrage Over Opioid Crisis Grows~In London this weekend, visitors to the Old Royal Naval College headed to its reopened “painted hall,” an ornate masterpiece called Britain’s answer to the Sistine Chapel, and then went to the Sackler Gallery to learn its story. In Paris, at the Louvre, lovers of Persian art knew there was only one place to go: the Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities. Want to find the long line for the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Head for the soaring, glass-walled Sackler Wing. For decades, the Sackler family has generously supported museums worldwide, not to mention numerous medical and educational institutions including Columbia University, where there is a Sackler Institute, and Oxford, where there is a Sackler Library. But now some favorite Sackler charities are reconsidering whether they want the money at all, and several have already rejected any future gifts, concluding that some family members’ ties to the opioid crisis outweighed the benefits of their six- and sometimes seven-figure checks.
0~Mixed Results on Paying City Students to Pass Tests~Offered up to $1,000 for scoring well on Advanced Placement exams, students at 31 New York City high schools took 345 more of the tests this year than last. But the number who passed declined slightly, raising questions about the effectiveness of increasingly popular pay-for-performance programs in schools here and across the country. Students involved in the program, financed with $2 million in private donations and aimed at closing a racial gap in Advanced Placement results, posted more 5’s, the highest possible score. That rise, however, was overshadowed by a decline in the number of 4’s and 3’s. Three is the minimum passing score. The effort to reward city students for passing Advanced Placement tests is part of a growing trend nationally and internationally, and one of several new programs in New York, to experiment with using financial incentives to lift attendance and achievement. The results, scheduled to be formally announced on Wednesday, are likely to be closely examined by both enthusiasts who herald such programs as groundbreaking innovation and detractors who deride them as short-sighted bribes that threaten broader educational progress.
0~Manchester City Appeal Rejected at CAS~MONTREUX, Switzerland — An attempt by Manchester City to block an investigation into its finances and spending was rejected Friday by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled that the club’s appeal was “inadmissible” because European soccer officials have not yet issued a ruling in the case. Investigators from UEFA, the sport’s governing body in Europe, have spent months looking into possible violations of the organization’s so-called financial fair play rules. Those rules, in place since 2011, were devised to impose a measure of financial fairness within the European soccer economy by linking spending to revenues, but powerful clubs have routinely avoided serious punishment for breaking them. Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champion, had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in June, about a month after The New York Times reported that UEFA investigators were seeking at least a one-season ban of the club from the Champions League, European’s soccer biggest and richest club competition. City has contended that UEFA acted incorrectly in assigning its case to the governing body’s financial crimes unit. CAS officials stressed that Friday’s decision was not a verdict on any of the underlying accusations against Manchester City.
0~Covid-19: F.D.A. Clears Pfizer Vaccine and Millions of Doses Will Be Shipped Right Away~Image Freezer units at a United Parcel Service center await shipments of Covid-19 vaccines. Credit... UPS/EPA, via Shutterstock The Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday, clearing the way for millions of highly vulnerable people to begin receiving the vaccine within days. The authorization is a historic turning point in a pandemic that has taken more than 290,000 lives in the United States. With the decision, the United States becomes the sixth country — in addition to Britain, Bahrain, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico — to clear the vaccine. Other authorizations, including by the European Union, are expected within weeks. The F.D.A.’s decision followed an extraordinary sequence of events on Friday morning when the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, to consider looking for his next job if he didn’t get the emergency approval done on Friday, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. Dr. Hahn then ordered vaccine regulators at the agency to do it by the end of the day. The authorization set off a complicated coordination effort from Pfizer, private shipping companies, state and local health officials, the military, hospitals and pharmacy chains to get the first week’s batch of about three million doses to health care workers and nursing home residents as quickly as possible, all while keeping the vaccine at ultracold temperatures. Pfizer has a deal with the U.S. government to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine by next March. Under that agreement, the shots will be free to the public. Every state, along with six major cities, has submitted to the federal government a list of locations — mostly hospitals — where the Pfizer vaccine is to ship initially. In populous Florida, the first recipients will be five hospitals, in Jacksonville, Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Hollywood. In tiny, rural Vermont, only the University of Vermont Medical Center and a state warehouse will get supplies. McKesson Corporation, a giant medical supplier, is sending kits of syringes, alcohol pads, face shields and other supplies to the same sites, where they will meet up with the vaccines that Pfizer is shipping in special boxes, packed with dry ice, designed to keep them at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit. The Pfizer packaging will include a device that tracks the location of the box, plus a thermal probe that will make sure the deep freeze is maintained throughout the journey from the company’s distribution sites in Michigan and Wisconsin. The decision is a victory for Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, which began working on the vaccine 11 months ago. Vaccines typically take years to develop. The companies’ late-stage clinical trial, which enrolled nearly 44,000 people, was found to be 95 percent effective. The vaccine will be scarce at first. Pfizer had to scale back earlier estimates because of manufacturing setbacks, and has said it will be able to supply up to 25 million doses before the end of the year, and 100 million total vaccines by March. Federal officials are initially holding back half of the supply so that they can give a booster shot to recipients three weeks after their first vaccination. Even though only about three million people will receive a vaccine in the first week, officials have held firm on their estimate that, between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which each require two shots, they hope to give at least 20 million people their first dose of a vaccine by the end of the year. An expert panel advising the F.D.A. on Thursday gave its approval of Pfizer’s vaccine for people 16 and older, and the agency was planning to release the formal authorization on Saturday. That timeline was accelerated by half a day after President Trump attacked Dr. Hahn for failing to authorize a vaccine more quickly. But the accelerated announcement was not expected to speed up the delivery of vaccines around the country.
0~Hey Boss, You Don’t Want Your Employees to Meditate~Mindfulness meditation, a Buddhism-inspired practice in which you focus your mind entirely on the current moment, has been widely embraced for its instrumental benefits — especially in the business world. Companies like Apple, Google and Nike provide meditation rooms that encourage brief sessions during the workday. Chief executives publicly extol its benefits. And no wonder: The practical payoff of mindfulness is backed by dozens of studies linking it to job satisfaction, rational thinking and emotional resilience. But on the face of it, mindfulness might seem counterproductive in a workplace setting. A central technique of mindfulness meditation, after all, is to accept things as they are. Yet companies want their employees to be motivated. And the very notion of motivation — striving to obtain a more desirable future — implies some degree of discontentment with the present, which seems at odds with a psychological exercise that instills equanimity and a sense of calm. To test this hunch, we recently conducted five studies, involving hundreds of people, to see whether there was a tension between mindfulness and motivation. As we report in a forthcoming article in the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, we found strong evidence that meditation is demotivating. Some of the participants in our studies were trained in a few of the most common mindfulness meditation techniques. They were instructed by a professional meditation coach to focus on their breathing or mentally scan their bodies for physical sensations, being gently reminded throughout that there was no right or wrong way to do the exercise.
0~Facebook Starts Paying a Price for Scandals~SAN FRANCISCO — For nearly two years, Facebook has appeared bulletproof despite a series of scandals about the misuse of its giant social network. But the Silicon Valley company’s streak ended on Wednesday when it said that the accumulation of issues was starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business — and that the costs are set to continue playing out for months. Facebook reported on Wednesday that growth in digital advertising sales and in the number of its users had decelerated in the second quarter. The company’s leaders, including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, added that the trajectory was not likely to improve anytime soon, especially as Facebook spends to improve the privacy and security of users. Facebook has grappled with months of scrutiny over Russian misuse of the platform in the 2016 American presidential campaign and the harvesting of its users’ data through the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The results were among the first signs that the issues had pierced the company’s image and would have a lasting effect on its moneymaking machine.
0~Wisconsin Republicans’ Election Report Endorses Debunked Legal Theories~A Republican report on the 2020 election in Wisconsin endorsed a host of debunked claims of fraud and false assertions about lawmakers’ power to decertify President Biden’s victory, lending credence to the conspiracy theories that have gripped Republicans in the state for more than 16 months. The claims in the report, commissioned by the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly and written by a conservative former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, immediately reopened a rift among Republicans in one of the nation’s most narrowly divided battleground states. While some in the party are trying to move on to the next election, the report is likely to fuel those still fixated on overturning the last one. The document is the latest, but not the final, word on Wisconsin’s ongoing Republican-authorized investigation into false claims of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election. Robin Vos, the Wisconsin Assembly speaker, commissioned the investigation and appointed Michael J. Gableman, the former justice, to lead it in June, days after former President Donald J. Trump issued statements criticizing him and other leading Wisconsin Republicans for “working hard to cover up election corruption.” Mr. Gableman presented his findings to the Wisconsin Assembly’s elections committee during a hearing Tuesday. He directly contradicted a legal analysis conducted by the Legislature’s lawyers in November that found there is no basis in law for decertifying an election.
0~How Rare Earths (What?) Could Be Crucial in a U.S.-China Trade War~On a recent visit, Lynas technicians mixed rare earth concentrate, which looks to the untrained eye like unremarkable dirt, into chemical tanks that extract elements like lanthanum and cerium. Through a series of steps that take place in more than a dozen buildings, the resulting pinkish powder was funneled through oversize sieves into boxes on a conveyor belt and baked at 1,000 degrees Celsius. “It’s just like a giant pizza oven,” Ms. Lacaze said. Next door to the oven, more than 150 bags of neodymium and praseodymium and cerium sat on a warehouse floor to be shipped to customers around the world. These bags are precious goods — each one filled with neodymium and praseodymium is worth around $50,000. “Just don’t hit the bag!” Ms. Lacaze said she likes to tell the forklift operators. “It’s like hitting a BMW.” Ms. Lacaze, 58, was an experienced turnaround specialist who had worked in telecommunications and consumer products in Australia before coming to Lynas. In a drawl that hints at her Brisbane roots, she said she knew well the “glass cliff” phenomenon, in which organizations in crisis are more likely than successful businesses to offer leadership positions to women. “Women more often get to do jobs like mine, where you clean up other people’s mistakes,” said Ms. Lacaze, wearing her signature pink work boots. She is one of fewer than a dozen women running the 200 biggest companies in Australia, where Lynas is publicly listed. She has looked to elevate women at Lynas, often out of necessity as well as virtue. Unable to expand payroll during the the slump, Ms. Lacaze turned to current employees — often women — who worked in support roles like human resources and finance and shifted them to the factory floor to be operators, technicians and shift supervisors.
0~Death Toll in Oakland Warehouse Fire Rises to 36 as Search Continues~OAKLAND, Calif. — Carmen Brito was asleep on Friday night when she suddenly woke up gasping for breath. Outside her small studio, one floor down from where a raging concert was taking place, she saw her neighbor’s wall on fire. “I’m pretty sure I was the first person to see the fire, and when I saw it, it was bigger than I was,” said Ms. Brito, 28. The inferno killed at least 36 people and is regarded as one of the worst structure fires in the United States in over a decade. On Sunday, firefighters were digging through the ruins of the warehouse, where people had gathered for an electronic dance show on Friday when flames ripped through the building, collapsing the floors. The search of the building, which had only two exits, could continue for days, officials said at a news conference, warning that the death toll could climb considerably higher.
0~Questions deepen in Russia, days after the sinking of a warship.~While carefully scripted television news programs still use the “military operation” formula, guests in the heat of the shouting that is a trademark of Russian TV talk shows often yell about “war.” The even angrier tone than usual when discussing the sinking of the Moskva indicated that many commentators found Ukraine culpable. Skipping the official explanation that it caught fire, for example, Vladimir Bortko, a film director and former member of the Duma, Russia’s parliament, said on Thursday that the assault on the vessel should be treated as an assault on Russia itself. “The special military operation has ended, it ended last night when our motherland was attacked,” he said, after asking the other panelists to remind him what Russia was calling the war. “The attack on our territory is casus belli, an absolute cause for war for real.” He suggested that possible responses included bombing Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv; the transportation networks that allowed foreign dignitaries to visit; or something more sinister: “Bomb them once and that is it.” His ranting about war brought an admonition from Olga Skabaeeva, the host of the popular “60 Minutes” program, who said that he was talking in the context of NATO aggression against Russia. Some analysts think all the talk of NATO attacking Russia is meant to lay the groundwork for a possible general mobilization of the male population — martial law is a necessary prior step, and a declaration of martial law requires going to war or being under threat. Until now, however, Russian news programs are not calling the events in Ukraine a war. They take their cues from the Ministry of Defense’s briefings. “It is all the presidential administration with their giant printer, there are no differences of opinion available,” said Vasily Gatov, a Russian media analyst based in the United States. “They will not risk interpreting reports from the Ministry of Defense.” When it comes to the Moskva, Russian media reports have stuck to the official version promulgated by the ministry and echoed on TASS, a state news agency. That version held that a fire onboard had ignited an ammunition magazine, seriously damaging the Moskva, named for the Russian capital.
0~Obama Caught on Microphone Telling Medvedev of ‘Flexibility’~President Obama found his private moment of political candor caught by a live microphone on Monday as he told President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia that he would have “more flexibility” to negotiate on the delicate issue of missile defense after the November election, which Mr. Obama apparently feels confident he will win. Mr. Obama’s Republican adversaries seized on the comment, which followed a meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev in Seoul, South Korea, where both had struggled to find common ground amid strong objections in Russia to the American plans for a missile defense system based in Europe. As a pool of television journalists gathered for a news conference on the leaders’ meeting, Mr. Obama leaned in to deliver private assurances to Mr. Medvedev. But speaking inadvertently into an open microphone, he offered a frank assessment of the difficulty of reaching a deal — on this or any other subject — in an election year.
0~N.Y.’s Legal Limbo: Pandemic Creates Backlog of 39,200 Criminal Cases~Weeden Wetmore, the district attorney in upstate Chemung County, convened a remote preliminary hearing last month — on the portico of his office. The judge was at the local county courthouse, the defendant in the county jail, and the defense lawyer at his office. The witness, a 17-year-old girl who said she had been robbed at knifepoint, arrived to testify on a bicycle. Mr. Wetmore plans to continue the al fresco hearings for as long as possible. “We’re praying for good weather,” he said. In Queens, Ms. Katz has set aside six rooms on three floors of her office so that simultaneous hearings can be held. Each room has its own feed: three for her prosecutors and three for their witnesses. The witnesses could not be in the same room as prosecutors to avoid suggestions that they were being coached. “The criminal justice system is not exactly known for its flexibility,” said Jennifer Naiburg, the chief deputy prosecutor in Queens. “We’re definitely flexible now.” The city’s two federal courts, in Manhattan and Brooklyn, have adapted more smoothly to the crisis. Under their auspices, grand jurors began meeting again recently outside the city, in White Plains and Central Islip. And in both courts, regular audio and video hearings have been held, with dial-in numbers for the public clearly posted on electronic dockets. But obstacles remain, like how to bring in large numbers of prospective jurors for screening. Take the capital case of the Uzbek man accused in a 2017 terrorist attack that killed eight people on a Manhattan bike path. More than 1,000 prospective jurors had come in to fill out jury-selection questionnaires, but later were dismissed after Judge Vernon S. Broderick postponed the trial indefinitely because of the pandemic. The process would have to be redone. At a teleconference in April, a jury official explained that bringing in so many potential jurors might take three days “with things being normal.” But, with social-distancing guidelines, she added, “I don’t know what the new normal would be.” Shaila Dewan contributed reporting.
0~A Timeline of the Nxivm Sex Cult Case~[Read our coverage of Keith Raniere’s sentencing.] In October, Keith Raniere was sentenced to 120 years in prison for his role in leading a cultlike group called Nxivm, in which a harem of sexual “slaves” were branded with his initials on their pelvises and coerced into having sex with him. These women were taught to revere him and were ordered to maintain near-starvation diets to achieve the physique he found desirable. One of the victims was 15 years old when the abuse began. On Wednesday, Allison Mack, an actress who pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges for her role in Nxivm, was sentenced to three years in prison. Here is a timeline of some of the events that led to Nxivm’s downfall. 1998 Nxivm was founded. Mr. Raniere and Nancy Salzman, a former psychiatric nurse, founded Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ee-um) as a purported self-help organization near Albany, N.Y.
0~Iraq’s President, Jalal Talabani, Is Said to Be in a Coma After Stroke~BAGHDAD — Jalal Talabani, the president of Iraq, whose influence in mediating disputes among the country’s many political factions has far outweighed the limited powers of the office he occupies, suffered a stroke and was in grave health on Tuesday in a Baghdad hospital. Mr. Talabani’s illness cast a shadow over the Kurdish lands in the north where he once fought a guerrilla war and where he now lives, and added a new element of uncertainty to the country’s divided politics a year after the departure of the American military left Iraq’s leaders to steer the country’s shaky democracy on their own. Officials and doctors said Mr. Talabani, 79, who has been treated abroad for medical conditions in recent years, was in stable condition, but privately other officials suggested his condition was more serious. A hospital official, as well as a high-level government official — both of whom requested anonymity out of respect for Mr. Talabani’s family — said the president was in a coma.
0~A Leading Choreographer Joins the War Effort, With Classical Ballet~On a Sunday in late August, a Dutch ballet master they have been working with, Rinus Sprong, led a company class outdoors, in front of the Russian Embassy — ballet class as civil protest. With time and effort, the group has made great strides, the Ratmanskys agreed. And there is something special about their dancing, they said. “Compared to their Russian colleagues, who are overwhelmed by rules of how to behave onstage,” said Ratmansky, “they’re more free and a bit more down to earth, more alive.” This was borne out at the first tryout performance of “Giselle,” at Alphen aan den Rijn, a small city about half an hour from The Hague, on Aug. 13. When it ended, after their bows, the curtain opened once more and the dancers, some still in their costumes, others wearing street clothes, sang the Ukrainian national anthem. Ratmansky held up a large Ukrainian flag. People in the audience and onstage were moved to tears. On the bus back to The Hague, the dancers listened to Ukrainian songs. Many sang along. The next day the Ratmanskys flew to Seattle, where he will be creating a new work — his first since the invasion — for Pacific Northwest Ballet, premiering on Sept. 23. Ratmansky is known for the dynamism and wit of his ballets, for his belief in the expressive potential of classical dance, and his ability to draw technically exciting, dramatically nuanced performances out of dancers. His career reveals a vast range of interests, from the revival of forgotten works — including Shostakovich’s ballet “The Bright Stream” for the Bolshoi — to the creation of ballets that refer to both the past and the present, like his 2006 “Russian Seasons,” for New York City Ballet and his “Shostakovich Trilogy” and “Songs of Bukovina” for American Ballet Theater. Since 2014, he has also taken a keen interest in recreating the original style and steps of classics like “The Sleeping Beauty” and “Swan Lake,” by learning to decode, and bringing to life, notations created shortly after the ballets were first performed. In Seattle, Ratmansky will be using the music of a living Ukrainian composer, Valentin Silvestrov, and designs by the Ukrainian artist Matvei Vaisberg. “It is,” he said, “a little bit like a return.”
0~Russia Finally Falls, Leaving a Trail of Admirers and Doubters~The Mail on Sunday, a British newspaper, has claimed FIFA knew of cover-ups in Russian soccer 18 months before this tournament started. Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, told USA Today in the past week, “We’re fools to believe it’s any different this time around from what happened in Sochi.” Denis Cheryshev, one of Russia’s breakout stars, has been forced to deny taking a growth hormone after his own father — apparently misquoted — suggested he had. There is no documentary evidence of any wrongdoing, of course. It is all supposition and conjecture. It would all be roundly rejected not only by the Russian authorities but by much of the Russian people, inclined to be suspicious of anything any government tells them. But in that climate, seeing a Russian team not only surpassing its fans’ wildest expectations, but doing so by running farther than every other team here — and by some considerable distance — it is hardly unreasonable to withhold a little affection for this Russian team, to wonder if what we have seen is real. That is the price you pay, of course — just as all cyclists are vulnerable to being tarred by the sins of the past, regardless of their own guilt, so too all Russian athletes are now, unfairly, greeted with skepticism. But that is not to say that the culpable always bear the cost alone. Presuming their innocence, they are victims here, too. They are the ones who should be receiving garlands of praise for all they have done, and not dealing with any innuendo and rumor. From the way they responded to the end of their journey, there is no question that it has all seemed real to the players, and to the staff. They arrived here in Sochi believing, with all of their hearts, that they could sustain this monthlong fantasy for a few more days. When Cheryshev scored yet another wonderful goal in this dreamlike summer of his, it seemed they might; when Fernandes drew the game back to 2-2, deep into extra time, forcing yet another penalty shootout, the whole stadium seemed to believe fate and fortune were on Russia’s side. And when, in the middle of the shootout, Dzagoev urged the crowd to make yet more noise, to make itself heard out across the Black Sea and into Turkey, and in the caldron, Mateo Kovacic duly missed his spot kick for Croatia, it seemed that, once more, they were.
0~Millions of Poor Are Left Uncovered by Health Law~A sweeping national effort to extend health coverage to millions of Americans will leave out two-thirds of the poor blacks and single mothers and more than half of the low-wage workers who do not have insurance, the very kinds of people that the program was intended to help, according to an analysis of census data by The New York Times. Because they live in states largely controlled by Republicans that have declined to participate in a vast expansion of Medicaid, the medical insurance program for the poor, they are among the eight million Americans who are impoverished, uninsured and ineligible for help. The federal government will pay for the expansion through 2016 and no less than 90 percent of costs in later years. Those excluded will be stranded without insurance, stuck between people with slightly higher incomes who will qualify for federal subsidies on the new health exchanges that went live this week, and those who are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid in its current form, which has income ceilings as low as $11 a day in some states. People shopping for insurance on the health exchanges are already discovering this bitter twist. “How can somebody in poverty not be eligible for subsidies?” an unemployed health care worker in Virginia asked through tears. The woman, who identified herself only as Robin L. because she does not want potential employers to know she is down on her luck, thought she had run into a computer problem when she went online Tuesday and learned she would not qualify.
0~Players Criticize N.F.L. Over Donation Proposal~Jenkins said he was surprised by Reid’s decision to leave the group. But, he added, “whenever you get as many players as we have involved in the coalition, there’s always differences of opinions. But we have made a real effort to make sure that everyone has been included, they’ve been informed and it’s been a pretty transparent process.” The plan, the details of which were first reported by ESPN, calls for donations of up to $100 million over seven years from the league, owners and players to organizations like the United Negro College Fund and Dream Corps. According to a draft of the proposal obtained by ESPN, owners would contribute $5 million next year, with their contribution growing to $12 million by 2021. Owners would also contribute up to $250,000, with players matching that amount, to local causes in their team’s region. On Wednesday, the players coalition appears to have approved the plan over the protests of Reid and the other players who left the group, which means the owners would most likely vote on it at their annual meeting in March. The league also has been considering a change to its national anthem policy. The new plan does not include language that obligates players to stand during the anthem, though Reid said that it is implied that players should stop their protests. The league and the members of the Players Coalition, which is made up of roughly 20 players, some of whom have been silently protesting during the national anthem since last season, have been talking with the league since August. Their discussions accelerated in the weeks after President Trump criticized the league for not penalizing players who did not stand during the anthem. The players’ group, though, has fractured, raising questions about how many players will approve the N.F.L.’s plan and about whether the agreement will lead to an end to the protests, which have divided the owners and caused concern among the league’s broadcast partners and sponsors. In October, Russell Okung, a lineman for the Los Angeles Chargers and a member of the coalition, took the owners to task for making decisions on anthem demonstrations without broadly consulting the players.
0~Panel Recommends Transferring Yemeni From Guantánamo~As lower-level detainees from other countries have left Guantánamo, Yemenis have become the largest proportion remaining, making up 87 of the 155 prisoners there. A few are high-level suspects designated for trial, while a task force in 2009 and 2010 designated about two dozen prisoners — including Mr. Mujahid — for continued detention without trial. But the bulk of the Yemenis were recommended for transfer if security conditions could be met, which has proved difficult. Last May, Mr. Obama recommitted his administration to moving lower-level prisoners, and he lifted a moratorium on Yemeni repatriations. Since then, 11 detainees have been transferred — more than had left in the previous two years — but none went to Yemen. Still, administration officials say they are actively reviewing the Yemenis’ status on a case-by-case basis. One official familiar with the effort said policy makers were considering several options. They include trying to persuade the Saudi government to take custody of several Yemeni detainees who have tribal or family ties in Saudi Arabia; finding other countries willing to resettle a Yemeni or two; and repatriating a particularly low-risk Yemeni to see how it goes. The potential rehabilitation program, officials say, has raised a possible way to reduce the risk of repatriating larger numbers of the Yemenis. In a joint statement last August, Mr. Obama and Yemen’s president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, cited the Yemeni government’s plans to “establish an extremist rehabilitation program to address the problem of violent extremism within Yemen, which could also facilitate the transfer of Yemeni detainees held at Guantánamo.” About that same time, Yemen reached out to the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, seeking help from its Disengagement and Rehabilitation of Violent Extremists and Terrorists initiative, diplomatic officials said. The program, which was begun in 2012, has worked with Nigeria and other countries in the Sahel region of Africa, in Indonesia and in Tajikistan, among others. Its employees include Douglas Stone, a retired Marine general who was credited with successfully revamping American detention operations in Iraq, and later designed an overhaul of detention practices in Afghanistan. The United Nations agency held meetings in Rome in August and in London in October with Yemeni officials and a group of potential donor nations — including the United States — that are already working in Yemen, diplomatic officials said. The consortium’s planned visit to Yemen this month, which was postponed by the Dec. 5 attack, has not been rescheduled, the agency’s director, Jonathan Lucas, said in a phone interview.
0~SoftBank Says It Will Sell $41 Billion in Assets to Buy Back Shares~TOKYO — SoftBank, operator of the world’s largest tech fund, said on Monday that it would sell as much as $41 billion in assets as it seeks to vacuum up its own shares, which have dropped precipitously in the last month amid investor concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. SoftBank has used its $100 billion investment fund to bet heavily on companies offering services, such as hailing rides and booking hotels, that are likely to take a significant financial hit as consumers stay home. In a statement released Monday morning, SoftBank said it would use 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) from the sale of its assets to purchase its own shares over the next year. The amount is on top of a ¥500 billion buyback announced earlier this month. Taken together, the company could retire as much as 45 percent of its outstanding stock, it said. The rest of the money will be used to pay down its debt and shore up its cash reserves.
0~How the 25th Amendment Came to Be, by the People Behind It~The health troubles of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The long shadow of how Woodrow Wilson’s wife assumed a role in the presidency after he became ill. The assassination of John F. Kennedy. These crises served as a backdrop more than 50 years ago for Congress to settle what should happen if a president is left unable to govern. The matter turned up again on Wednesday, when The New York Times published an Op-Ed by an unidentified Trump administration official who wrote that there had been “early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment” because of the “instability many witnessed.” The amendment, ratified in 1967, clarified the succession to the presidency and offered a mechanism for an acting president if the vice president and a majority of the cabinet deemed a president “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.” The provisions concerning an involuntarily declared incapacity have never been used. [Read: Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, reportedly discussed the 25th Amendment.] In interviews this week, three men who were involved in the design or enforcement of the 25th Amendment — especially Section 4, which deals with incapacity — reflected on its history and the discussions about whether it should be invoked now.
0~Risë Stevens, Opera Singer, Dies at 99~Risë Stevens, the internationally renowned mezzo-soprano who had a 23-year career with the Metropolitan Opera, where she practically owned the role of Carmen during the 1940s and ’50s, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 99. Her son, Nicolas Surovy, confirmed the death. On the Met’s roster from 1938 to 1961, Ms. Stevens was a superstar in an era when operatic superstardom was conferred mostly on sopranos and tenors. A Bronx native from a modest background, she was widely admired as a populist who help democratize the rarefied world of opera. She was known to a large public not only through her recordings and recitals, but also through her appearances on radio and television and in motion pictures. After retiring from the stage, Ms. Stevens had a prominent second career as an arts administrator with the Met and as president of the Mannes College of Music in New York City. As a singer, Ms. Stevens was known for her acute musicianship, her expansive repertory, her accomplished acting and, in particular, her warm, velvety voice. (In 1945, Lloyd’s of London insured her voice for $1 million.) Though she occasionally sang Wagnerian roles early in her career, she soon abandoned them in favor of the less heavy, though no less rich, parts to which her voice was ideally suited.
0~Fire Prompts Renewed Calls to Close the Indian Point Nuclear Plant~To protect marine life in the Hudson River, environmental advocates have been calling for the Indian Point nuclear power plant to shut down for several weeks each year beginning in May. This year, they got part of what they wished for — but in a way they would have preferred not to. A fire that knocked out one of the plant’s two reactors on Saturday caused oil and fire-retardant foam to spill from it and into the Hudson, putting the reactor out of commission for several weeks. On the bright side, millions of fish and insect larvae are less likely to be sucked into the plant along with the billions of gallons of river water it uses to cool the two reactors. However, a large swath of the surface of that habitat remained coated in an oily slick on Tuesday. A spreading sheen was reportedly visible as far upriver as the Bear Mountain Bridge and as far south as Haverstraw, N.Y. — well beyond the floating, yellow booms set up around the plant, which is in northern Westchester County, about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. The possibility that the episode at Indian Point on Saturday caused significant harm to the environment fueled the opposition from several of the plant’s critics, including officials from the environmental group Riverkeeper and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has pressed for a permanent shutdown of Indian Point, and appeared there on Saturday night and again on Sunday.
0~Scale of China’s Wuhan Shutdown Is Believed to Be Without Precedent~In closing off Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people, China deployed on Thursday morning a centuries-old public health tactic to prevent the spread of infectious disease — this time, a mysterious respiratory infection caused by a coronavirus. Experts said the stunning scale of the shutdown, isolating a major urban transit hub larger than New York City, was without precedent. “It’s an unbelievable undertaking,” said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, adding that he had never heard of so many people being cordoned off as a disease-prevention measure. Still, “people are going to get out,” he said. “It’s going to be leaky.” By Thursday evening, China said it planned to extend the shutdown even further. Officials said they would impose travel restrictions on at least four other nearby cities — Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang — affecting millions more residents.
0~How the War in Ukraine Could Slow the Sales of Electric Cars~The prospect of prolonged geopolitical tensions is likely to accelerate attempts by the United States and Europe to develop domestic supplies of commodities that often come from Russia. There are nickel deposits, for example, in Canada, Greenland and even Minnesota. “Nickel, cobalt, platinum, palladium, even copper — we already realized we need those metals for the green transition, for mitigating climate change,” said Bo Stensgaard, chief executive of Bluejay Mining, which is working on extracting nickel from a site in western Greenland in a venture with KoBold Metals, whose backers include Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. “When you see the geopolitical developments with Ukraine and Russia, it’s even more obvious that there are supply risks with these metals.” But establishing new mining operations is likely to take years, even decades, because of the time needed to acquire permits and financing. In the meantime, companies using nickel — a group that also includes steel makers — will need to contend with higher prices, which will eventually be felt by consumers. An average electric-car battery contains about 80 pounds of nickel. The surge in prices in March would more than double the cost of that nickel to $1,750 a car, according to estimates by the trading firm Cantor Fitzgerald. Russia accounts for a relatively small proportion of world nickel production, and most of it is used to make stainless steel, not car batteries. But Russia plays an outsize role in nickel markets. Norilsk Nickel, also known as Nornickel, is the world’s largest nickel producer, with vast operations in Siberia. Its owner, Vladimir Potanin, is one of Russia’s wealthiest people. Norilsk is among a limited number of companies authorized to sell a specialized form of nickel on the London Metal Exchange, which handles all nickel trading.
0~The Crisis of Election Security~How did our election system get so vulnerable, and why haven’t officials tried harder to fix it? The answer, ultimately, comes down to politics and money: The voting machines are made by well-connected private companies that wield immense control over their proprietary software, often fighting vigorously in court to prevent anyone from examining it when things go awry. In Ohio in 2004, for example, where John Kerry lost the presidential race following numerous election irregularities, Kerry’s team was denied access to the voting-machine software. “We were told by the court that you were not able to get that algorithm to check it, because it was proprietary information,” Kerry recalled in a recent interview on WNYC’s “Brian Lehrer Show.” He was understandably rueful, arguing how wrong it was that elections are held under “the purview of privately owned machines, where the public doesn’t have the right to know whether the algorithm has been checked or whether they’re hackable or not. And we now know they are hackable.” The ballot box is the foundation of any democracy. It’s not too grand to say that if there’s a failure in the ballot box, then democracy fails. If the people don’t have confidence in the outcome of an election, then it becomes difficult for them to accept the policies and actions that pour forth from it. And in the United States, it’s safe to say, though few may utter it publicly, that the ballot box has failed many times and is poised to fail again. There are roughly 350,000 voting machines in use in the country today, all of which fall into one of two categories: optical-scan machines or direct-recording electronic machines. Each of them suffers from significant security problems. With optical-scan machines, voters fill out paper ballots and feed them into a scanner, which stores a digital image of the ballot and records the votes on a removable memory card. The paper ballot, in theory, provides an audit trail that can be used to verify digital tallies. But not all states perform audits, and many that do simply run the paper ballots through a scanner a second time. Fewer than half the states do manual audits, and they typically examine ballots from randomly chosen precincts in a county, instead of a percentage of ballots from all precincts. If the randomly chosen precincts aren’t ones where hacking occurred or where machines failed to accurately record votes, an audit won’t reveal anything — nor will it always catch problems with early-voting, overseas or absentee ballots, all of which are often scanned in county election offices, not in precincts. Direct-recording electronic machines, or D.R.E.s, present even more auditing problems. Voters use touch screens or other input devices to make selections on digital-only ballots, and votes are stored electronically. Many D.R.E.s have printers that produce what’s known as a voter-verifiable paper audit trail — a scroll of paper, behind a window, that voters can review before casting their ballots. But the paper trail doesn’t provide the same integrity as full-size ballots and optical-scan machines, because a hacker could conceivably rig the machine to print a voter’s selections correctly on the paper while recording something else on the memory card. About 80 percent of voters today cast ballots either on D.R.E.s that produce a paper trail or on scanned paper ballots. But five states still use paperless D.R.E.s exclusively, and an additional 10 states use paperless D.R.E.s in some jurisdictions. The voting-machine industry — an estimated $300-million-a-year business — has long been as troubling as the machines it makes, known for its secrecy, close political ties (overwhelmingly to the Republican Party) and a revolving door between vendors and election offices. More than a dozen companies currently sell voting equipment, but a majority of machines used today come from just four — Diebold Election Systems, Election Systems & Software (ES&S), Hart InterCivic and Sequoia Voting Systems. Diebold (later renamed Premier) and Sequoia are now out of business. Diebold’s machines and customer contracts were sold to ES&S and a Canadian company called Dominion, and Dominion also acquired Sequoia. This means that more than 80 percent of the machines in use today are under the purview of three companies — Dominion, ES&S and Hart InterCivic. Many of the products they make have documented vulnerabilities and can be subverted in multiple ways. Hackers can access voting machines via the cellular modems used to transmit unofficial results at the end of an election, or subvert back-end election-management systems — used to program the voting machines and tally votes — and spread malicious code to voting machines through them. Attackers could design their code to bypass pre-election testing and kick in only at the end of an election or under specific conditions — say, when a certain candidate appears to be losing — and erase itself afterward to avoid detection. And they could make it produce election results with wide margins to avoid triggering automatic manual recounts in states that require them when results are close.
0~The Fed Has Awesome Powers. But It Is Fighting a Virus.~“Don’t fight the Fed.” That old Wall Street adage about the Federal Reserve has never rung so true. After weeks of dropping like a stone, the stock market began to catapult upward on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Tuesday’s trajectory deserves to be called extraordinary: The Dow Jones industrial average’s 11.4 percent gain was its greatest in a single day since 1933. By the market close on Thursday, the Dow had risen more than 20 percent from its nadir on Monday — enough, in technical terms, to qualify as a “bull market.” Most often, I find it is pointless to try to explain the market’s moment-to moment moves. Despite the chatter, it usually amounts to little more than random noise. But there are exceptions, and this seems to be one of those times. Among the myriad, and often spurious, explanations for the market’s abrupt change of mood, I think there is a compelling explanation: the Fed. So does Edward Yardeni, an independent Wall Street economist who has published a new and exquisitely timed book: “Fed Watching for Fun and Profit.” In a telephone conversation from his home on Long Island, he said: “The Fed decided it had to really shock and awe the markets, and it did the job. You can see the results yourself.”

0~Moderna’s Coronavirus Vaccine Begins Arriving at Strained Hospitals Across the U.S.~Image The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine arrived at sites across the country Monday. Yanitza Reeves, a medical worker, received one of the first doses at Christ Hospital in Jersey City, N.J. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Just one week after the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine were administered in the United States, a new batch of vaccines fanned out across the country on Monday, an urgently needed expansion of a vaccination effort that is expected to reach vulnerable populations and rural areas where hospitals are strained as soon as this week. The vaccine, from Moderna, comes as the virus continues to spread virtually unabated: hospitalizations are over 115,000 for the first time, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Parts of California are down to their last I.C.U. beds and almost one-fifth of U.S. hospitals with intensive care units reported that at least 95 percent of their I.C.U. beds were full in the week ending Dec. 17. Nationwide, 78 percent of I.C.U. beds were full on average. On Monday, confirmed cases in the country reached 18 million, just five days after surpassing 17 million on Dec. 16. The growth in cases appears to be leveling off: It took five days for the nation to go from 15 million to 16 million cases and then another four days to reach 17 million. The total number of new cases on Monday was at least 201,720, with at least 1,960 new deaths. And with Christmas and New Year’s on the near horizon, health officials fear that more travel will push those numbers even higher. More than a million travelers a day passed through American airport security checkpoints on each of the last three days, a spike in holiday travel that comes despite warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly six million doses of the newly authorized Moderna vaccine are being shipped to more than 3,700 locations around the country this week, adding to the nearly three million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that were dispatched mostly to health care workers starting last week. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 614,117 doses had been administered as of Monday morning. The Moderna vaccine, which can be stored in a normal freezer and comes in a smaller number of units than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, offers particular hope for rural hospitals, which often do not have the ultracold equipment or staffing numbers to handle the Pfizer-BioNTech shipments. That vaccine requires an exceptionally low storage temperature of negative 70 Celsius and comes in units of 975 doses. Many of the first vaccine shots went to health care workers. Joining them Monday were residents and staff members of hard-hit nursing homes, set to begin inoculating their residents through Walgreens or CVS this week, part of a deal struck with the federal government. These facilities have felt the brunt of the pandemic: At least a third of the nation’s deaths have been reported in nursing homes and long-term-care facilities, and many residents have been isolated from loved ones for much of the year. OhioHealth, a hospital system in Columbus, Ohio, received 10,400 doses of the Moderna vaccine in ice-packed cardboard boxes on Monday. The hospital had already received nearly 2,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and Dr. Joseph Gastaldo, an infectious disease specialist, rolled up his sleeve to get a dose of that vaccine on Monday morning. Not long afterward, he got the news that the Moderna shipment had arrived. “We are all really exhausted both physically and mentally,” said Dr. Gastaldo, who said he asked to keep an empty vial of his vaccine as a keepsake. “Having everyone rally around being vaccinated offers a glimmer of hope.” More than 70 rural hospitals in Texas are expected to receive the Moderna vaccine and start offering doses as soon as Tuesday. “The burden is worse than it’s been in nine months,” said John Henderson, the chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals. “Their staff is completely worn out,” he said. “The vaccine is the only optimistic news we’ve had in a few months.” The Oregon State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Salem, also received its first shipment of the Moderna vaccine, and will begin vaccinating staff and patients next Monday, said Rebeka Gipson-King, hospital relations director. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 11 patients and 65 staff members have tested positive for the virus at the state hospital. The hospital houses 579 patients on two campuses, and the pandemic has made many feel more isolated, said Ms. Gipson-King. “This is a really big deal for us,” she added. “Just like everybody, the people who we serve at the state hospital, their lives have been disrupted.”
0~One in Five Americans Ordered to Stay Home in Coronavirus Crackdown~“We’re going to put out an executive order today. New York State on pause — only essential businesses will be functioning. 100% of the workforce must stay home. This is the most drastic action we can take.” “Everything is uncharted territory. Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the news any minute.” “I think I’ve been asking a lot of how we could have prevented this.” “Am I going to see another depression like my grandfather saw in the 1920s?” “Over the past few days, New York City has taken a lot of important measures. I’m just worried it came a little bit too late.” “I think I’m scared of having to see more death and from reading stories from abroad, having to make decisions about resources. And I’m worried people in my life are going to die from it. A few days ago, I had to watch a patient basically slowly die. I just felt helpless. This is the first time I’ve really seen people that I truly don’t know how to help. And they are coming in so sick that everything I’m used to doing to be able to treat them, I can’t really do.” “How was your day off, Mich?” “It was emotional, to say the least.” “Why?” “It’s just, like, the hospital has been insane. And every hour, like, things are changing. So it’s just, like, trying to keep up with that while trying to read about what I should be treating these people with, while people are rolling in the worst — I don’t know. They say in 18 days it’s supposed to get really bad. I guarantee you tomorrow we’re going to have like 1,000 more. The numbers are going to go up.” “That’s no problem at all. Thank you very much. That’s very nice. Thank you. Sounds good. See you then. Bye. Well, I have been working. A lot of people are not, which is hard. This place used to have 30 employees, and on Sunday we let go of 90% of the staff. We want to reopen so we can rehire people, you know? It was really hard to let everyone go. These are people that are at the level, they’re not wealthy, you know? This is a very harsh reality. And actually what the job is, is smiling through stress. And this is hard to smile through.” [Rain falling] “It’s go time here at the community kitchen. This is the time where we have to ramp up our services to be very sensitive to how people are feeling. People are coming to us feeling vulnerable. They maybe work in the restaurant industry. People who work in Broadway and in a lot of the behind-the-scenes, they’re coming here saying, well, I don’t have work. So those industries are the folks that are the first ones that we’re seeing come through. But we’re preparing to see more people come through in need.” “All programming at the senior center is suspended for the next two weeks. Stay safe and have a good day.” “So this is not business as usual. We don’t know what’s coming up if people have to stay in their homes for a longer period of time. And we want to make sure people are getting food, especially since a lot of industries are out of work. We are expecting a lot of new people, and we are going to be ready to receive them. This is all very new for them, and some of them are feeling guilt or shame coming to an emergency food program. So we have to remember that we do this all the time, but for them, it’s something new and something that they feel anxious about doing. We’re just getting them registered. They’re getting food. That’s our main priority is people are getting food.” [Sighing with exasperation] “I’m not supposed to touch my face. Hold on a second.” “I have prepared myself already, mentally, multiple times, to go back to Oregon and leave this entire beautiful dream behind me. So many people, including many of my friends, are working at bars, at restaurants, which are now closed. And now we’re all at home, wondering, Can we make it another month? Can our families afford to pay their mortgages at home? Do we just need to go back and start working, just so we can help our own families, the people that we love the most, stay in the homes that we grew up in? It’s hard to think that my mom or my dad are never going to see retirement. The best things that we can do right now as a community is just to give ourselves over to something that brings us true happiness. Because right now, it feels like it’s about to get very desperate.” “This is only something that we can get through if we’re working together. There will be so much suffering, unnecessary suffering, if we’re not really looking out for each other and if we only think about ourselves and our well-being. We have to be thinking about each other.” [Birds chirping]
0~Taiwan Accuses Kenya of Illegal Deportations as More Are Sent to China~NAIROBI, Kenya — Usually prisoners want to get out of jail. But on Tuesday, a group of Taiwanese citizens did all they could to stay in — barricading themselves in a small cell as Kenyan police officers tried to storm in with assault rifles. The officers succeeded, however, in dragging the prisoners out — Taiwanese officials say after using tear gas, which Kenyan officials deny — and put them on a plane not for home, but for mainland China. A video circulating on the Internet of the encounter shows a group of young men bracing themselves against a prison door to try to keep the Kenyan officers out. “Sir! We are Taiwan people, Taiwan people!” one of them yells. The episode outraged Taiwanese officials, who accused Kenya of violating international law and trying to curry favor with China, which views the self-governed island as part of its territory.
0~Security Poses a Wider Challenge for Marathons~The Tour de France, held in July, presents a much wider-ranging challenge, covering more than 2,000 miles. While the French government does not publicize most of its security measures for the cycling race, the police presence approaches the scale of an Olympic Games. Last year, about 13,000 members of the Gendarmerie Nationale, the force that provides rural policing, helped protect the three-week race at various times. When the Tour briefly entered Spain in 2007, ETA, the Basque separatist group, detonated two bombs along the road after the riders had passed. New York City Marathon organizers and the city police have more time to prepare because that race is in November. But it is one of the largest road races in the world, with nearly 60,000 runners registered and about two million spectators. Security experts expect the police to add security near the most susceptible parts of the course, including the starting line at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island and the finish line in Central Park, which are already heavily guarded. Spectators could see more random searches and displays of force by the police to keep would-be attackers off guard. “It’s a huge challenge and one that’s virtually impossible to protect from start to finish,” said Robert S. Tucker, the chief executive of T&M Protection Resources. “This is like calling an audible in a football game. We’re going to have to deal with it differently.” The police in New York will face their first test this weekend when two smaller races will be run in Manhattan, including the 9/11 Memorial 5K in Lower Manhattan and a four-mile run in Central Park. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Tuesday that his department would evaluate its security plan for patrolling the marathon and other road races based in part on what happened in Boston.
0~Amazon Puts Moratorium on Facial Recognition Software by Police~This week, Democrats in the House introduced a police reform law that would ban the use of facial recognition technology with police recording equipment. Some lawmakers have long worried about the technology, questioning manufacturers and the public agencies that use their products on how it affects civil rights and privacy. Civil liberties advocates began a campaign to ban the use of facial recognition by law enforcement in 2018, after a report by academic researchers found racial bias in the systems. The report found that facial technologies made by IBM and Microsoft were able to correctly identify the gender of white men in photographs about 100 percent of the time. But the systems were much less accurate in their ability to identify the gender of darker-skinned women. IBM and Microsoft quickly improved their systems. Amazon found itself under heightened scrutiny. For the past two years, the A.C.L.U. has led a campaign to push Amazon to stop selling the technology to law enforcement agencies. The group obtained documents, using open information laws, from police departments that showed how Amazon was aggressively marketing its technology to law enforcement. The A.C.L.U. also tested Amazon’s technology using the head shots of members of Congress and comparing them against a database of publicly available mug shots. The group reported that the Amazon technology incorrectly matched 28 members of Congress with people who had been arrested, amounting to a 5 percent error rate among legislators. At the time, Amazon disputed the findings, saying that the group had used its system differently than law enforcement customers did. Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat and one of the lawmakers misidentified in the A.C.L.U. test, said he met with Amazon about the issue almost a dozen times. He said Amazon was less open to criticism than its tech peers. “They were avoiding taking any responsibility for their technology in my opinion,” Mr. Gomez said on Wednesday after the company’s announcement. “They always had some excuse.” Mr. Gomez, who is vice chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, said he was glad to see Amazon halt police sales.
0~Lil Nas X Says He's Not Sorry for 'Satan Shoes': Still Processing~wesley morris Can I read you something, Jenna? jenna wortham Always. I’m always down for that. wesley morris OK, here it goes. jenna wortham OK. wesley morris “I’ve seen the messages, tags, comments and concerns.” jenna wortham Oh, not this! Ugh! Go on. wesley morris “And I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem — ” jenna wortham Oh my god. wesley morris ” — where I spoke out of turn or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism. I specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson, both individually, because I care for and respect these women. And I know I failed.” jenna wortham O-M-G, join the club, Justin Timberlake. wesley morris So that is Justin Timberlake apologizing in February for — [SIGHS] you know. jenna wortham Years of misogyny? I mean, my god, yeah, apologizing years later. wesley morris He delivers this on Instagram via what looks like his Notes app? jenna wortham This has been happening for a long time. And it’s just become the go-to way for celebrities specifically to post apologies on Instagram. But I also feel like there is this kind of subversive UsWeekly thing that’s happening, where they’re like, celebrities, we’re just like you. We screw up, too. We use Notes app. Like, we’re all the same, even though this is the 25th iPhone I’ve had this year. But it’s also become the stand-in in a lot of ways for the act of apology, which you and I have spent a lot of time thinking about on this show. We did a very special episode about it a few years ago about what a meaningful apology looks like and consists of. And I think the Notes apps apologies are part of this larger phenomenon of public apologizing. They’re one facet of an infrastructure that we’re watching emerge in real-time over the last couple of years about how people make amends publicly. wesley morris But it does sort of feel, under these circumstances, a little inadequate. jenna wortham I think under most circumstances it’s unadequate, because when you’re crafting something with the intent to share it publicly, it raises a lot of questions about the act itself. It’s kind of amazing that here in Rihanna’s year of 2021, the year of Rihanna’s internet, where most things are possible — wesley morris He could go into a studio and record an apology. jenna wortham That’s what I’m saying! wesley morris Yes! jenna wortham He could get all the edible arrangements he wants in the world. But nope. wesley morris So, yes, you and I are never done figuring out how to properly apologize, how to sufficiently apologize. And since we last had a conversation about the ways in which people are doing it and maybe should be considering doing it — including us — it seems like there’s been an evolution of the apology. So, this week, we’re going to talk about what it’s evolved into. [music] jenna wortham I’m Jenna Wortham. wesley morris I’m Wesley Morris. We’re two culture writers at The New York Times. jenna wortham And this is Still Processing. wesley morris OK, we should just say that Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears dated for four years when they were teen stars. They broke up in 2002. And after the breakup, he didn’t say great things about her. jenna wortham Right. wesley morris “Cry Me a River,” his jam from 2002, is allegedly about her infidelity. And the video is almost explicitly implying that the person in the video is her. jenna wortham Oh, yeah, the entire video actually is meant to turn public opinion against Britney and paint her as a slut. wesley morris And then at the world-ending apocalypse-inducing 2004 Super Bowl halftime show with Janet Jackson, among a bunch of other people, but it came down to the two of them doing his song “Rock Your Body.” And at the end, the dismount of the number is he turns off part of her top. You know who had to apologize for that incident? jenna wortham Janet! Her. wesley morris They did a duet on the stage, but the apology was a solo. And he’s apologizing now because he came up in this documentary about Britney Spears called “Framing Britney Spears.” jenna wortham Which you’re in and you’re really good in, and everybody should watch it just to see Papa Wesley doing his thing. wesley morris Yes, I am in this documentary. jenna wortham It’s also worth saying that one of the most infuriating things about this apology is that he lumps Janet Jackson into the mix. Janet Jackson does not appear in this documentary. Justin Timberlake was just feeling the heat because the documentary was huge and took over social media for several weeks because people are getting concerned about Britney Spears. She has a very special place in most people’s pop culture memories and hearts, you know? And the memory of how Justin Timberlake wronged her invoked the memory of how he wronged Janet. And deep Still Processing stans already know that we did an apology episode a couple of years ago. But since then, you and I have just been creating our own kind of taxonomy of public apology. wesley morris We can’t even — and can’t even get to them all. Can’t even get to them all. jenna wortham So we’ve got this taxonomy, and we’re going to work through it and see what it tells us about the cultural moment that we’re in. wesley morris OK, so, Apology Number One: the tipping point apology: The apology that comes when there’s so much public outcry, a celebrity — or let’s be honest, they’re people — feels like they have to apologize for something long ago. jenna wortham That’s right. That’s right. wesley morris Jenna, I will just say this. I don’t think this apology is that bad, this Justin Timberlake apology. jenna wortham It’s not that bad. No, no, no, it’s not that bad. That’s not controversial. It’s actually not bad. It’s very thought out. But the problem is not with the apology itself. Because he’s apologizing to the wrong people. The message this Notes app apology is sending is that Justin Timberlake cares more about what people like us think, rather than what Britney and Janet think. And they are the ones he harmed, right? wesley morris Yeah. No, you’re right. You’re right. You’re right. jenna wortham But you notice that he doesn’t say in the apology, like, I’ve had the conversations that I need to have, right? He’s not saying, I’ve reached out. I’m going to continue to make amends. He’s saying he’s going to do better, but he’s not telling us what he’s going to do. And some might say, he doesn’t have to. To that, I agree. But then why are you writing about it, my man? Why are you posting about it? wesley morris This apology, in some way, is none of our business. But in some sense, this apology is about us because before that halftime Super Bowl show, in Janet Jackson’s case, she was one of the biggest, most important musicians of the 21st century. And the idea that after the Super Bowl incident, she is just this stained woman — jenna wortham Ugh. Scorned, stained, erased. wesley morris Right, who now has to walk around with this — I don’t even know what her scarlet letter even is. But it’s the thing that’s haunted the rest of her career. And in Britney Spears’s case, who knows what directions that career could have gone in? jenna wortham Right, right. wesley morris So, we, as people who love these people’s art, we are kind of deprived of something, right? jenna wortham But let me tell you what’s not working for me, which is for Justin Timberlake to say, yeah, the industry is flawed. It is designed to benefit white men. And I have that privilege. I’m like, I’m sorry. You are not a cog in the machine. You actually have the power to redesign the machine. You do. You do. Please don’t talk about it like you are some passive passenger. You chose to look the other way. And even if you’re recognizing it now, again, what are you going to do about what you’ve learned? It’s infuriating the degree to which he removes himself from the apparatus of misogyny. wesley morris So what I’m hearing you say is that this apology is, in some ways, about retaining power, right? jenna wortham Yes, 100 percent. wesley morris You talking about power maintenance and confronting the problem that you’ve caused, it’s bringing to mind Apology Number Two: the burn it all down apology. jenna wortham So who’s our example in this category, Wesley? wesley morris Oh, well, we had so many options to choose from. jenna wortham We really did. wesley morris But we settled on a very recent incident starring Meghan Markle, Oprah Winfrey, Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne. jenna wortham This is like a multilayer bean dip. This is like a 10-layer bean dip of apology, which is to say, it’s very complex and layered. Basically, in the interview heard around the world, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry go on Oprah to talk about how they were mistreated by the royal family, and a lot of stuff comes up. Meghan Markle is talking about her experiences with racism, her experiences with the gaslighting, her struggles with mental health. I mean, it’s a very deep interview where she’s revealing a lot of personal trauma and really unsettling things, including about how the royal family was obsessed over their children’s skin color. I mean, just really insidious, creepy stuff. wesley morris Well, you know who didn’t care one whit about what happened to Meghan Markle on Oprah? Piers Morgan! jenna wortham Yeah, like zero you-know-whats. wesley morris He goes on the morning show that he co-hosts called “Good Morning Britain” and has this conversation with the show’s weatherman, this guy named Alex Beresford, who Piers Morgan invites on basically to talk about being biracial in the context of the interview. Alex Beresford says that Piers Morgan just feeling kind of salty because Meghan Markle cut him off socially. archived recording (alex beresford) And I understand that you’ve got a personal relationship with Meghan Markle or had one, and she cut you off. wesley morris And Piers Morgan gets up, leaves the show for a little while, just gets up, walks out of the studio. archived recording (piers morgan) OK, I’m done with this. archived recording (alex beresford) No, no, no. archived recording (piers morgan) Sorry. No. Sorry. archived recording (alex beresford) Do you know what? That’s pathetic. archived recording (piers morgan) [INAUDIBLE] archived recording (alex beresford) No, no, no, archived recording (piers morgan) See you later. archived recording (alex beresford) I’m being — archived recording (piers morgan) Sorry, can’t do this. archived recording (alex beresford) This is absolutely — wesley morris He comes back to have some more conversation. But the point is, he just left. He just walked — on live TV, just got up and walked off. jenna wortham Wow. wesley morris And then basically quits the show. He’s just like, I’m not going to do this. I’m done. I’m not on this show anymore. So then Sharon Osbourne, high priestess of the Osbourne household, co-host of “The Talk,” goes on Twitter to defend Piers Morgan, and then goes on “The Talk” to defend Piers Morgan and her defense of Piers Morgan. archived recording (sharon osbourne) Tell me when you have heard him say racist things and educate me. Tell me. archived recording (sheryl underwood) It is not the exact words of racism. wesley morris Then she feels such umbrage at the response to that conversation that she has with her co-host, including Sheryl Underwood, that she then goes to Twitter and posts an apology. jenna wortham Right, right, right. And she’s insisting that she’s not racist. And it’s also worth noting she uses a variation of the Notes app apology, which is the same style and format, but just designed a little bit better. wesley morris It’s like a pleasing pink color. But here are some things that she says in this apology. “After some reflection — ” just some, just some reflection — “after sitting with your comments and sitting with my heart, I would like to address the discussion on ‘The Talk’ this past Wednesday. I have always been embraced with so much love and support from the Black community. And I have deep respect and love for the Black community.” Here’s my favorite part. You ready? jenna wortham Yeah, I’m ready. wesley morris “I panicked, felt blindsided, got defensive, and allowed my fear and horror of being accused of being racist take over.” jenna wortham Yeah. So this is all happening. And then Piers Morgan goes on Twitter and demands that “The Talk” apologize to him. The Talk says we’re going on hiatus. The hiatus starts. wesley morris This guy’s crazy. jenna wortham Osbourne keeps getting defensive about this, but anyway, it doesn’t matter. Even if “The Talk” comes back, Sharon Osbourne said, you know what? I’m going to pull a Piers, too. I’m out. She quits, and there you have it, folks. That is burn it down, number two. wesley morris I mean, she does not apologize to Sheryl Underwood specifically, the person who was conducting that conversation that day on “The Talk.” jenna wortham And being talked over on “The Talk,” yeah. wesley morris Right, right. But I do think that there is a way in which burning it all down is kind of the only — it’s just kind of the way you learned how to fight, basically. jenna wortham Mm. wesley morris And if your apology is basically a mic drop, uh, I don’t know. That’s how you’ve been trained to communicate. jenna wortham But listening to you talk, Wesley, I’m thinking so much about the amount of power one has to have in order to be OK with self-immolating, rather than honestly reorganizing how they view themselves and thinking about themselves as someone who actually might need to make a different kind of apology. Because I think the burn-it-down apology style is indicative of someone who knows that they actually don’t have to reconsider how they operate in the world and how they take up space in the world. Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne are going to be fine. They can take on other jobs. In fact, they can find other places, other networks, other pockets of community that agree with them. So they never have to consider that the way that they’re moving or operating in the world might need revision. wesley morris Right, yes, there’s a whole infrastructure to support you when you don’t want to apologize or when you can perform having been wronged, basically. jenna wortham Which I think is something that’s emerging that wasn’t as fully formed a few years ago when we did this podcast episode. What’s most revealing about these burn it all down style of apologies is that it’s actually equally lucrative to not be accountable, and that we now have an emerging class of people who are savvy enough to know that they actually don’t have to repent. They don’t. They can actually build a lucrative fanbase off of being rebellious and not being accountable and let someone else clean up that mess. Who cares? There are people over here who agree with me. I’m going to go be over there with them. wesley morris Piers Morgan went right to Tucker Carlson a couple of weeks after this. jenna wortham Exactly. wesley morris I mean, the thing about people apologizing now, in some ways, is like, you also didn’t have to do it. [LAUGHS] So in this respect, I have to give credit to our first two apology examples because they didn’t have to apologize, right? I mean, Justin Timberlake could just have kept on going. This isn’t the first time. I’m sure Justin’s been aware of what he did and the people who have been asking for him to acknowledge that he did it for years. And I think that there’s something about this moment, especially when the intersections of white maleness and, in Sharon Osbourne’s case, just whiteness, intersect with — jenna wortham The courts of public opinion. wesley morris Yeah. jenna wortham And I just think we really do live in such an incredible moment of dialogue and dialogical interactions between people who would never interact before, right? Like, in the olden days, you’d have to figure out which mansion Justin Timberlake or Sharon Osbourne were holed up in and then mail letters to that house or drive past it and honk really loudly and try to get their attention. It wouldn’t be enough sustained pressure over such a long period of time that you know your fan base is actively talking about it. So they feel this pressure to respond, but they don’t always allow themselves enough time to think about the authenticity of that response. And so when they don’t get the desired outcome, they have another temper tantrum. And it’s just — wesley morris That they call it an apology. jenna wortham Yes, unfortunately, they do. But you know what, Wesley? I actually think I have the solution for the Justin Timberlake’s the Sharon Osbourne’s, and the Piers Morgan’s of the world, believe it or not. wesley morris Oh, yes? jenna wortham I think I do. I think they should hire Adrienne Maree Brown for a private consultation and just learn from the maestro about what it means to get called out in public and what should happen next. wesley morris They should hire a contritionist, basically. jenna wortham Yes, yes. I mean, Adrienne Maree Brown is someone I reference a lot in my work. And she’s a movement facilitator, which means she’s very skilled at managing the needs and desires of large groups of people with different interests, all working toward the same goal. And she has also been on the wrong end of a social media fallout herself. Over the summer, we’re in the peak of just turmoil online. It’s late July. There’s so much happening in terms of all these movements and uprisings and all the attention and newfound interest in Black liberation that’s happening over the summer. Adrienne writes a blog post, and it’s just sort of laying out some of the things she’s observing with regards to what we kind of call in shorthand cancel culture. So what Adrienne is identifying are these cycles of blame and shame that are being activated online and these cycles of pointing out wrongdoings and, essentially, punishment. So the blog post is called “Unthinkable Thoughts: Call Out Culture in the Age of Covid-19.” And she uses terms like “digital lynch mobs.” She uses terms like “witch hunts,” right? A lot of people thought the term “digital lynch mob” was not appropriate. A lot of people thought she was conflating terms, like harm and abuse and wrongdoing. So people she loved and respected reached out and told her, this really bothered me. I’m really offended. And Adrienne recounts going through all these waves of defensiveness and anger, isolation. But then she does something else with it. She gets curious, right? She says, I need to be curious about what people are saying and integrate it. And she spends a lot of time offline, talking to trusted peers, trusted teachers, her mentors. She essentially does what everyone says they’re going to do, which is listen. And then she figures out, what does doing better look like for me? So she ends up writing a book called “We Will Not Cancel Us,” where she writes out what happened. And so Adrienne basically rewrites the blog post. She leaves the original one up. But she walks through, here’s who I am. Here’s my background. And here is what I was trying to say. That’s not to say it didn’t cost her something. I think it was an emotionally and psychically draining experience. I think she’s still recovering from making a mistake in public and making a mistake that really upset a lot of people. That’s not a good feeling, you know? It’s not a good feeling to have people be like, you’re f-ing up right now. But I think what she really does is set an example for what it means to remove the ego and see every failure as a lesson. Yes, I did quote Rihanna. That is her first tattoo. “Never a failure, always a lesson.” But Adrienne also mentions it in her book, which is why I’m bringing it up. But it allows for something transformative to happen and to allow a mistake to be a prompt. I’ve read this book. It’s a slim text. We’ll link to it in the show notes. But you can also read it for free on her blog because I think unlike most people, they try to parlay their mistakes into more power, more money, more success, more opportunities. And I don’t think she’s trying to do that. I think she’s just trying to still lead by example and also work it out in public. wesley morris And I would say, by that standard, this is the third type of apology in our taxonomy. It’s the Evolved Apology. So let’s take a break. And when we come back, we’re going to talk about a different class of apology. And we’re going to talk about how one apology produces a series of apologies and maybe even some change. [music] So, last summer, there was, of course, that wave of institutional reckonings that unleashed itself, or that was unleashed, by the deaths of many Black people. And it seemed like every day there was a new apology of some kind. jenna wortham Every hour, really. wesley morris Yes, every hour. Is it 4 o’clock? Here come the artists now known as The Chicks. Is it 5 o’clock? Here comes Ryan Reynolds saying he’s sorry that he and Blake Lively got married on that plantation. jenna wortham Pretty much. That’s how it felt. wesley morris So that ended up revealing these more toxic situations. And those situations wound up requiring some kind of acknowledgment of contrition or apology. And in our little taxonomy, Jenna, I’m going to call this set of apologies the cascade apology. jenna wortham Ooh, yes, and there is one example in particular that best exemplifies this. So in June, the editor-in-chief of Bon Appétit Magazine, Adam Rapoport, gets called out for dressing in Brownface like a quote, “Puerto Rican.” And it’s so offensive and so angry. But rapid fire chain of events. He apologizes, he steps down. The Bon Appétit staff really drew fuel from that instant. They were like, this is our moment to talk about the whole host of problems at this institution. I mean, Bon Appétit is known for their cooking videos. And it comes out that the white hosts are being paid and their colleagues of color aren’t. I mean, it was just abhorrent. So Bon Appétit chef Sohla El-Waylly blows the lid open via her Instagram story. And it just unleashes a wave of posts of people sharing similar stories. It’s incredible to watch. So the white Bon Appétit staffers go on social media to apologize to their colleagues and pledge solidarity. And when the dust had settled, I mean, Bon Appétit had been desiccated. So many of the chefs and big stars had left. wesley morris Right, and so a few months after that, “Reply All,” a very popular podcast owned by Gimlet, a podcast company, starts a series about Bon Appétit. And it is intended to just go in and examine what happened that led to all these people leaving and to Sohla’s original Instagram story. And it’s hosted by a woman named Sruthi Pinnamaneni. And she opens the series by aligning herself or explaining her relationship to this racial reckoning moment and how — I don’t know — estranged she had been to — jenna wortham Mm-hmm. Herself, really. wesley morris I mean, it wasn’t, according to her, until all of this foment and roiling last summer that it all made sense to her in a way. And she started re-examining her life and her relationship to her Brownness, the white people in her life. But that awareness is directed at Bon Appétit’s collapse. jenna wortham But then halfway into the series, there is a huge “Bridgerton”-level twist, OK? It’s this Netflix mini-series type level drama. Like, it is media gone wild. It is like our N.B.A. playoffs. So a former Gimlet employee by the name of Eric Eddings goes on Twitter. And he’s like, listen up. Like, tap, tap, microphone on. I just want to say that everyone involved with this series, Sruthi and P.J., who’s the editor of the series, they also have done the things they are making a show about. They created a toxic environment at Gimlet, where I worked, where they worked. They were trying to squash our efforts to unionize, our efforts to secure equitable pay, equitable benefits, all the things that essentially mean everyone at the company is treated the same, right? wesley morris Right. jenna wortham But you know what? Eric really led by example. So, soon after his posts, a ton of other young non-white podcast producers started sharing their stories and their struggles and their difficulties in the industry, which this is something we need to be talking about, and this is something that needed to be aired out. And immediately after that, the Gimlet Union agrees on a contract for their employees. wesley morris Right, and in the midst of all these people coming forward and sharing their stories, P.J. Vogt, who is one of the hosts of “Reply All,” and Sruthi Pinnamaneni, the host of this Bon Appétit series for “Reply All,” they each come forward and issue apologies. And in addition to the apologies, they also say they’re going to step back from “Reply All.” Jenna, we need to maybe do some math here. How many apologies are we talking about at this point? jenna wortham I don’t know, but it is an exponentially high number. wesley morris I mean, it seems like what it’s forced at these companies is some kind of reckoning, both at Condé Nast, which owns Bon Appétit, and Gimlet, which owns “Reply All.” It’s forced some conversation about equity among the people who work there. And by the way, it’s not just the Gimlet is where “Reply All” lives, Spotify is where Gimlet lives. So there are these additional forces bearing upon these decisions. And there are some things that bother me about this Reply All, Bon Appétit Test Kitchen situation. jenna wortham What’s that? wesley morris Well, we’ve been exposed to all of this conflict and unhappiness within this workplace. And it’s similar to what happened to Sharon Osbourne with respect to that conversation she was trying to have with Sheryl Underwood on “The Talk.” We get to see this very public feud happen. And the outcome of the feuds is that the offending parties are no longer part of that conversation, right? They issue their apologies. And then they’re never heard from again. I mean, I think that kind of — that’s a part of the work that an apology ought to be doing, in some ways. It is just a first step to this other conversation. But I don’t always know that removing the person — I think extracting them from the problem after an apology is not really useful. jenna wortham There’s also a corollary effect, which is that it creates this overwhelming anxiety and fear environment, where people are just so worried that their neck’s on the chopping block. I mean, I think this is what we’re getting at in the course of this episode, right, which is that no one is impervious to wrongdoing. We all have to — one of my favorite editors used to always say, tomorrow is a new day to make a different mistake. And all you can do is acknowledge you’re human and that we all screw up. But what you do after that matters so much. wesley morris I think this is the problem with people leaving the environment in which these apologies have been — that they’re apologizing for, right? And I don’t find that productive. I think the apology is a first step. It is not an end unto itself. jenna wortham Yes. wesley morris And I also, I think that these are — we’re talking about ritual sacrifices. We’re not talking about amelioration. We’re not talking about making people whole again. We’re talking about a person putting themselves on the altar and, in some ways, chopping off their own heads. jenna wortham Which I think actually sometimes disrupting columns of power and concentrations of power is actually a really good thing. I actually do think that editor-in-chief of Bon Appétit should have stepped down. It seems like he was a huge part of facilitating a toxic environment. And I don’t want people to be sacrificial lambs, but I also want to acknowledge that sometimes things do need to be disrupted. I also just think that the infrastructure around the reparative and restorative work is deeply lacking. And the sacrifice/apology is seen as sufficient when it’s actually not enough. It is the first step. wesley morris I think a huge part of why some of these apologies don’t satisfy is that there’s no shame in them. I mean, I think that we’re living in a moment where people don’t feel any shame. There’s the shamelessness of the people who come together to try to force these apologies. And then there’s the shamelessness of the people who sort of whip them together or toss them off or don’t give them at all. And I think that the things that really resonate or the things that are effective are the apologies that seem to incorporate shame. I mean, I think owning the thing that you did is important. But I also think really expressing a kind of contrition about it is another part of it. And I think there’s shame in the way that the hosts of “Reply All” handled the reaction to the Bon Appétit series, but shame in some ways about accepting the culpability and acknowledging it to go forward. jenna wortham You know, Wesley, I’ve been really sitting with all these apologies we’ve been talking about and the reckonings that came with them. And initially, it felt so explosive and exciting to watch. So one of the things that’s different from the last time we did this episode is people are really using social media to call truth to power. Like, that has actually been really exhilarating to watch. People just come forward and share honestly about their experiences across industries. It has been transformative. wesley morris Right. jenna wortham But there’s a part of me that still feels — I still hold a lot of grief in my body around it because those people are still worse for the wear, right? They’ve told the truth, but that has taken a toll. And we don’t know how people are doing. I mean, I guess what I’m commenting on is, the assembly line is so in place. Like, apologies are made, the person disappears, and the rest of us, I guess, are feeling some sort of closure at the outcome. But it’s still wholly so unsatisfying for me because we still have this culture of fear on social media, this binary of good and bad, and frankly, no followthrough or caretaking. wesley morris Yeah, there’s also this part of this process where we also know the beats, right? Person A does something appalling, offensive. Parties swarm this person and say, hey, oh my god, why are you doing this? You should apologize. You have no shame. And then the person is contrite. The person does apologize. And you know who really understands the cycle and how rife with comedy it is? jenna wortham Call me by his name. archived recording (lis nax x) (SINGING) Call me when you want. Call me when you need. Call me in the morning, I’ll be on the way. wesley morris It’s Lil Nas X, a.k.a. Montero Lamar Hill, who dropped this video last month for a song called “Montero (Call Me By Your Name).” It’s set the internet on fire in part because he pole dances his way from utopia to hell — literal hell — and has a little sex with Satan. jenna wortham It’s not just that he has a threesome with Satan — which is to say him, his braids and then Satan. It’s that he slides down this pole in this hilarious and just epically long scene. And then he lands on Satan’s lap and gives him a lap dance. It’s just so naughty. That’s the best way to describe it. It’s like the naughtiest, queerest, gayest, funnest thing I have seen in months, like brought a smile to my face. wesley morris But wait, folks, there’s more! jenna wortham Oh, yeah, there’s a whole roll-out. wesley morris He then puts up for sale 666 pairs of Nike’s that he made with this company called MSCHF, mischief with no vowels. He claims that there’s human blood in them. And the shoes are for sale for $1,018. jenna wortham It’s so good. wesley morris So, here we have these satanic shoes. Those are for sale. Obviously, the video is — I mean, you forwarded it to me. And for the first time in the history of my relationship with you forwarding me things, I had already seen the thing you sent me. jenna wortham Yay, wow. wesley morris That is how on fire this thing was. jenna wortham Now that’s what I call a viral hit. wesley morris But obviously, there’s a whole other universe of people — and I would say a broad coalition of people — who think this is just the end of the world. And it’s like white Christian conservatives. jenna wortham Black Christian conservatives. [LAUGHS] wesley morris It is Black Christian conservatives. jenna wortham So in the midst of all this backlash and scrum coming for him, Lil Nas X releases another video on YouTube that’s like — wesley morris Sorry, I hate to interrupt you, but the actual video is called “Lil Nas X Apologizes for Satan Shoe.” jenna wortham And it’s just so brilliant because he’s like, hey, y’all. He’s on a couch. He’s looking a little mournful. He’s holding the shoe. And he’s like — archived recording (lil nas x) OK, guys, I see everybody has been talking about this shoe. And I just want to come forward and say — (SINGING) [EXPLETIVE] it, let’s ride. jenna wortham And then before he could say anything else, it just cuts back into the video. wesley morris This is a person who knows what a great apology is. And he is not going to be giving one. jenna wortham At all. wesley morris You know what I mean? Like, he’s just not. jenna wortham It’s just fun to see someone execute at this level of internet trickery, I guess. wesley morris Right. So I mean, what I love about it is that he’s defending art, not bad behavior. And the apology is part of the art. Part of what he’s doing in this satire of the apology industrial complex is refuse to be ashamed for what his attackers are accusing him of having done. And I like the way his apology simultaneously acknowledges the form of other internet apologies — even a style of apology we haven’t even talked about, which is the YouTube apology. It takes that form and essentially mocks it. I think Lil Nas X is a student of culture wars. And I think he understands that apologies are kind of useless under these circumstances. And he understands that there are people who just are going to expect an apology for anything at this point. And the joke is on them, because what really should he be sorry for? Entertaining people? jenna wortham Yeah. I guess, what we’re talking about is the parody of the apology culture that we now live in. And it’s actually so great because somehow Lil Nas X’s apology just turns into an extended pole slide. It’s just like another twirl down the pole. And it feels so great to see someone unabashedly do what all these other apologies really do, which is they just further the person’s own reputation. You know what I mean? They’re really just about the person continuing to invest in themselves, right, and their own reputation. So it’s just that but the inverse. And it feels really great to see. wesley morris Yeah, and so I think there’s a real power in being able to set these culture traps and see who falls through the thatching over the hole. And he’s just there the whole time, just being like, oh my god, I can’t believe you guys are still falling for this. This is crazy. And he knows people are going to expect him to apologize. He knows the pitchforks are coming. And he is basically saying, do you people never learn anything? Like, y’all been trying to come after people who make art for centuries. jenna wortham Yeah, for a very long time. wesley morris And you just need to stop. It’s art. It is here for a purpose. And its purpose, you can decry it. But I’m not going to apologize for it. I’m not going to disappear. I’m not going to let you cancel me. jenna wortham That’s right. wesley morris The thing that I love about what’s happening here is that he’s saying, this is all a performance, but I’m a performer, and I’m a better performer than you are. Instead of me getting cancelled, why don’t we talk about what you’ve got a problem with? Why don’t we actually talk about this? And so don’t call me by my name. Call me by my number, and we can talk about this offline. That’s our show. jenna wortham And once again, we are reading “Minor Feelings: An Asian-American Reckoning” by Cathy Park Hong. We’ll be off next week, but when we come back, we’re going to talk about the book. So there’s still time in case you want to get a copy, rent one from a library or get the audio book and follow along for the discussion. That will be happening on April 29. We also have a very special announcement. Bum, bum, bum. Wesley? wesley morris Wait, are the clubs open? Is that the announcement? Am I announcing that we can go back and par-tay? Is that it? jenna wortham There is a type of party that’s happening involving you and me and Instagram Live. wesley morris Oh, yes!

0~Blamed for Climate Change, Oil Companies Invest in Carbon Removal~“We have a need for low-carbon fuels,” said Barbara Burger, president of Chevron Technology Ventures. “The world needs transportation fuels and the public desires them, but they have an expectation that we lower the carbon content. And this is one of the options to do that.” But ramping up the ambitious ideas put forward by Carbon Engineering and other companies into projects large enough to have an important environmental impact will take considerable investment. Mr. Oldham said one of his carbon capture and sequestration plants would remove one million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually, a small fraction of the more than 33 billion tons humanity emits in a year. The sequestration process would cost roughly $100 per ton, which in Occidental’s model could be offset in part by the increased oil production it would enable. The carbon could also be used to make cement and other building materials. But in case of an acute global climate emergency, governments would probably have to step in to hasten removal of carbon from the atmosphere. Mr. Oldham said the cost of capturing and sequestering all the carbon needed to stop climate change would require trillions of dollars. The company’s synthetic fuel could also struggle to find markets because of its cost. David Keith, an applied physicist at Harvard who founded Carbon Engineering and sits on its board, said the synthetic fuel would be most useful for trucks, ships and planes, while cars and other smaller vehicles would more likely be powered by batteries in the future. “There is no way we are beating oil from the ground in a head-to-head competition without regulation,” Mr. Keith said, referring to carbon taxes and other environmental policies. If there is sufficient political will to deeply cut emissions, he added, “I think you will see a large amount of this technology in the next decade or two.”
0~Emma Corrin Is Fine With Not Playing Diana to the Bitter End~In a video interview, Corrin discussed saying goodbye to Diana and the significance of having a nonbinary queer person play such an internationally beloved figure. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Your season of “The Crown” was generally well liked and received 24 Emmy nominations, the most of any series this year (tied with “The Mandalorian”). How has its reception felt to you? Is it different from your expectations? It’s a weird thing, expectation. I don’t know what I expected. I was sort of waiting in trepidation to see what it would be like, and then with the pandemic, I think that things were just so different. Because we didn’t get to have a wrap party together to actually celebrate the end of filming, and then when the series came out, we’ve all been in isolation for a year, and then obviously we haven’t been able to go to award shows together. So it’s very strange. I think in normal circumstances, it would have been very hard to comprehend everything, and the pandemic made it even weirder. So it doesn’t feel real, especially awards stuff. I remember in the midst of everything, when the series was coming out and the whole cast was feeling sad that we weren’t together, and it was strange I wasn’t experiencing anything in real time. My friend who I live with said, “The most important thing is the work that you’ve done — that at that moment, everyone’s at home watching the series, and it means that everyone’s 100 percent focused on your work and not what you’re wearing at different press interviews, or where you’re going.” Diana’s relationship to the press and the tabloids is explored in “The Crown.” What is it like to become a known person? Does that make you identify more with Diana? It’s a very weird thing to get your head around. It’s a very invasive, intrusive sort of thing to happen. And I remember when I got the part, Benjamin Caron, the producer, said: “Life’s going to change a lot when this comes out. And even when the role is announced, if there’s moments that you feel overwhelmed by it or scared by it, or if you get followed or if your picture ends up in a newspaper or anything, use it, because that’s exactly how she would have been feeling. Use all the emotions around it, use the excitement, use the curiosity, use the fear.” So it was very helpful.
0~Yellen Warns Against Erasing Regulations Made After Financial Crisis~Ms. Yellen, who rarely spoke about regulatory issues during Mr. Obama’s presidency, has been increasingly outspoken in defense of those changes. Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s vice chairman, issued a similar warning about deregulation to the administration this week. “After 10 years, everybody wants to go back to a status quo before the great financial crisis,” Mr. Fischer told The Financial Times. “And I find that really, extremely dangerous and extremely shortsighted.” Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory policy consulting firm, described the comments as a watershed moment for the Fed. Historically, she said, Fed officials have deferred to politicians on regulatory issues to preserve the Fed from a backlash that might limit its independence to make monetary policy. “I think the Fischer-Yellen counterattack is unprecedented in its openness, and signals the strong commitment since the crisis by the Fed — at least this board — to a new dual mandate: macroeconomic growth and financial stability,” she said. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, joined the chorus in a lunchtime address. “There is never a good time for having lax regulation,” he said. “Any reversal would call into question whether the lessons of the crisis have indeed been learned.” Both Ms. Yellen and Mr. Draghi took the day off from saying anything of substance about monetary policy, although Mr. Draghi said in response to a question that the European Central Bank needed to be “very patient” in deciding how long to maintain its stimulus campaign. The world’s major economies are all expanding for the first time since the financial crisis, but the pace of growth remains disappointingly slow. The annual conference here brings together officials from around the world, and much of the discussion has focused on ways to increase growth. There is a consensus that monetary policy has done what it can.

0~India Gay Sex Ban Is Struck Down. ‘Indefensible,’ Court Says.~For several years, Section 377 was in the cross hairs, with the courts going back and forth. In 2009, a court in New Delhi ruled that the law could not be applied to consensual sex. But Hindu, Muslim and Christian groups filed appeals in the Supreme Court, and in 2013, the court restored the law, saying that Parliament, and not the courts, should take up the issue. In its decision that year, the Supreme Court said only a “minuscule fraction of the country’s population constitute lesbians, gays, bisexuals or transgenders.” But gay activists did not give up. They regrouped and began looking for people willing to serve as petitioners and endure the personal scrutiny the case would bring. In 2016, five gay and lesbian Indians submitted a writ petition challenging Section 377 on the basis that it violated their rights to equality and liberty. The initial group of petitioners in the latest challenge included Mr. Johar, a dancer, and his partner, Mr. Mehra, a journalist; Ritu Dalmia, a celebrity chef; Ayesha Kapur, a businesswoman; and Aman Nath, a hotelier. As the Supreme Court prepared to hear the case, more than 25 other Indians with varied social and economic backgrounds joined them. Among those to file a petition was Anurag Kalia, 25, an engineer living in Bangalore, who was once so afraid to say the word “gay” that he practiced doing so in front of the mirror. “I used to whisper it,” he said. As the court prepared to announce its verdict on Thursday, Mr. Kalia checked his phone “like crazy,” he said. After the ruling, he stepped out of his office for a few quiet moments, feeling ready to celebrate, a bit numb, unsure of what the future held, but also feeling “relief, relief.” “It feels like there’s much more to come,” he said. “This is just the first strike.”
0~In ‘The Crown,’ a Young Queen, but a Young Woman, Too~LONDON — The Queen, dressed in black, protected from the drizzling rain by a large umbrella, looked up at the statue on its plinth before her; it was draped in the British flag. Around her stood flocks of dark-suited dignitaries; below, in the wide avenue called the Mall, a massed crowd waited silently. She began a short speech in her distinctively high-pitched, clear voice, then tugged the string that would pull down the flag to reveal the statue. It began to slide, then stuck halfway. A team of helpers rushed in. Claire Foy, playing the young Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix’s new series, “The Crown,” laughed. “I bet that never happens!” she said. It was a gray, damp day last December, perfectly suited to the otherwise solemn scene being filmed, in which Elizabeth was about to unveil a statue of her father, King George VI. His death three years earlier, at 56, had suddenly transformed her from a shy young wife and mother into a queen. And at this moment, it becomes clear that Elizabeth — unlike her tearful mother and sister nearby — is able to conquer her swirling emotions and fully inhabit her public persona. That conflict between private and public, between woman and queen, is the central subject of “The Crown,” an ambitious, sumptuous television production about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II that will have its Season 1 debut on Friday, Nov. 4, in all of Netflix’s 190 territories.

Rusia Estados Unidos China Reino Unido Francia Nota: Los mapas incluyen los alcances de misiles terrestres y los lanzados desde submarinos. Fuente: CSIS Missile Defense Project. Corea del Norte ha aumentado de manera drástica el alcance de sus misiles. En pruebas hechas en 2017 demostró que probablemente pueda atacar Estados Unidos. Corea del Norte Es una de varias naciones que han estado trabajando para mejorar el alcance y la exactitud de sus misiles. Israel India Arabia Saudita Irán Pakistán Corea del Sur Taiwán “Creemos que es el principio de un renacimiento de los misiles”, dijo Ian Williams, director asociado del Centro para Estudios Estratégicos e Internacionales (CSIS, por su sigla en inglés), que ha recopilado datos de programas de misiles en varios países. Una cantidad cada vez mayor de naciones con acceso a los misiles representa más tensiones regionales y hace más factible una guerra, dijo Williams. Los países son más propensos a utilizar su arsenal si creen que los misiles podrían ser un blanco. Además, muchos de los misiles en desarrollo en estos países están basados en tecnologías obsoletas, lo que los hace menos certeros y aumenta los riesgos que enfrentarían civiles. También está el peligro de que los misiles queden en manos de milicias o grupos terroristas. Varios de los países que han invertido en misiles en las últimas dos décadas están en zonas conflictivas en Asia y Medio Oriente. Los alcances máximos aparecen en este mapa. Alcance máximo estimado de un misil Arabia Saudita Israel Corea del Norte Irán Corea del Sur Taiwán Pakistán India El mapa muestra países con la capacidad de atacar blancos a distancias mayores de 300 kilómetros y que han buscado aumentar su arsenal en las últimas dos décadas. Los países que invierten en misiles usualmente quieren disuadir a rivales regionales. Pero los efectos de esa carrera armamentista son globales. Corea del Norte es un ejemplo de esos peligros. Los estimados del alcance máximo de un misil pasaron de los 1200 kilómetros en 1990 a más de 12.000 kilómetros. Eso es suficiente para atacar en la mitad del mundo, incluido Estados Unidos continental. (En ese mismo periodo Corea del Sur aumentó su capacidad y ahora puede atacar cualquier punto de Corea del Norte). Corea del Norte Corea del Sur Países como Irán, Corea del Norte y Pakistán tienen programas armamentistas sólidos. Y son bastante similares, lo que sugiere que han colaborado para compartirse tecnología entre sí. Pakistán comenzó a invertir más en el programa de misiles en los años noventa y se cree que también ha colaborado con China. Para mediados de la década de dos mil, Pakistán ya podía atacar casi cualquier punto de India, su principal rival. Pakistán India Mientras, India desarrolló la capacidad de atacar cualquier parte de Pakistán y la mayoría de China, otro rival regional, en las últimas dos décadas. India ahora está colaborando con Rusia para desarrollar misiles de crucero. Arabia Saudita e Israel ya podían atacar Irán desde antes de los noventa. Aunque ahora Irán puede actuar en represalia gracias a tecnología que, en parte, consiguió de Corea del Norte. Arabia Saudita Israel Irán Además, tanto India como Corea del Norte han trabajado en misiles balísticos lanzados desde un submarino, lo que permitiría a ambas naciones esconder su armamento para lanzamientos en represalia. Otro tema que causa alarma es el acceso a los misiles por parte de milicias o grupos terroristas. Por ejemplo: en noviembre, un misil balístico lanzado desde Yemen alcanzó la capital saudita. El misil fue disparado por rebeldes hutíes, una milicia chiita que controla buena parte de Yemen desde hace unos tres años y que cuenta con el respaldo de Irán y Hezbolá, de Líbano. La Liga Árabe ha acusado a los hutíes de disparar decenas de misiles contra Arabia Saudita desde que el reino lanzó una ofensiva para expulsar a los rebeldes en 2015. 800 kilómetros Alcance mínimo estimado del misil de los hutíes.

Korean Central News Agency El misil desempeñó un papel clave en los programas armamentistas de naciones como Corea del Norte e Irán. Las armas fabricadas por Corea del Norte ejemplifican lo difícil que es detener el armamentismo. Pese a décadas de sanciones, el país ha desarrollado varios tipos de misiles balísticos por medio del aprendizaje adquirido a partir del Scud. Algunos de los descendientes de este fueron vendidos a otras naciones.

Pero es casi imposible detener el tráfico de partes pequeñas, como sistemas de teledirección y motores, o de la información. Una sola unidad de memoria o USB puede albergar muchos secretos. Y, a veces, una sola pieza puede ayudar a resolver todo el rompecabezas: se cree que un diseño de motor soviético que consiguió Corea del Norte está detrás de los recientes avances del programa de ese país. Lewis añadió que muchos países también han aprendido los secretos de los cohetes y misiles y cómo construir modelos cada vez más amenazantes. India, por ejemplo, está trabajando en un misil que le permitiría atacar casi la mitad del planeta. 8000 kilómetros Alcance máximo estimado de un misil que desarrolla India. 8000 kilómetros Alcance máximo estimado de un misil que desarrolla India.

En un reciente comunicado, el grupo destacó la importancia de su trabajo para atender los cambios rápidos de cómo se desarrollan y transfieren las armas.
0~How the Fed’s Magic Money Machine Will Turn $454 Billion Into $4 Trillion~Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has a favorite talking point: With the Federal Reserve’s help, the government will turn a $500 billion spending package working its way through Congress into a $4 trillion booster shot for the United States economy. How, you might ask, does that figure? The answer lies in the central bank’s emergency lending authorities, given to it by the Federal Reserve Act. When the Fed declares that circumstances are unusual and exigent, and Treasury signs off, it can set up special programs that essentially buy debt from — or extend loans to — businesses large and small. The Fed could simply print the money to back that lending, but it avoids taking on credit risk, so it asks for Treasury funding to insure against losses. But those taxpayer dollars can be leveraged: Because the Fed expects most borrowers to pay back, it does not need one-for-one support. As a result, a mere $10 billion from Treasury can prop up $100 billion in Fed lending. And voilà — the $454 billion Congress dedicated to Fed programs in the aid bill can be multiplied many times. A separate $46 billion in the package will go to specific industries. This is how the mechanics work and who might get the money: What’s in the bill? Congress allotted at least $454 billion to the Treasury specifically to support Fed programs. It attached a few strings — for instance, companies that get direct loans backed by Treasury funding could be prevented from paying out dividends or buying back shares. Mr. Mnuchin is also required to push the Fed to set up specific programs, including one that would help medium-sized businesses.
0~Israel Passes State Budget~The vote on the annual budget for what is left of 2021 passed by 61 to 59 in the 120-seat Knesset, or Parliament. Voting on a budget for 2022 was expected to conclude late Thursday or on Friday. The 2021 budget was approved after a marathon debate that included a four-hour speech by a filibustering member of the opposition. A 60-60 draw would have meant failure. And if the Knesset did not pass a budget by Nov. 14, that would have led to the automatic dissolution of the legislature and new elections within three months, which was the goal of an opposition faction led by Mr. Netanyahu. Now that the government has passed the budget milestone, it will be far harder for the opposition to topple it. To do so would require a no-confidence vote backed by a majority of 61 lawmakers who all agreed on a replacement prime minister and government. That prospect, experts said, appears unlikely because the opposition, made up of right-wing, ultra-Orthodox and leftist Arab factions, is as ideologically divided as the government itself. “It’s kind of a summary of the differing wills of this government,” Nachman Shai, the minister of diaspora affairs from the Labor party, said of the agreement on a budget and its approval. He noted that a faction like his with roots in socialism had managed to compromise with others that support a free-market economy. “It looked like mission impossible,” he said in an interview. To keep the coalition together, the partners have agreed on basic guidelines that preclude grand moves on the diplomatic front, such as allowing the establishment of a Palestinian state or, conversely, annexing tracts of the occupied West Bank.
0~Tensions Flare as Cuomo Confronts Democratic Rift~As he looks to heighten his national profile, criticizing the Republican health care bill and President Trump’s immigration policy, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has been forced to confront a political schism far closer to home. For five years, a group of renegade Democrats has enabled Republicans to control the State Senate, even though they are in the minority. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has at times benefited from that strange reality: Having a divided Legislature allowed him to position himself as a deal-making centrist. But after the election of Donald J. Trump, pressure has mounted on Mr. Cuomo to reunite his party. Reunification was the agenda of a strategy session last month in Mr. Cuomo’s Midtown Manhattan office, attended by nearly two dozen Democratic state senators. When the discussion turned to how to best win elections, Mr. Cuomo suggested to the assembled lawmakers — many of them from New York City — that the leader of eight breakaway Democrats, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, had a better understanding of the suburbs than they had. That was all Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate minority leader who represents the suburbs of Westchester County, needed to hear.
0~Furious Lindsey Graham Calls Kavanaugh Hearing ‘the Most Unethical Sham’~Senator Lindsey Graham, the blunt-speaking South Carolina Republican, vented to reporters on Thursday outside the hearing room where the Senate Judiciary Committee was hearing explosive testimony about sexual assault allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s embattled Supreme Court nominee. Then he went back inside and really let loose. “What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020,” Mr. Graham, red-faced and dropping all pretenses of legislative comity, yelled at his Democratic colleagues. “This is the most unethical sham since I’ve been in politics.” With those words, Mr. Graham all but cemented a slow-motion public political transformation over the past two years — from an anti-Trump, maverick Republican senator who often sought legislative compromise to Mr. Trump’s closest ally and most ardent defender. As one of Mr. Trump’s rivals for the presidency in 2016, Mr. Graham called him “the world’s biggest jackass,” a “race-baiting xenophobic religious bigot” and a “kook” unfit to be president. For his part, Mr. Trump responded by calling Mr. Graham “an idiot” and “not as bright, honestly, as Rick Perry.”
0~College Football Playoff Will Expand to 12 Teams~The College Football Playoff, already a financial gusher for the country’s most powerful conferences, will triple in size to 12 teams no later than the 2026 season as organizers seek to capitalize on the nation’s vast appetite for the sport. The plan, which could quiet arguments that the race for national glory is too exclusive, calls for a playoff field of the six highest-ranked conference champions and the six highest-ranked teams that did not win league titles. The playoff will still rely on its own selection committee to set its rankings, and there will still be no guaranteed bids or caps on invitations for any conferences. The expanded system announced on Friday could be in place as soon as 2024, but executives must still negotiate the logistics and nuances that come with a larger field and a new surge of games with national-title implications. Whether or not the redesigned format starts that soon, Friday’s decision set the playoff on a clearer course toward the biggest television contract in college sports history, one that analysts have said could fetch close to $2 billion a year. The agreement on Friday represented a significant turnabout from the skid that expansion ambitions had entered, including an announcement in February that the tournament would “continue the current four-team playoff for the next four years.” By then, dreams for expansion, which some college sports executives had judged last summer as a fait accompli, had sputtered as leagues jostled over members, mistrust boomed and concerns over ESPN’s role as the playoff’s lone television partner bubbled.
0~Biden’s Pick for Bank Regulator Worries Banks Are Getting Too Powerful~President Biden has chosen Saule Omarova, a Cornell Law School professor, to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator overseeing the largest U.S. banks, the White House announced on Thursday. If confirmed, Ms. Omarova, who grew up in what is now Kazakhstan, will be the first woman and the first nonwhite person to serve as comptroller of the currency. The agency, which has about 3,500 employees, is charged with setting policy around the businesses that banks engage in — from traditional ones like mergers and lending to newer efforts like cryptocurrency. “I am deeply honored to be nominated for this role in President Biden’s administration,” Ms. Omarova said in a statement provided to The New York Times. “If confirmed, I will work hard to make sure that our banks remain stable, strong and serve the needs of the American people.” Ms. Omarova’s nomination caps a monthslong search for the top banking regulator’s job; the Biden administration dropped two earlier candidates because progressive and moderate Democrats couldn’t agree on them. But Ms. Omarova’s nomination will require Senate confirmation — potentially an uphill battle given the 50-50 split between Republican senators and the Democratic caucus.
0~Highlights From the 2022 Emmy Awards~Jesse Armstrong, the creator of “Succession,” with the cast accepting the Emmy for best drama on Monday night. “Succession,” HBO’s portrait of a dysfunctional media dynasty, won best drama at the 74th Emmy Awards on Monday night, the second time the series has taken the prize. Jesse Armstrong, the show’s creator, also took home the Emmy for best writing, the third time he’s won in that category. And Matthew Macfadyen won best supporting actor in a drama for the first time for his performance on the show. It was the sixth time in eight years that HBO has taken the television industry’s biggest prize for a recurring series, making it yet another triumphant night for the cable network. HBO, as well as its streaming service, HBO Max, won more Emmys (38) than any other outlet, besting its chief rival, Netflix (26). “The White Lotus,” the cable network’s beloved upstairs-downstairs dramedy that took place at a Hawaiian resort, won best limited series, and tore through several other categories. The show won 10 Emmys altogether, more than any other series. Mike White, the show’s creator and director, won a pair of Emmys for best directing and writing. And performers from the show, Murray Bartlett and Jennifer Coolidge, both received acting Emmys. “Mike White, my God, thank you for giving me one of the best experiences of my life,” Bartlett, who played an off-the-wagon hotel manager, said from the Emmys stage. But HBO’s chronicles of the rich were not the only winners on Monday night. “Ted Lasso,” the Apple TV+ sports series, won best comedy for a second consecutive year, as the tech giant continues on an awards show tear. Apple TV+, which had its debut in November 2019, won best picture at the Oscars (“CODA”) earlier this year. And Jason Sudeikis repeated as best actor in a comedy as the fish-out-of-water soccer coach in “Ted Lasso.” There were other big moments in the comedy awards. Quinta Brunson, the creator of the good-natured ABC workplace sitcom, “Abbott Elementary,” about a group of elementary schoolteachers at an underfunded Philadelphia public school, won for best writing in a comedy. It was only the second time a Black woman won the award (Lena Waithe was the first, in 2017, for “Master of None”). In one of the night’s most electric moments, Sheryl Lee Ralph won best supporting actress in a comedy for her role on “Abbott Elementary” as a veteran teacher at the school. Ralph began her Emmys speech by singing “Endangered Species” by Dianne Reeves, and received a standing ovation from the room full of nominees. Her victory was also historic: It was only the second time a Black woman won the award. The last time was in 1987, when Jackée Harry won for her role in the NBC sitcom “227.” This has been the most competitive Emmys season ever: Submissions for all the categories surged, and 2022 is very likely to set yet another record for the highest number of scripted television series. But there was also a sense of concern among the executives, producers and agents in attendance at Monday night’s Emmy Awards, that 2022 represents the pinnacle of the so-called Peak TV era, which has produced the highest number of scripted television series, nearly every year, for more than a decade. Netflix, which lost subscribers this year for the first time in a decade, has laid off hundreds of staffers and is reining in its spending. HBO’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, has shelved projects and is about to lay off a significant number of employees. NBC executives are considering ending its prime-time lineup at 10 p.m., and handing the hour over to local stations. Business challenges aside, the night was mostly a feel-good celebration. Zendaya won her second Emmy by taking best actress in a drama for her role as a troubled teen in HBO’s “Euphoria.” Jean Smart repeated as the best actress in a comedy for her role as a Joan Rivers-like comedian in HBO Max’s “Hacks.” “Squid Game,” the blood-splattered, South Korean Netflix series, won a pair of awards: Lee Jung-jae for best actor in a drama, and Hwang Dong-hyuk for directing. Those wins represented a major breakthrough for a foreign language show as television becomes more global, and as American audiences are increasingly receptive to series with subtitles. Michael Keaton, who played a small town doctor in “Dopesick,” took the best actor award in a limited series. And Amanda Seyfried won best actress in a limited series for her well-received performance as Elizabeth Holmes in “The Dropout.” Emmy voters often have a habit of finding a winner, and sticking with it, and this year was no different. John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” won the best talk show category for a seventh consecutive year, and “Saturday Night Live” took the best variety sketch series for a sixth straight year. This year’s ceremony was the first return to the Microsoft Theater since the pandemic. Producers for the Emmys incorporated an element that it experimented with at last year’s ceremony, which took place inside a tent: Instead of theater-style seating, nominees were gathered around tables with bottles of champagne and wine around them. This year’s host, Kenan Thompson, the “Saturday Night Live” veteran, opened the ceremony in a top hat and led a group of dancers in a bizarre interpretive dance to theme songs of famous TV series like “Law & Order,” “The Brady Bunch” and “Game of Thrones.” During his monologue, Thompson took a dig at Netflix’s recent woes. “If you don’t know what ‘Squid Game’ is, it is the contest you enter when you’re in massive debt and desperate for money,” the host said. “Joining the cast next season? Netflix.”
0~Brazil Arrests Head of Odebrecht in Petrobras Scandal~SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Brazilian police on Friday arrested one of the country’s richest men, Marcelo Odebrecht, as the fallout broadens in an investigation into corruption at the state-run oil giant Petrobras. The investigation, which is looking into whether subcontractors may have colluded with top Petrobras executives to overbill the company and pay bribes, has touched the highest levels of government and business. In the latest development, Mr. Odebrecht, the billionaire chief executive of the Odebrecht conglomerate, was arrested with three other senior company executives and the chief executive of Andrade Gutierrez, another major construction conglomerate. The federal prosecutor accused the executives of knowing that their companies paid bribes to politicians that added up to 710 million reais ($230 million). “We have material proof that they knew about the practice of overbilling contracts with Petrobras and they participated directly in the division of contracts within the cartel,” a police investigator, Igor Romário de Paula, said in a news conference Friday.
0~Kenya Cracking Down on 'Beach Boys,' Gigolos Serving Tourists~As long as the 60-year-old hairdresser from Cologne kept visiting, Harry Abdalla Ali found it easy to pay for his tribal rituals -- the goat that had to be sacrificed to ensure a successful fishing season, the livestock needed for funeral ceremonies, the dowry of 12 goats, 40 liters of palm wine and 200 German marks he had to give his bride's parents. ''She knew I needed to buy goats and would help me out,'' Mr. Ali explained about his German visitor. The global economy has often made strange bedfellows -- with those in the beachside bedrooms on this palm-fringed coast stranger than most. Mr. Ali, 31, is one of the thousands of so-called beach boys here who found that selling themselves to tourists was better than fighting for survival elsewhere.
0~Anne Bass Documentary on Teenage Ballet Protégé From Cambodia~Even if you don’t know your pliés from your battements frappés, the dance sequences in “Dancing Across Borders” are a delight. More problematic perhaps is a true-life narrative about a wealthy white woman (Anne Bass, a prominent Manhattan patron of the arts) who plucks a happy teenager (Sokvannara Sar, known to everyone as “Sy”) from his home in Cambodia and installs him in the School of American Ballet in New York. Charity is always double-edged, but you wouldn’t know that from this determinedly cheerful documentary assembled by Ms. Bass without frills or awareness of the need for an objective voice. Luminaries from the ballet world  including the inspired dancer Peter Boal (now the artistic director of Pacific Northwest Ballet)  enthuse about Sy’s dedication and soaring jumps; yet as we watch him power through alienation, exhaustion and the extreme physical demands of a dance form he neither understands nor particularly likes, another, less sunny story begins to assert itself. “Sometimes you got to do the right thing, not what you want to do,” says Sy in a rare moment of filmed introspection, and there is something ineffably sad in this grateful self-effacement. Offered only hints of life away from the barre or of Sy’s relationship with his coolly poised benefactress, viewers will see either a very fortunate young man or a beautiful protégé, dancing as fast as he can to please everyone but himself. DANCING ACROSS BORDERS Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Anne Bass; director of photography, Bob Elfstrom, Anthony Forma and Tom Hurwitz; edited by Girish Bhargava and Mark Sutton; produced by Ms. Bass and Catherine Tatge; released by First Run Features. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. In English and Khmer, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 28 minutes. This film is not rated.
0~Sunday in the Park With George~This means not only connecting the dots, as it were, that turn disparate sensations into art. It also means building the bridges that, however briefly, allow someone else to see as you do. Image Jenna Russell and Daniel Evans in a revival of the Sondheim-Lapine musical Sunday in the Park With George at Studio 54. Credit... Sara Krulwich/The New York Times The Georges are as isolatingly obsessive as ever about their work. But Mr. Evans’s performance in both roles brings out the heat of empathy and exertion that comes from artists looking outside themselves (or inside themselves, to see outside). As his Seurat moves awkwardly and self-consciously among the conventional Parisians of the 1880s, he clearly lacks the traditional skills of social intercourse. But what’s especially evident in Mr. Evans’s performance, which suggests the angry longing of an autistic child to play nicely with others, is that he does connect to people through reimagining them in his painting. That his art comes to immediate and fluid life lends the show a physical seamlessness  as if talent were a sixth sense  as well as a childlike wonder. The technical team here includes David Farley (set and costumes), Ken Billington (lighting) and Timothy Bird and the Knifedge Creative Network (projection design). While the 1984 production used three-dimensional cut-outs to replicate Seurat’s paintings, this one appears to draw those works  literally  into existence This approach allows the audience to envision the world as the George of the first act sees it, with landscapes and people, projected on scrims and small canvases, that alter as he sketches them on the island of La Grande Jatte, the scene of his most famous painting. (The animated dogs, in particular, are delightful.) Perspectives and colors alter with George’s moods and the seasons. (When autumn arrives, a pointillist shower of color falls from the sky.) The look of the show feels like thought made visible, just as Mr. Sondheim’s ravishing score, performed with gleaming delicacy by a five-member ensemble, seems made of painterly flecks of light and color. That the vision in Act I is largely Seurat’s does not mean that those around him have only marginal existence. On the contrary, I’ve never seen a supporting cast for this show that presents such finely individuated characterizations, including those of Michael Cumpsty and Jessica Molaskey (as a rival artist and his wife), and Santino Fontana as a young soldier.
0~Russian Parliament Expels Gennadi V. Gudkov, a Putin Opponent~MOSCOW — Russia’s Parliament on Friday took the rare step of expelling one of its members, a four-term lawmaker and former K.G.B. officer who last year crossed a political line in the sand, joining crowds calling for Vladimir V. Putin to give up power. The lawmaker, Gennadi V. Gudkov — a gregarious, rumpled populist in the vein of former President Boris N. Yeltsin — arrived at the Duma before the opening of the plenary session, as he has for the past 11 years. This time, though, as he entered he referred to the hilltop where Jesus was crucified, saying, “If this is my Golgotha, I am ready to climb up to it.” After he addressed the hall, someone hissed, “Judas.” Mr. Gudkov’s expulsion took place without any judicial process and was an extraordinary step, even after a summer of criminal cases against political activists. Unlike the young bloggers and anarchists who have been targets up until now, Mr. Gudkov, 56, is a full-fledged member of the elite, with contacts in law enforcement and government circles. By publicly stripping Mr. Gudkov of his status, the Kremlin hopes to send a warning to other insiders who might be tempted to defect. But it is a gamble, it was clear on Friday, as Mr. Gudkov used his last moments as a lawmaker to open a new political career.
0~Deutsche Bank’s Appetite for Risk Throws Off Its Balance~The global banking giants — think of JPMorgan Chase or HSBC — make a nice return by capturing their share of the trillions of dollars that course through financial markets each day. But few are as reliant on this business — be it swapping currencies, selling bonds or structuring derivatives — as Deutsche Bank, the giant lender that has made its name not as a home for German savers but as a place for hedge funds and other risk-loving investors to put on some of their boldest financial bets. And that is why its swooning stock price last week set off alarm bells in finance ministries, central bank suites and trading floors from Hong Kong to New York. More than eight years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers sent shock waves around the world, the fear is whether Deutsche Bank and its highly leveraged balance sheet of 1.6 trillion euros might teeter and set off another bout of financial contagion.
0~Senate Exit Polls~Data in 2012 were collected by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News. The results are based on interviews with voters entering randomly selected precinct sites and telephone interviews with early and absentee voters. In Colorado, all interviews were by telephone. The results are subject to a potential sampling error; those based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus 2 percentage points nationally, and 3 to 5 points in each state, from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who cast ballots in each of these elections. The survey in 2010 was also conducted by Edison Research. In 2004, 2006, and 2008, the exit polls were conducted by Edison Media Research and Mitofsky International; from 1994 through 2002, the polls were conducted by Voter News Service; and in 1990 and 1992 by Voter Research and Surveys. Direct comparisons from year-to-year should factor in differences in how the questions were asked. For example, before 2000, married was an item on a check list. Protestants have included 'Other Christians' since 1984 and 'Mormon/LDS' since 2004.
0~Blasts Kill 16 Seeking Haven at Gaza School~BEIT HANOUN, Gaza Strip — For more than a week, as the war engulfed their homes, families in this northern Gaza town packed up their belongings and children and headed to the one place they presumed would remain safe: the United Nations school. But in the last few days, the war approached there as well. The Israeli military warned on Monday that the shelter should be evacuated. By Thursday, the United Nations had decided to withdraw its staff and to stop providing food. Then, as the Palestinians gathered in the courtyard on Thursday, believing they were about to be bused elsewhere, blasts tore through the crowd, killing 16 people and sending scores of wounded, mostly women and children, streaming into local hospitals. The source of the blasts was unclear, setting off recriminations between Israelis and Palestinians over which side was responsible. People in the school reported three to five blasts and accused Israel of shelling them. Israel suggested that rockets fired by militants might have fallen short of their targets or that the school might have been hit with errant shells from either side in fighting nearby. The United Nations said it could not confirm the source of the blasts.
0~Lea Michele Is Well Aware That the Pressure Is On~The structure of the show itself will see some changes, including a new interlude of a Brice song, “I’d Rather Be Blue Over You,” that Streisand sings in the movie. Michele, like her predecessors, has tried to remove the pressure of the comparison, saying, “​​I will never be as good as Barbra Streisand.” Whatever performance she delivers, it will not be eligible for a Tony: Only the originating actress in that production, Feldstein, can be considered for the award. But the pressure on her to save this revival is hard to dismiss. Mayer said he sees this as a “second chance” for “Funny Girl,” whose ticket sales had been on the decline, dropping to an average weekly gross of about $760,000 in Feldstein’s final month from $1.2 million in the first two, according to data from the Broadway League. Prices have now skyrocketed for Michele’s debut: The most expensive ticket on her first night is more than $2,600, as of Wednesday. Despite the evident star power, Michele seems aware that she should avoid behaving like a diva. “Everyone here has been through a lot, and I just have to come in and be prepared and do a good job and be respectful of the fact that this is their space,” she said. A humbling element of the process is that she had to learn how to tap dance from square one, practicing with a nursery rhyme tap video one of the show’s choreographers, Ayodele Casel, sent her. (After the first tap rehearsal, she said, she cried in the bathroom, wondering if she really could pull this role off, before the steps eventually clicked.) Still, Michele admits that she is only just learning how to be publicly vulnerable. Online hatred of her can verge on gleeful, and she fears that if she responds to criticism — or a bizarre rumor that she is illiterate — it will fuel the fire. “I went to ‘Glee’ every single day; I knew my lines every single day,” she said. “And then there’s a rumor online that I can’t read or write? It’s sad. It really is. I think often if I were a man, a lot of this wouldn’t be the case.”
0~The Prostitution Empire and the Former N.Y.P.D. Detective, Always One Step Ahead of the Law~The complaints from neighbors about prostitution flourishing behind the Brooklyn apartment’s thin walls had been flowing into the vice squad for months. Men, arriving at all hours, were asked at the door which nationality of women they preferred: “Brazil? Peru?” Police officers swooped in one day in September 2017, slamming through the door with a battering ram, but they left empty-handed. The brothel on the border of Gowanus and Park Slope had quietly closed down before the raid, just as had happened with several other brothels around the borough, gone dark right before the police showed up. The brothel empire was always one step ahead of the law. Last week, prosecutors disclosed why: They said the brothels were run by a retired police detective who had been repeatedly tipped off about planned raids by officers on the force, revealing one of the worst corruption scandals to hit the New York Police Department in years. The retired detective, Ludwig Paz, 51, was arrested and accused of running a broad and complex syndicate of prostitution and gambling that spanned Brooklyn and Queens and brought in millions of dollars. Three sergeants, two detectives and two officers were also charged. Two other officers were stripped of their guns and shields and placed on administrative duty. Dozens of civilians were arrested, and more are being sought.
0~Meg Ryan on Romantic Comedies, Celebrity and Leaving It All Behind~From the late ’80s through the ’90s, Meg Ryan shone about as brightly as any star in Hollywood. You know about her beloved string of romantic comedies — often written by Nora Ephron, often co-starring Tom Hanks. Less well remembered are her dramatic turns in the same era’s “When a Man Loves a Woman,” “City of Angels” and “Courage Under Fire,” all of which were commercial successes. But the harsh reaction to her 2003 erotic thriller, “In the Cut,” a critical and box-office flop that was widely seen as a failed attempt to complicate her winsome image, as well as her growing frustration with fame, compelled her to step into a less public, far happier life. “I wasn’t as curious about acting as I was about other things that life can give you,” says Ryan, 57. She quietly made her directorial debut in 2015 with the World War II-era drama “Ithaca,” and last November, she became engaged to the musician John Mellencamp. “I wanted,” she says, “to live more.” Actors often talk about how their roles let them explore feelings that they might not otherwise explore. In the time since you began acting less, have you had to adjust how you process emotions? I felt in a crazy way that, as an actor, I was burning through life experiences. Somehow I was a helicopter pilot or a journalist or an alcoholic.1 I was living these express-lane lives. I’m not answering your question. Did you feel as if you hit a wall by burning through all those experiences? Or the blunter way of asking the question is: Where’d you go? My son, Jack,2 graduated from high school on a Friday or Saturday. I moved back to New York from Los Angeles on the following Monday. I was burned out. I didn’t feel like I knew enough anymore about myself or the world to reflect it as an actor. I felt isolated. In Hollywood or in fame? In fame and in work. Ever get in a car — maybe it’s a superexpensive car — and the inside’s lovely, you can’t complain about it, but you can’t hear anything outside, because there’s so much metal? There’s so much between you and everything else. You’re at a disadvantage as a young, famous person because you don’t know who’s telling you the truth. I’m not complaining — there are so many advantages to being famous — but there are fundamental disadvantages for a part of your brain, your self, your soul. My experiences were too limited. [Eight things we learned from this interview with Meg Ryan.] What’s something a person would be dishonest with you about? All of a sudden, I was told I needed a publicist and a manager and a lawyer. People fly in to help because you’re inexperienced, and someone says: “Don’t worry, I fixed the problem. Call me back.” Then suddenly you’re grateful to someone about solving a problem that you didn’t know you could even define. You’re doing things that people tell you that you need to do, but you don’t. You can function independent of all of that. Why don’t more people who’ve achieved the level of attention and success that you achieved pull back? I don’t know about them, but I don’t feel like, naturally, I’m a performer. I knew I was being given opportunities and that there was certain music I could play as an actor. Certain things I could do. And I liked acting. I thought it was fun. But acting was a situation I was navigating. Did you grow up wanting to be an actor? No, I never had that. You’ve done 30-something films, and about 10 could be deemed romantic comedies. But disproportionately those are the movies that did your best business. Were romantic comedies your true — I’m thinking of a word that I don’t know how to pronounce. Met — M-é-t-i-e-r? Strong suit? Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal at Katz’s Delicatessen in ‘‘When Harry Met Sally . . . ’’ Columbia Pictures/Photofest Yeah, were romantic comedies your strong suit? Probably. I liked doing the alcoholic in “When a Man Loves a Woman”; I liked doing “In The Cut”3; but I was very happy going to a set that was about: How do you find the funny thing? I like that again now, working on a romantic comedy. You’re writing one? Yeah. It’s at Working Title Films. I’ll just leave it at that. Getting the green light, David. My God. You feel like you’re jinxing it if you’re talking about it. Hopefully it’s for me to direct. I’m aware now that romantic comedies are confections, but they have construction. There’s architecture. It’s not something I was aware of back then. What’s the last good romantic comedy you saw? “The Big Sick.” And I’m showing my daughter all kinds of romantic comedies. We did a Frank Capra thing over Christmas: “It Happened One Night” and “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.” It’s easy to forget how good Jimmy Stewart was. So great! And Jean Arthur was a fantastic screen partner for him. There’s something very reticent about her as a performer, but she matched him so beautifully. Charm is part of the appeal of romantic comedies, and — this is awkward to say to someone sitting across from me — you were extremely charming in those movies. As an actress, can you consciously generate charm? Do you have control over it? Real charm is probably innate. It’s just there or not. I can see it in people like Jennifer Lawrence or Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling. They probably aren’t able to manage it. Somebody told me once that she was done with being charming to men. I knew what she was talking about, because the charm was sort of manipulative. I know you’re being humble, but you deflected my question. What about you and charm? I never thought about it like, “I’m going to turn the charm on.” Early on, I didn’t have a lot of acting technique. What I thought about was trying to tell the truth.4 The camera is a truth machine, and it knows everything you’re thinking, so you don’t have to pretend anything. You just have to make it true somewhere inside. Rob Reiner has said he doesn’t think a studio would make “When Harry Met Sally . . . ” today because the business is so dominated by superhero movies. Are romantic comedies undervalued by Hollywood? As soon as they make money, they have value. But I don’t think that because things are tragic they’re deeper. Think about Nora Ephron.5 Her observation about romantic comedies is that they were commenting on their time in an intelligent way, but with the intention to delight. Is it right that the Katz’s Delicatessen orgasm scene in “When Harry Met Sally . . . ” was your idea? It was in the script that Harry and Sally talk about the fact that women fake orgasms. Then, when we were rehearsing that movie, we had a lot of time to chat about the script, and I said that since Sally is such a behavioral character, she should fake an orgasm. That was my contribution. Have you ever been to Katz’s aside from that time? No. You and Nora seemed like a perfect sensibility match, but on some level, it’s funny that you, a gentile, were the muse of this classic Jewish New York character. Did she ever articulate what she saw in you? I would love to know. At times we would look at each other like, Hmm. But I was so interested in her. She wasn’t like anybody. She was different. On the sets with her, it wasn’t just about being directed. It was like, “How do you give a dinner party?” and “What do you cook?” and “What about a seating chart?” You were invited into her life, and it was so charming. I’m grateful we found each other. I also always appreciated that on a movie set she led with her intellect. Ryan with Tom Hanks and Nora Ephron on the set of ‘‘You’ve Got Mail.’’ Warner Bros. Pictures/Photofest What’s a favorite memory you have of Nora? She was there when Steve Wynn put his elbow through a Picasso.6 She watched the whole thing! So I have an image of her being delighted by things that people would say or do. And I don’t know why, I think about having lunch with her at Balthazar, maybe two years before she died. I didn’t know she was sick, but she didn’t look well. I didn’t ask. I don’t know if she would have told me. I don’t think she would have. I regret not asking, “Are you O.K.?” Maybe she would have confided in me. Were you happy with the work available to you as you got older? Would you have felt more compelled to keep exploring acting if those opportunities were good? I’m sure the same opportunities did not present themselves in my 40s that did in my 30s and 20s. I think the last movie I starred in was 10, 12 years ago. It might have been “The Women.”7 I get offers to do things now, but they’re not things I want to do. I have so much admiration for actors who have incredible imagination for life or have life experience that they can then bring to the audience. I don’t think I was one of those people. I felt like an unformed person. How did that manifest itself? I felt like I was behind a window looking at my life. That had a lot to do with working so much. The only people you meet are on the set, and you’re waiting in your trailer, and you’re memorizing lines — I remember thinking, I want to have my own thoughts. Also it was hard to walk around anywhere. It was never about people being mean; it’s that I couldn’t move. I would sort of duck and cover, and that wasn’t what I wanted. Then my son came along in the middle of all that. I’d say to some of the people representing me at the time: “Guys, don’t leave me messages that say it’s an emergency. If something’s wrong with Jack, that’s an emergency. ‘The deal didn’t close’ isn’t one.” I don’t mean this in a snarky way, but was the separation from Hollywood mutual? If “In the Cut” or “Against the Ropes”8 had been better received by critics or audiences, would you have felt differently about everything? It’s not a snarky question. It’s fair. I think the feeling with Hollywood was mutual. I felt done when they felt done, probably. Was backing off from show business part of coming to terms with a fundamental ambivalence about your career that had always been there? Nora used to tell me, “Just because you have fame problems doesn’t mean you don’t have a problem.” I like the famous I am now: I walk into other people’s paparazzi photos, but I can also get a restaurant reservation. Around when “Against the Ropes” came out in 2004, you alluded in an interview to obstacles that women in the movie business face. Can you be explicit about that? What were you butting up against? When I look back now, it was definitely easier to be the funny person rather than the pretty person, the sexy person. Not that I ever could be sexy, but I felt like that got into such a funky land. I didn’t want the problems. The problems of being a sex symbol? I never led with that. I felt it was dangerous because of the environment. If you’re a 25-year-old girl in Hollywood, you need to be aware of what’s out there. At the time, there was a self-perpetuating strata that wasn’t alerting girls to the problems. It’s good they’re being alerted now. I never had a man in a position of power play sexual politics. It got weird a couple of times, but I figured out a way out of the room. Sexuality in Hollywood is so complex because of all kinds of things: how women react to you, how men react to you, how wives react to you, how studio executives react to you. I don’t know if it was brave or cowardly of me to sort of bob and weave around the issue. But I know that when I did “In the Cut,” the reaction was vicious. How did that affect the arc of your career? I feel like that might’ve been the last movie I did. I was surprised by the negative reaction. I loved the movie and loved that experience and loved Jane Campion. When I went to England and did press for that, there was a guy who had a talk show. His name escapes me. Michael Parkinson. Parkinson!9 I was shocked that he was saying, like, “How could you be naked?” I don’t think I handled it well. Since then, I’ve had publicists say to me, “You should’ve prepared your audience for your doing something different.” “In the Cut” was a sexual thing, and sex throws people. I’d never presented myself like that before; it was so different from my assigned archetype. Probably I had a very neutered image. Carrie Fisher was the one who said: “No, no, no. When you betray your archetype by doing a movie like that and by getting divorced — you can’t.” Yeah, “In the Cut” felt like a real turning point. When you have a moniker — Ryan with Jennifer Jason Leigh in ‘‘In the Cut.’’ Screen Gems/Everett Collection “America’s Sweetheart.” Which probably makes you cringe. It doesn’t allow for the full expression of a person. But that’s what movie stardom is. There’s a blankness required. Aside from your work in “In the Cut,” which of your performances stand out now as pivotal in some way? “When a Man Loves a Woman.” It was a pretty amazing confluence of events. I was married to Dennis, and he was getting sober, and this movie came along. So in real life and in the movies I was understanding “What does codependent mean? What is alcoholism?” I went to Al-Anon meetings. I went to A.A. meetings. Because I was the alcoholic in the story, it gave me empathy. It was a cathartic role. What have you learned about how power works for women in Hollywood? I don’t think I took advantage of the power that I had. If you have box-office power, you can create opportunities for yourself. That was a chit I’d earned, but I didn’t work it. Somewhere in the middle of my time in Hollywood, I did have a production company and produced movies, but it felt exhausting. I had a baby, and I was acting, and they were giving me scripts to produce in various stages of development when I was getting scripts to act in that were ready. I kept thinking: What is this thing about having it all? Why do we want that? Don’t we just want to be happy in our independent pursuits? There’s an anecdote you told years ago, in passing, about being in London when your relationship with Russell Crowe was a big tabloid thing. You mentioned walking into a hotel and having everyone stop and stare at you, then getting in an elevator and having this clarity about the emptiness of tabloid attention. Can you unpack that epiphany for me? That was another big turning point in my evolution. I’d never felt like I was all that concerned with what people thought of me, but then that story never got told right. What story? The story of how I was divorced or what the actual problems were. It’s a real gift when you know you can’t ever really manage an image or a story and you stop caring. I felt the effect, like I was the bad guy or whatever the story was.10 But I remember letting go of needing to correct anybody. Divorce is hard. Love is hard. All those things were so personal. They weren’t for mass consumption. The complexity of a life or a marriage is never going to exist in a headline or a tabloid. That was a freeing thing to know! Though fame has become so democratized now. In what way? Even if you’re famous in just your office building or neighborhood, social media has given everybody the experience I had; more people are having the experience of cultivating other people’s opinions. Everyone is so happy on social media. It’s depressing. How implicit or explicit was the pressure to look a certain way as you grew older? The pressure was implicit. How you look — there’s so much judgment. You can’t win or lose. That’s an annoying thing, and you deal with it. You’re engaged. How is the nature of love in middle age different from love at 25 or 35? What’s great about now is that John and I are so free to have fun. Maybe that freedom is about being a million years old. But I sometimes think relationships are for aliens. Who does it? Who can do it? I don’t know how any of us ever do. I was listening to an interview John did with Howard Stern a few years back, and John said something like: “Meg Ryan hates me.” You and John dated off and on for years before getting engaged. Do you know what he was talking about? I have asked him that same question. I don’t know. In this period when you haven’t been as busy with acting, what does an ideal day look like? Well, raising a kid11 takes a lot of time. But I’m lucky because I can go places like a TED conference. I can go to Cambodia and travel around. I’m writing. I’m hoping to direct. I have a passion for design. I take pictures. Didn’t you take photos on a trip with Nora to a place called Dildo? I went with Carrie in 2005. She was hired by The New York Times! She picked Dildo, Newfoundland, just to go and write about it, and I took the pictures. There’s Dildo everything. I mean, really, they have a limited sense of irony about their town. Which makes it very funny. Ryan’s photo of Carrie Fisher and family in Canada. Meg Ryan And in addition to your romantic comedy, you’re working on a sitcom with Lorne Michaels? It’s not really a sitcom. I can’t believe NBC might do it, because it’s so odd. Right now I’d be producing. Maybe I’ll act in it. I don’t know. It’s a limited series, three seasons. A murder mystery. A comedy. A murder-mystery comedy. You’re O.K. now with being understood by the public as a comedy star? Yeah, I appreciate that there are movies that I watch that make me feel comforted. I can watch a Nancy Meyers movie and feel, God, I love that kitchen. There are certain Coen brothers movies that I like — The Coen brothers’ movies make you feel comforted? “Fargo.” Oh, yeah, I feel good after I watch “Fargo.” “Barton Fink,” too. Barton Fink ends up in hell! But there’s something about how good the Coens are as storytellers. They’re so smart, those guys. Anyway, I know that people say, “I watched ‘Sleepless in Seattle’ over and over when I was recovering from my hip operation.” That’s nice. Movies have funny places in people’s lives.
0~Inside Decades of Nepotism and Bungling at the N.Y.C. Elections Board~It is also the first presidential election in New York with early voting, which began Saturday with tens of thousands of residents flooding polling places. “I expect the B.O.E. to pull this off — there’s no other option. It’s the most important election of our lifetime,” said Scott Stringer, the city comptroller. “But we shouldn’t have to hold our breath because of their gross incompetence.” New York is the only state in the country with local election boards whose staffers are chosen almost entirely by Democratic and Republican Party bosses, and the board in New York City illustrates the pitfalls. In recent years, the board has made increasingly high-profile blunders, from mistakenly purging 200,000 people from rolls ahead of the 2016 election to forcing some voters to wait in four-hour lines in 2018. “It is really hard to have co-workers who are incapable of performing what they need to do,” said Charles Stimson, a trainer assistant who has worked at the board on and off since 1992. Mr. Stimson was one of more than a dozen current and former employees who told The Times that the agency has a culture where ineptitude is common and accountability is rare. Some staffers read or watch Netflix at the office, the employees said. Others regularly fail to show up for work, with no fear of discipline. Several employees said some staffers punch in and then leave to go shopping or to the gym.
0~E.P.A. to Review Attacks on Science Under Trump~Michal Freedhoff, the E.P.A.’s new acting assistant administrator in the office of chemical safety, agreed in a recent interview that disagreements over how science should inform policy are common in every administration. But, Ms. Freedhoff said, what she discovered shortly after she joined the agency in January went well beyond that, and beyond what she was expecting to find. She said she has had briefings and meetings in which scientists have hesitated to explain how and why certain decisions were made during the Trump years, only to learn of multiple instances in which the researchers were told to disregard data or certain studies or were shut out of decision-making altogether. Ms. Freedhoff also said career scientists and other employees had been forced to spend an “inordinate” amount of time helping politically connected companies obtain favorable classifications for their products. The E.P.A. declined to specify the companies involved or their political connections, saying that some of the decisions were under review. But officials said one decision related to the claims that a small company could make for its pesticide. That involved at least three meetings with Trump administration appointees — unusual for what should be a routine staff-level decision. In another instance, Biden administration officials said, career scientists were required to spend a significant amount of time helping a company that wanted to have its product classified in a way that required less E.P.A. oversight. “The involvement and the direction that the career staff were being given really crossed a line,” Ms. Freedhoff said. Those smaller interventions, which she said she discovered only after taking her post, led her to write a March 10 memo to her staff outlining some of the more high-profile scientific integrity violations that had been made, she said. The memo urged employees to speak out “without fear of either retaliation or being denigrated” if they had scientific opinions that did not align with the new administration’s decisions.
0~Voters’ View of a Donald Trump Presidency: Big Risks and Rewards~Most voters consider Donald J. Trump a risky choice for president, saying he lacks the right temperament and values, but he is seen as more transformative and better at handling the economy than Hillary Clinton, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. Mrs. Clinton, despite being as disliked as Mr. Trump, is seen as a safer option. Majorities of voters say she has the temperament for the job and would better handle foreign policy. Only 36 percent of them, however, view her as an agent of change. That perception deeply worries some Clinton campaign advisers, who want the race to hinge on Mr. Trump’s character rather than voters’ desire to upend the status quo. With less than eight weeks until Election Day, the two candidates are locked in a close contest in which the challenge from third-party candidates may make a difference. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, compared with 44 percent for Mr. Trump, the Republican; that result includes voters who said they were leaning toward a candidate. Looking more broadly at all registered voters, Mrs. Clinton holds a wider edge, 46 to 41 percent, driven by her support among women, minorities and college graduates. Getting registered but unlikely voters to the polls in November is a large challenge for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign.
0~Thailand Drops All Charges Against Red Bull Heir in Deadly Crash~BANGKOK — The police in Thailand said they had dropped the last remaining charges against a wealthy playboy on Friday, eight years after he struck and killed an officer with his Ferrari and fled the country. The announcement ended a yearslong drama that included the issuance of an international arrest warrant for the heir to one of the country’s most storied companies and largest fortunes and a public outcry over the seemingly separate system of justice for the country’s richest people. Just before dawn on a dark Bangkok street on a September night in 2012, a speeding Ferrari struck and killed a motorcycle police officer. The driver fled the scene, but a trail of leaking engine fluid led the police to his door — and the damaged Ferrari — a short distance away. The police arrested the driver, Vorayuth Yoovidhaya, the grandson of the inventor of the Red Bull energy drink and heir to one of Thailand’s greatest fortunes. The police said at the time that he had been intoxicated and admitted that his car hit the officer, Wichean Glanprasert.
0~Djokovic, After U.S. Open, Says He Is Working on the Mental Side of Tennis~Eight days after his abrupt disqualification from the United States Open for accidentally hitting a line judge with a ball, Novak Djokovic said that he saw the incident as an opportunity to improve the mental side of his game and that he hoped he could be a “wiser” player as a result. “I’m working mentally and emotionally as hard as I am physically, trying to be the best version of myself on the court, off the court,” Djokovic said Monday from Rome, where he will compete in the Italian Open this week. “I understand that I have outbursts and it’s the personality and kind of player that I have always been.” He added: “Obviously I went through ups and downs in my career, managing to control my emotions more or less. But you’re alone out there, it’s a lot of intensity, a lot of pressure, and you have to deal with all of that.” Djokovic spoke with reporters at length Monday for the first time since he was defaulted in the fourth round of the U.S. Open. While behind in the first set against Pablo Carreño Busta, Djokovic hit a ball about 40 feet, from the court toward a back wall, where it hit a line judge in the throat. She collapsed, and Djokovic tried to comfort her. After a lengthy discussion with tournament officials, he was disqualified, upending the men’s singles draw.
0~Cuando el trabajo de mamá es el que debe esperar~Lurie y sus pacientes forman parte de una generación de mujeres profesionales que han reorganizado la vida doméstica, aunque de manera precaria, para dar cabida a una carrera de tiempo completo y la crianza de los hijos. Están enfrentando la crisis justo en medio de los años más intensos de la maternidad y en un momento fundamental para crecer y establecerse en sus trabajos. Ahora pueden hacer las compras a distancia, pero con las escuelas cerradas y las niñeras ausentes, la pandemia las obliga a enfrentar la dolorosa realidad de la dinámica de género mientras el país se encuentra atrapado en casa. Incluso antes de la crisis del coronavirus, las mujeres pasaban alrededor de cuatro horas al día haciendo trabajo no remunerado, como el lavado de la ropa, la compra de alimentos y la limpieza, en comparación con aproximadamente 2,5 horas en el caso de los hombres, según datos de la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económicos. Esa labor ha aumentado de manera exponencial en las últimas semanas, mientras los estadounidenses educan a sus hijos en casa y ayudan a otros miembros mayores de la familia y amigos más vulnerables ante el virus. En entrevistas con más de una decena de mujeres que trabajan como abogadas, escritoras, arquitectas, maestras, enfermeras y administradoras de organizaciones sin fines de lucro, muchas dijeron que se sentían agradecidas de tener algo de ayuda para cuidar a los niños antes de la cuarentena y de poder trabajar desde casa, pero las había sorprendido un poco darse cuenta de que se espera que sean ellas quienes organicen y gestionen todas las necesidades domésticas de su familia, mientras mantienen una carrera profesional de tiempo completo como parte de una pareja con una carrera dual. Después de todo, fue el feminismo de las generaciones anteriores el que declaró: “lo personal es político”. Entonces, el hecho de que la crisis haya golpeado después de apabullantes derrotas políticas de las candidatas presidenciales se suma al incómodo ajuste de cuentas para muchas mujeres demócratas, incluso si habían decidido que el camino más viable para derrotar al presidente Donald Trump era apoyar al candidato restante. Cuando Elizabeth Warren abandonó la contienda presidencial, Gretchen Newsom se sentó en su auto y rompió en llanto. Seis semanas más tarde, Warren respaldó a su otrora rival político Joe Biden, y Newsom está trabajando, cuidando de los hijos y dándoles clase, porque es madre soltera. Y, como directora política del capítulo de San Diego de la Hermandad Internacional de Trabajadores de la Industria Eléctrica, batalla en todo momento para responder las preguntas ansiosas de los miembros del sindicato.
0~The Aftermath of Shootings in Ohio and Texas~[Mr. Trump was also criticized for mistakenly naming Toledo, not Dayton, as the Ohio city where the massacre took place.] After a taxing weekend filled with frayed nerves, anger and tears, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who hail from the states where the attacks were carried out, strongly condemned Republican inaction. Speaking with CNN Monday morning from Dayton, Ohio, where one of the shootings killed nine people, Mr. Ryan demanded that Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, “do something.” “People are getting killed in the streets in America and nobody is acting,” Mr. Ryan said. [Read more about what the 2020 candidates had to say here.] 8chan has gone dark after a networking company cut it off. 8chan, the online message board where a hate-filled, anti-immigrant manifesto was posted minutes before the El Paso shooting, vanished from the internet on Monday and remained offline several hours later, after a San Francisco company decided to stop providing vital network services to the site. The forum went dark at about midnight in California. After the move was announced late Sunday by the company, Cloudflare, 8chan confirmed the change on Twitter and warned that an interruption in the site’s connectivity would probably follow. The screed was posted minutes before the El Paso shooting, and the authorities said Sunday it was written by the suspected gunman. At least three mass shootings this year — including the mosque killings in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the synagogue shooting in Poway, Calif. — have been announced in advance on 8chan, which has become known as a forum for racist views.
0~Nina Stemme Takes On Her Biggest Met Opera Assignment Yet~“When I turned 50, I thought, my voice might be gone,” recalled Ms. Stemme, a deliberate, thoughtful artist who studied business before deciding to sing. “And what would be the most important thing to look back at? A huge career or a family? That answer was easy.” But her long absence also came about partly because the Met was apparently slow to offer her the right parts early on. After she made her Met debut in 2000 singing Senta in Wagner’s “Der Fliegende Holländer,” her only other engagement with the company before this year came in 2010, when she sang the title role in Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos.” Since then, she has sung with other American companies, including in San Francisco, Houston and Washington. Ms. Stemme was diplomatic, noting that the more lyric roles she favored early on were easier for the Met to cast. “There were American singers for that here,” she said. But as her career took off in the heavier Wagner and Strauss repertoire, in which there are never more than a handful of singers capable of doing the roles justice, her absence from New York became conspicuous. The city’s Wagnerites, a passionate, sometimes obsessive lot, began to look on jealously as she sang elsewhere, recalled Nathalie D. Wagner, the president of the Wagner Society of New York. “Everyone has been saying for years that she should have been engaged much sooner for the big roles at the Met,” she said. The society went en masse to Washington last spring to hear her sing Brünnhilde in the Washington National Opera’s “Ring” cycle and held a reception for her in 2012 when she sang Strauss’s “Salome” in concert with the Cleveland Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.
0~Hamas Leader Plays Final Hand: Trying to Lift Group’s Pariah Status~DOHA, Qatar — In the violent flux of the Middle East, Khaled Meshal is one of the great survivors. Down the years other senior figures in Hamas, the Islamist militant group that resists Israel, have died in hotel rooms at the hands of Israeli assassins or been crushed by laser-guided missiles during the wars in Gaza. Mr. Meshal, who spent his career shifting from one Arab capital to another, had his own close scrape: In 1997, a year after he became the leader of Hamas, Israeli spies sprayed poison into his ear on a street in Jordan, sending Mr. Meshal into a coma and setting off an angry diplomatic showdown between Jordan and Israel that ended with the delivery of a lifesaving antidote. Now Mr. Meshal is stepping down as the senior leader, ending a 21-year reign during which Hamas grew into a formidable military force and also joined politics to rule Gaza for the past decade. Yet it has become an international pariah for its attacks on civilians. Mr. Meshal’s parting shot is a new political document, released at a luxury hotel in Doha on Monday, that he is pitching as an attempt to pull Hamas from its isolation by presenting a friendlier face to the world.
0~Inside Amazon: Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace~Many women at Amazon attribute its gender gap — unlike Facebook, Google or Walmart, it does not currently have a single woman on its top leadership team — to its competition-and-elimination system. Several former high-level female executives, and other women participating in a recent internal Amazon online discussion that was shared with The New York Times, said they believed that some of the leadership principles worked to their disadvantage. They said they could lose out in promotions because of intangible criteria like “earn trust” (principle No. 10) or the emphasis on disagreeing with colleagues. Being too forceful, they said, can be particularly hazardous for women in the workplace. Motherhood can also be a liability. Michelle Williamson, a 41-year-old parent of three who helped build Amazon’s restaurant supply business, said her boss, Shahrul Ladue, had told her that raising children would most likely prevent her from success at a higher level because of the long hours required. Mr. Ladue, who confirmed her account, said that Ms. Williamson had been directly competing with younger colleagues with fewer commitments, so he suggested she find a less demanding job at Amazon. (Both he and Ms. Williamson left the company.) He added that he usually worked 85 or more hours a week and rarely took a vacation. When ‘All’ Isn’t Good Enough Molly Jay, an early member of the Kindle team, said she received high ratings for years. But when she began traveling to care for her father, who was suffering from cancer, and cut back working on nights and weekends, her status changed. She was blocked from transferring to a less pressure-filled job, she said, and her boss told her she was “a problem.” As her father was dying, she took unpaid leave to care for him and never returned to Amazon. “When you’re not able to give your absolute all, 80 hours a week, they see it as a major weakness,” she said. A woman who had thyroid cancer was given a low performance rating after she returned from treatment. She says her manager explained that while she was out, her peers were accomplishing a great deal. Another employee who miscarried twins left for a business trip the day after she had surgery. “I’m sorry, the work is still going to need to get done,” she said her boss told her. “From where you are in life, trying to start a family, I don’t know if this is the right place for you.” A woman who had breast cancer was told that she was put on a “performance improvement plan” — Amazon code for “you’re in danger of being fired” — because “difficulties” in her “personal life” had interfered with fulfilling her work goals. Their accounts echoed others from workers who had suffered health crises and felt they had also been judged harshly instead of being given time to recover. A former human resources executive said she was required to put a woman who had recently returned after undergoing serious surgery, and another who had just had a stillborn child, on performance improvement plans, accounts that were corroborated by a co-worker still at Amazon. “What kind of company do we want to be?” the executive recalled asking her bosses.
0~Europeans Accuse Ireland of Giving Apple Illegal Tax Break~In a warning shot to companies shopping for tax deals around the globe, the European Commission publicly accused Ireland on Tuesday of giving illegal subsidies to Apple and cautioned that the country might need to collect back taxes from the company, which outside analysts said could reach into the billions of dollars. These findings, which constitute a preliminary indictment of Apple’s past arrangements with Ireland, come as policy makers in the United States and Europe try to block some of the inventive maneuvers multinationals use to limit taxes in their home countries and reduce their worldwide payments as much as possible. “The light bulb has gone off that trade wars by another name and conducted through the tax system are just as ruinous,” said Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California’s Gould School of Law and a former chief of staff to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. The commission’s 21-page report, which was sent to Ireland in mid-June but released with redactions only on Tuesday, chastises Irish officials for giving Apple unlawful “state aid” that masqueraded as tax breaks. These special deals, it said, created unfair advantages for Ireland over other European Union member countries.
0~India Plans Big Detention Camps for Migrants. Muslims Are Afraid.~NEW DELHI — More than four million people in India, mostly Muslims, are at risk of being declared foreign migrants as the government pushes a hard-line Hindu nationalist agenda that has challenged the country’s pluralist traditions and aims to redefine what it means to be Indian. The hunt for migrants is unfolding in Assam, a poor, hilly state near the borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh. Many of the people whose citizenship is now being questioned were born in India and have enjoyed all the rights of citizens, such as voting in elections. State authorities are rapidly expanding foreigner tribunals and planning to build huge new detention camps. Hundreds of people have been arrested on suspicion of being a foreign migrant — including a Muslim veteran of the Indian Army. Local activists and lawyers say the pain of being left off a preliminary list of citizens and the prospect of being thrown into jail have driven dozens to suicide. But the governing party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not backing down. Instead, it is vowing to bring this campaign to force people to prove they are citizens to other parts of India, part of a far-reaching Hindu nationalist program fueled by Mr. Modi’s sweeping re-election victory in May and his stratospheric popularity.
0~Ostracized by the West, Russia Finds a Partner in Saudi Arabia~As Russia massed troops on its border with Ukraine and invaded the country at the start of the year, Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Company quietly invested more than $600 million in Russia’s three dominant energy companies. Then, over the summer, as the United States, Canada and several European countries cut oil imports from Russia, Saudi Arabia doubled the amount of fuel oil it was buying from Russia for its power plants, freeing up its own crude for export. And, this month, Russia and Saudi Arabia steered the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allied producers to reduce output targets in an effort to prop up global oil prices, which were falling, a decision that should increase the oil profits of both nations. Taken together, the moves represent a distinct Saudi tilt toward Moscow and away from the United States, which it has typically aligned itself with. The Saudi position falls short of an outright political alliance between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, but the two leaders have established an arrangement that benefits both sides.
0~Decades-Old Soviet Studies Hint at Coronavirus Strategy~MOSCOW — To the boys, it was just a sugary treat. To their parents, prominent medical researchers, what happened in their Moscow apartment that day in 1959 was a vital experiment with countless lives at stake — and their own children as guinea pigs. “We formed a kind of line,” Dr. Peter Chumakov, who was 7 at the time, recalled in an interview. Into each waiting mouth, a parent popped a sugar cube laced with weakened poliovirus — an early vaccine against a dreaded disease. “I was eating it from the hands of my mother.” Today, that same vaccine is gaining renewed attention from researchers — including those brothers, who all grew up to be virologists — as a possible weapon against the new coronavirus, based in part on research done by their mother, Dr. Marina Voroshilova. Dr. Voroshilova established that the live polio vaccine had an unexpected benefit that, it turns out, could be relevant to the current pandemic: People who got the vaccine did not become sick with other viral illnesses for a month or so afterward. She took to giving the boys polio vaccine each fall, as protection against flu.
0~The Infamous Sochi Drug-Testing Lab Is Now a Gastro Pub~The only allusions to the building’s dark past are embedded deep within the restaurant’s extensive cocktail menu, where tipplers in the know might notice the B Sample — tequila, sambuca and Tabasco sauce. That is also the name of the supplementary urine sample required in Olympic drug testing. “Is the B Sample yellow?” asked Richard McLaren, who spent much of 2016 investigating what had happened at the Sochi lab. (It is.) “It effectively acknowledges some of the things that went on, but at the same time it trivializes it,” he added. “I get the humor in it.” La Punto has two fashionable dining rooms connected by dank, dimly lit hallways, the very ones Rodchenkov surreptitiously roamed at night while executing the elaborate scheme to swap out dirty samples for clean ones. On Tuesday those hallways echoed with the pulse of dance music. Most diners, even those well versed in the ins and outs of the melodramatic scandal, seemed unaware of the building’s sketchy past.
0~Trump Hosts Fiery Rally on the Heels of a Whirlwind Week~The rally, which had been rescheduled after the deadly Parkland, Fla., shooting last month, capped a frenzied stretch of fund-raising and campaigning on behalf of Mr. Saccone, who is locked in a tight race with the Democratic nominee, Conor Lamb. How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause. Learn more about our process. “He’s an extraordinary person,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Saccone, dismissing Mr. Lamb as “Lamb the Sham.” “The people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lamb, because he’s not going to vote for us.” It was an opening for Mr. Trump not only to try to apply his political sway in the year’s first special election — one being looked at as a bellwether for the November midterm elections — but also to seize the opportunity to promote his new tariffs before a steel-country base of supporters far more receptive than the officials and pundits in Washington. “Steel is back,” he proclaimed more than once. “Aluminum is back.” He also, after receiving some boos upon first mentioning Mr. Kim, the North Korean dictator, said that he thought the North Koreans “want peace.” He said that his unprecedented meeting could go two very different ways: “We may leave fast,” or strike one of history’s greatest deals. While the rally was not specifically advertised as one for Mr. Saccone, a loss by him would mark the third time that Mr. Trump had thrown his political might behind a candidate without success. With his low poll numbers, Republican leaders and the White House are trying to determine how to handle his desire to campaign in the midterms. But he was a hit with the crowd on Saturday. He retreated to fan favorites: reminiscing about his Electoral College victory, and saying that there is a “lot of evil in Washington” and that he is “getting it out.” To cheers and laughter, Mr. Trump hurled some old and new slurs and insults toward his opponents as he complained about his media coverage and perceived Democratic obstruction. He embellished his derisive “Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd” nickname for the “Meet the Press” host by calling him a “sleeping son of a bitch.” He said “Pocahontas” — his name for Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts — would produce bad television ratings if she challenged him in 2020. And he dismissed Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, as a “low-I.Q. individual,” delivering, in a predominantly white region, an insult that to many carries racial undertones.
0~Hong Kong Delays Election, Citing Coronavirus. The Opposition Isn’t Buying It.~Earlier this week, amid reports that the vote might be delayed, Eddie Chu, a pro-democracy legislator running for re-election, said that China’s ruling Communist Party was ordering “a strategic retreat.” They “want to avoid a potential devastating defeat” in the election, he wrote on Twitter. The explanation that Hong Kong must delay the vote because of the pandemic is likely to fall flat among the wider public, said Ma Ngok, an associate professor of political science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “I think it will be seen as a kind of manipulation, that the government is afraid of losing the majority and that is why they postponed the election,” he said. Mrs. Lam denied that the decision had been influenced by political concerns. “It is purely on the basis of protecting the health and safety of the Hong Kong people and to ensure that the elections are held in a fair and open manner,” she said. While Hong Kong has been a world leader in controlling the coronavirus, in recent days it has seen its worst surge of infections yet, with more than 100 new cases reported daily for more than a week. The government has unfurled several new lockdown and social-distancing measures. “We face a dire situation in our fight against the virus,” Mrs. Lam said. Under Hong Kong law, an election can be delayed for up to 14 days if there is a “danger to public health or safety.” But Mrs. Lam postponed the election until Sept. 5, 2021, under emergency powers that allow the chief executive to make any regulations considered to be “desirable in the public interest.” Those powers, which date to the British colonial era, were invoked last year when the government banned the wearing of masks in an effort to stem protests.
0~F.D.A. to Severely Restrict Diabetes Drug Avandia~In explaining why the F.D.A. decided against only adding more warnings to Avandia’s label, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.’s drug center said, “We know that labels are often not read.” It was an extraordinary acknowledgment from a veteran of an agency that for decades relied almost exclusively on label warnings to control drug use. The suspension and restrictions all but ensure that Avandia’s sales  $1.19 billion last year and $3.2 billion as recently as 2006  will plunge as regulatory authorities around the world are bound to follow with similar restrictions. Avandia was once the biggest-selling diabetes drug around the world, but concerns about heart attack risks have already cut sales. There are about 600,000 people currently taking Avandia in the United States, Dr. Hamburg said at a press conference. “I think the numbers will go down very, very significantly with these new requirements.” GlaxoSmithKline responded that “the company continues to believe that Avandia is an important treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes” and is working with the F.D.A. and European regulators “to implement the required actions.” The company promised that it would end Avandia promotions around the world. The restrictions will take months to put in place. Patients now taking Avandia should continue to do so until they can consult their doctors, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the F.D.A.’s principal deputy commissioner. But he said that doctors should now consider switching patients to other medicines. European regulators began their own reassessment of Avandia in July after seeing a study of the drug by F.D.A. medical officers and another by Dr. Nissen in advance of a July F.D.A. advisory meeting. Once each agency learned of the other’s impending and similar decision  both were reached independently, Dr. Hamburg emphasized  they decided to coordinate their announcements. Several consumer groups said that the F.D.A. should have removed Avandia from the market just as the Europeans did. The F.D.A. announced that it had ordered Glaxo to end a controversial study comparing Avandia and Actos, made by Takeda. It also ordered Glaxo to conduct an independent assessment of the Record trial, a landmark study of Avandia’s heart effects that an F.D.A. medical officer found was riddled with what he said were unpardonable errors that seriously biased the trial’s conclusions.
0~Militants and Refugees Return to Syria Under Cease-Fire Deal~BEIRUT, Lebanon — More than 100 buses carrying Syrian militants, their relatives and other refugees crossed from Lebanon into Syria on Wednesday, bound for a province in northern Syria that is largely controlled by jihadists. The transfer was the largest formal repatriation of refugees to Syria since the war there began in 2011, and the lack of oversight by international aid groups raised concerns about the refugees’ welfare. The agreement to bus the militants and refugees to Syria was part of a cease-fire deal between Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed force and political party, and the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda, now known as the Levant Liberation Committee. Last month, Hezbollah launched an offensive to push Qaeda fighters from a mountainous strip of land along the border with Syria near the Lebanese town of Arsal, an area long subjected to spillover from the Syrian war.
0~Judge Denies Bond to Father and Son Charged With Killing Ahmaud Arbery~Bond hearings rarely last longer than a few hours, but prosecutors and defense lawyers introduced a trove of evidence during the public hearings this week that shed new light on the case. Jesse Evans, a prosecutor who is trying the case, read messages on Thursday that he said were written by Travis McMichael, who the authorities have said shot Mr. Arbery. Mr. Evans said he had once used an anti-Asian slur on Facebook and, in a text message to a friend in November 2019, had talked about shooting somebody while using an anti-Black slur and stereotypes. Image An undated photo of Ahmaud Arbery that was provided by his father, Marcus Arbery. Credit... via Reuters Mr. Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, also spoke at the hearing on Thursday, arguing that the men should not be freed on bond. “These men are proud of what they’ve done, and they want to go home because in their selfish minds, they think that they’re the good guys,” she said. “I continue to suffer mentally and emotionally while I wait for justice for my son.” Judge Timothy Walmsley said he had significant concerns about Travis McMichael’s bias and was worried that Gregory McMichael had been willing to “place the law in his own hands” and influence the investigation. The father and son, each wearing a suit and appearing on a video feed from jail, could be seen speaking to each other briefly after the judge’s ruling but their microphone was muted. Mr. Evans had argued that the men should be denied the opportunity for bond because the killing showed they posed a danger to others. The prosecutor also played recordings of phone calls in which the men had suggested that a woman delete her Facebook account and a man not talk to investigators, arguing that they showed that the men may try to obstruct justice. Gregory McMichael is a former police officer and investigator with the local district attorney’s office, ties that some argued may have helped him evade arrest.
0~Now Drawing Viewers: The Election Interview Boris Johnson Won’t Do~LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson has methodically shielded himself from the scrutiny of the news media during Britain’s general election campaign, becoming the latest populist political leader who has tried to bypass journalists and take his message directly to the people. But Mr. Johnson’s refusal to submit to a TV interview with a famously forensic BBC interviewer, Andrew Neil, has blown up as an issue in the final days of his campaign, illustrating not just the similarities but also the differences between Britain and other democracies where the press is under strain. Mr. Neil reacted to the prime minister’s apparent rejection by installing an empty chair in his studio to dramatize his absence, and then lecturing Mr. Johnson about what he all but called an act of cowardice. “The prime minister of our nation will, at times, have to stand up to President Trump, President Putin, President Xi of China,” Mr. Neil said, glowering into the camera on his program Thursday evening. “So it was surely not expecting too much that he spend half an hour standing up to me.”
0~Banking Ties Could Hurt Joe Biden in Race With Populist Overtone~“When you are a senator from a state with a lot of credit-card and financial interests, you have a different constituency than when you are vice president,” said Jared Bernstein, who served as Mr. Biden’s chief economist and economic adviser during his first term as vice president. In that job, Mr. Biden led the Middle Class Task Force, which sponsored the meeting five years ago on consumer protection issues. And prodded by the Obama administration, Congress passed legislation requiring clearer monthly statements and protecting against retroactive interest rate increases, while limiting the fees that banks charge merchants on debit card purchases. A spokesman for Mr. Biden, Stephen Spector, said the vice president’s efforts had “made the administration unparalleled in its support for financial reform and consumer protection.” Mr. Spector cited Mr. Biden’s support for the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, intended to protect consumers from unfair billing practices, and the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 financial overhaul legislation that provided new consumer safeguards and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The extent to which Mr. Biden can share the credit for those bills could be significant in a primary campaign. “He was very much on the team, and back then it was extremely important that not only did we pass these measures, but that they were elevated for all to see,” Mr. Bernstein said. Christopher J. Dodd, a former Democratic senator from Connecticut, said Mr. Biden, as vice president, was not necessarily a central player in the passage process, but had been a “classic progressive Democrat” on economic issues. “As vice president, I certainly cannot think of a single instance that he was hostile,” said Mr. Dodd, a sponsor of the Dodd-Frank Act with Barney Frank, a former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts. Mr. Frank, who was chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, also did not recall Mr. Biden’s playing a significant role behind the scenes — for or against credit-card companies. Still, Mr. Frank said, the Obama administration’s record on financial issues could be a “pretty good defense for Joe” against criticism of his earlier ties to the credit-card industry, before he was freed from representing the interests of his home state.
0~The Enduring Power of Otis Redding’s ‘Dock of the Bay’~A posthumous pop hit collapses triumph and sorrow into a single song. Only a handful of performers have reached No. 1 with a single after their deaths, including John Lennon, Janis Joplin and the Notorious B.I.G. But the first person to do it was the soul singer Otis Redding, who died in a plane crash in late 1967 at 26 and topped the charts for four weeks the following March and April with a beautifully melancholy song, “(Sittin’ on) The Dock of the Bay.” The song ranked as the sixth-most-played composition on American radio and television in the 20th century. It has gone triple platinum and been covered by artists from Cher to Bob Dylan. Rolling Stone named it No. 26 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. To celebrate its endurance across 50 years, the Otis Redding Foundation is organizing a benefit concert on Thursday at the Apollo Theater, hosted by Whoopi Goldberg and featuring a lineup including Warren Haynes, Aloe Blacc and Booker T. Jones. The Dap-Kings and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band will provide the backup. Paul Janeway of St. Paul and the Broken Bones is scheduled to perform “Down in the Valley” and “I’ve Been Loving You Too Long” at the event. He said that before his band had any original material, it performed complete albums by Redding. The lesson: “As a singer, range is great, but you got to learn to sing the right notes the right way. Otis was one of the masters of that — he was so emotive.” And the reason behind the success of “Dock of the Bay”? “It sounds like the title,” Mr. Janeway said.
0~Armed With Smartphones, Russians Expose Political Abuses~MOSCOW — When a small-town mayor from Russia’s governing party recently offered tens of thousands of dollars in government cash to a veterans group in exchange for votes in next month’s parliamentary elections, it appeared to be business as usual. Violations of Russia’s election rules no longer evoke much surprise here, and in the past the episode would have probably gone unnoticed, or at least unpunished. But this is the era of the smartphone. Someone recorded the mayor’s speech and uploaded the video to YouTube. Along with the promise of cash was a threat to cut off the elderly veterans if they failed to vote for the party, United Russia, which is led by Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin. “If people don’t support the party that is actually doing something, what’s the point of financing them?” the mayor, Denis V. Agashin, asked veterans at a gathering in the town of Izhevsk, according to the video. “If this is the case, it’s clear the people don’t need anything.”
0~Tax the Ultrarich? Cuomo Resists, Even With a $14 Billion Budget Gap~For years, progressive Democrats in Albany have been pushing a three-word solution to many of New York’s problems: Tax the rich. Yet year after year, proposals to make the wealthy pay more were blocked by Republicans. Now, however, their most staunch opponent may well be the state’s third-term governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, a socially progressive Democrat who often boasts of his history of tax cuts. That approach appeals to most taxpayers, and is easier to understand during a decade of financial growth. But as the coronavirus pandemic has transformed New York’s financial problems from merely troubling to catastrophic, a growing contingent of Democrats in the all-blue Legislature is pushing the governor to reconsider his stance. They say the state must increase taxes on the wealthy to safeguard services for New York’s neediest, which could be decimated if the state were forced to make broad cuts because of the looming deficit.
0~Emboldened China Wields Its Laws to Silence Critics From Abroad~BEIJING — On the morning he disappeared, the activist Lee Ming-cheh crossed from Macau into mainland China to meet with democracy advocates. It was 177 days later when he reappeared in public, standing in the dock of a courtroom in central China last week, confessing to a conspiracy to subvert the Communist Party by circulating criticism on social media. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Lee’s detainment remain murky, but what has made the case stand out from the many that the Chinese government brings against its critics is that Mr. Lee is not a citizen of China, but rather of Taiwan, the self-governing island over which Beijing claims sovereignty. The proceedings against Mr. Lee, who is expected to be sentenced as soon as this week, punctuated what critics have warned are China’s brazen efforts to extend the reach of its security forces to stifle what it perceives as threats to its power emanating from overseas.
0~‘Matriarch’ Review: Maternal Instincts~“Matriarch” opens by watching a nude figure descend into a pond of black muck, but the slog that follows in this derivative, tar-flow-paced thriller from Britain is strictly for the viewer. After a title card, the movie introduces its protagonist, Laura (Jemima Rooper), who works in advertising. The director, Ben Steiner, spends nearly a quarter of the running time cataloging ways she is troubled. Laura struggles with drug and alcohol abuse, with apparent bulimia and with staying out of others’ parenting. She chastises a stranger for not feeding a baby quickly enough and tells off her concerned boss (Franc Ashman) by invoking the boss’s dead daughter.
0~F.D.A. Asks If Faulty Blood Monitor Tainted Xarelto Approval~The Food and Drug Administration is investigating whether a faulty blood-testing device may have compromised the results of a clinical trial that led to the approval of Xarelto, a blockbuster anticlotting drug that has been prescribed to millions of Americans since it arrived on the market in 2011. The agency has asked the drug’s manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, detailed questions about whether there was evidence that the device was malfunctioning while the trial was underway, according to a legal brief filed in federal court on Monday by lawyers for patients and their families who say they were injured by the drug. The lawyers also cited internal company documents that they said showed doctors were complaining to the trial leadership during the course of the study. The clinical trial, known as Rocket AF, was led by Dr. Robert M. Califf, currently President Obama’s nominee for head of the Food and Drug Administration. It involved more than 14,000 patients worldwide and took place from 2006 to 2010. Xarelto, which is also known by its scientific name, rivaroxaban, is one of a new class of drugs that are seen as a replacement for warfarin, a cumbersome 60-year-old drug used to prevent strokes in people with a heart-rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation. Warfarin requires careful monitoring of a patient’s diet and drug regimen, and frequent blood tests to ensure that is working. If patients receive too little of the drug, they could experience a stroke. But if they receive too much, their lives could be threatened by catastrophic bleeding.
0~Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Sues Mail on Sunday Over Publication of Letter~LONDON — Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has filed a lawsuit against a British tabloid and its parent company over the publication of a private letter, her husband, Prince Harry, said on Tuesday, in an unusually public rebuke of the British press by the royal family. Despite Buckingham Palace’s long and sometimes acrimonious relationship with Britain’s raucous tabloids, the royal family has rarely challenged specific publications or articles in public. But in a statement posted on the duke and duchess’s website, Prince Harry said that Meghan had become a victim of “a ruthless campaign” by British tabloids, and that he had been “a silent witness to her private suffering for too long.” The statement does not identify what article prompted the lawsuit, against The Mail on Sunday, but in February the tabloid published a story about a handwritten letter that Meghan had sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle.
0~U.N. Panel Says North Korean Leader Could Face Trial~GENEVA — A United Nations panel has served notice to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, that he may be personally held liable in court for crimes against humanity committed by state institutions and officials under his direct control. A letter conveying this notice is part of a report by the panel to the United Nations Human Rights Council, released Monday after a yearlong investigation. The report is viewed by rights activists not only as the most detailed and authoritative body of data on the state of human rights in North Korea, but also as a milestone in the international debate on one of the world’s most reclusive and isolated countries. In the letter, dated Jan. 20, the panel chairman, the retired Australian judge Michael Donald Kirby, summarized the investigation’s findings of crimes against humanity committed by officials that could be inferred to be acting under Mr. Kim’s personal control.
0~N.Y.U. in Abu Dhabi: A Sectarian Bargain~For two years, various university administrators promised to resolve my case. But the process always stalled, and I was told it was out of their hands. I will probably never know exactly what happened, but I suspect that N.Y.U. administrators in Abu Dhabi did not want to expend limited political capital with their Emirati partners on my case, or the “Shiite problem” in general. The government of Abu Dhabi, whose security apparatus denied my security clearance most likely for sectarian reasons, has funded the planning and construction of the N.Y.U. campus and its operational expenses. At least one other tenured N.Y.U. professor, also a United States citizen of Shiite origin, was recently denied a security clearance to teach at the Abu Dhabi campus. This is precisely what the university’s leadership promised would not happen when it made the deal to open a branch in the capital of an authoritarian state. The university started its partnership with Abu Dhabi at a time when — awash in record oil revenues in the mid-2000s — the emirate’s leaders, especially the crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Zayed, had set out to buy social and cultural legitimacy. Abu Dhabi funded literary festivals and prizes, translation projects and branches of pre-eminent museums and universities. But the Arab Spring uprisings rattled the U.A.E. leaders’ confidence in their own ability to stay in power, and a repressive turn prioritizing security over cultural capital followed. In March 2011, as the popular revolts spread through the region, more than 100 activists in the U.A.E. signed a petition calling for direct elections and reform of the country’s toothless Parliament. Many of those who signed the document were prosecuted, stripped of their citizenship or subsequently deported. Academics also came under assault. In the summer of 2012, Matt Duffy, a journalism professor at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, was abruptly fired and forced to leave the U.A.E. after he criticized media restrictions in the country. In March 2015, Andrew Ross, an N.Y.U. professor who specializes in labor issues, was barred from traveling to Abu Dhabi for unspecified security reasons. Mr. Ross, who was an outspoken critic of the university’s Abu Dhabi project and especially the abuse of migrant laborers in the emirates, had planned to spend his spring break researching labor conditions. The university’s response was tepid and cowardly. A spokesman argued that “it is the government that controls visa and immigration policy, and not the university.”
0~Rick Perry’s Plan to Rescue Struggling Coal and Nuclear Plants Is Rejected~WASHINGTON — Federal regulators on Monday rejected a proposal by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants, in a major blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to revive America’s declining coal industry. Over the past decade, an influx of cheap natural gas and the rapid rise of renewable energy have transformed the nation’s power sector, driving down wholesale electricity prices and pushing many older coal and nuclear plants into unprofitability and retirement. In September, Mr. Perry warned that the loss of these plants could threaten the “reliability and resiliency of our nation’s grid” and asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees regional electricity markets, to guarantee financial returns for power plants that can stockpile at least 90 days’ worth of fuel on-site — which, in effect, meant propping up uncompetitive coal and nuclear units. (Natural gas plants are typically fed by pipeline and would not qualify.) While a few utilities with significant coal and nuclear capacity supported the idea, Mr. Perry’s proposal generated a fierce backlash from a broad coalition of energy companies, free-market groups and former regulators.
0~Finding ‘My Most Authentic Self’: What L.G.B.T. Spaces Mean to You~Safety. Family. Home. After the attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, The New York Times asked readers what L.G.B.T.-friendly spaces meant to them. One of those three words, or some variation, came up in almost every response. For many who responded, gay bars, community centers and nightclubs are their only true space of inclusion. They are venues where they can exchange glances and flirt without fear, where they can talk about attraction without stigma or reproach, and where same-sex couples can touch and kiss without worrying who might be watching. The responses illustrate the role these places play in the lives of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Here is a sampling of replies, which have been condensed and edited.
0~New York City Booster Shot Data Shows Major Racial Disparities~Much like the rest of the United States, New York City has struggled to convince some groups of residents to get a booster shot of the coronavirus vaccine. But new data released by the city on Wednesday shows wide disparities among who in the city is getting a third dose. Though millions of Americans flocked to get fully vaccinated, the number of people getting a booster shot has come up short. New York City now has the data to exemplify this: While 77 percent of all city residents have received either the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot or two doses of the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, only about 36 percent had received a booster shot as of Friday. When looking at adults 18 and older, just 43 percent had gotten a booster. The rate was even lower for eligible children, ages 13 to 17: 21 percent. The numbers also highlighted further inequalities by neighborhood and race. Almost half of Manhattan had been boosted, compared with just over a quarter of the Bronx.
0~Disney Buys Maker Studios, Video Supplier for YouTube~LOS ANGELES — Mickey Mouse became a YouTube giant on Monday. The Walt Disney Company said it had completed a deal to pay $500 million to acquire Maker Studios, a YouTube-based video supplier that generates more than 5.5 billion views a month from a subscriber base of 380 million. The purchase, by far the largest for what Hollywood calls a multichannel network, calls for Disney to pay another $450 million if aggressive growth targets are met. “Maker already has a very large audience that will only keep growing, and that is something that would be hard to build on our own,” said Kevin A. Mayer, Disney’s executive vice president for corporate strategy and business development. Most of Disney’s recent acquisitions have been about amassing intellectual property to fuel its television, theme park, consumer products and movie divisions — buying Lucasfilm, home to the “Star Wars” franchise, and Marvel Entertainment. There is an element of that with Maker, which runs popular YouTube channels like PewDiePie, starring a Swedish comedian and video game enthusiast, and Epic Rap Battles of History, focused on comedic pairings of historical and pop culture figures. But mostly the deal is about distribution and programming expertise. Maker manages roughly 55,000 YouTube channels, most of which provide a pipeline to young consumers for Disney’s characters and franchises. Disney is also counting on Maker to help it learn how to best interact with the raised-on-the-Web generation.
0~Suffolk and Nassau Tested by Fiscal Crisis Demand Tough Measures~“Things are as bad as they can be,” he said. After cutting fat in prior years, “today we must cut the heart out of county government.” And Mr. Suozzi replaced the old slogan of “doing more with less” with a new mantra, to “do less with less.” In an interview, he said: “We need help so we don’t have to do all this terrible stuff. I don’t want to do any of this stuff.” The Suffolk County executive, Steve Levy, was also grim. The fiscal crisis dominated his State of the County address at the end of last month, in which he lamented “an economic climate not seen on Long Island in the last 80 years,” since the Great Depression. “Many of the options are going to be ugly,” Mr. Levy said in an interview. He ordered a freeze in discretionary spending to save $40 million. He is exploring other measures with county legislators, including privatizing the county nursing home, the John J. Foley Skilled Nursing Facility in Yaphank, a plan they have resisted. Some legislators have suggested suspending the sacrosanct open-space preservation program. Both county executives said they oppose raising property taxes as a solution. Each county’s budget is about $2.6 billion. Nassau estimates its budget gap at $130 million. Suffolk has not specified its potential gap, but the number is expected to be similar. County finances have hit bumps before, like the aftermath of the 2001 World Trade Center attacks, but they were nothing like this crisis.
0~China Raises Death Toll in Ethnic Clashes to 184~URUMQI, China  The death toll from the ethnic violence in this regional capital rose to 184, with the vast majority of dead from the majority Han ethnic group, the government announced through the state news media on Friday. Earlier in the day, the authorities banned Friday Prayer at most mosques here to quell further unrest by Uighurs. Friday was the first time that the government had given an ethnic breakdown of the dead. According to Xinhua, the state news agency, 137 of those killed were Han, 46 were Uighur and 1 was from the Hui ethnic group. Image Security forces block the entrance to a mosque before Friday prayers in the city of Urumqi, China. Credit... David Gray/Reuters For much of the past week, the official death toll from the initial rioting last Sunday was put at 156, and Uighurs and Han had both claimed that the toll was much higher, and that deaths from each of their groups predominated. Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim race that is the largest ethnic group in this western region of Xinjiang, while Han make up about 90 percent of the Chinese population and are the majority in this city of 2.3 million.
0~Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They’re Not Keeping It Secret~Dozens of companies use smartphone locations to help advertisers and even hedge funds. They say it’s anonymous, but the data shows how personal it is. The millions of dots on the map trace highways, side streets and bike trails — each one following the path of an anonymous cellphone user. One path tracks someone from a home outside Newark to a nearby Planned Parenthood, remaining there for more than an hour. Another represents a person who travels with the mayor of New York during the day and returns to Long Island at night. Yet another leaves a house in upstate New York at 7 a.m. and travels to a middle school 14 miles away, staying until late afternoon each school day. Only one person makes that trip: Lisa Magrin, a 46-year-old math teacher. Her smartphone goes with her. An app on the device gathered her location information, which was then sold without her knowledge. It recorded her whereabouts as often as every two seconds, according to a database of more than a million phones in the New York area that was reviewed by The New York Times. While Ms. Magrin’s identity was not disclosed in those records, The Times was able to easily connect her to that dot. The app tracked her as she went to a Weight Watchers meeting and to her dermatologist’s office for a minor procedure. It followed her hiking with her dog and staying at her ex-boyfriend’s home, information she found disturbing. “It’s the thought of people finding out those intimate details that you don’t want people to know,” said Ms. Magrin, who allowed The Times to review her location data. Like many consumers, Ms. Magrin knew that apps could track people’s movements. But as smartphones have become ubiquitous and technology more accurate, an industry of snooping on people’s daily habits has spread and grown more intrusive. intro By Michael H. Keller and Richard Harris | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobe At least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information, The Times found. Several of those businesses claim to track up to 200 million mobile devices in the United States — about half those in use last year. The database reviewed by The Times — a sample of information gathered in 2017 and held by one company — reveals people’s travels in startling detail, accurate to within a few yards and in some cases updated more than 14,000 times a day. [Learn how to stop apps from tracking your location.] These companies sell, use or analyze the data to cater to advertisers, retail outlets and even hedge funds seeking insights into consumer behavior. It’s a hot market, with sales of location-targeted advertising reaching an estimated $21 billion this year. IBM has gotten into the industry, with its purchase of the Weather Channel’s apps. The social network Foursquare remade itself as a location marketing company. Prominent investors in location start-ups include Goldman Sachs and Peter Thiel, the PayPal co-founder. Businesses say their interest is in the patterns, not the identities, that the data reveals about consumers. They note that the information apps collect is tied not to someone’s name or phone number but to a unique ID. But those with access to the raw data — including employees or clients — could still identify a person without consent. They could follow someone they knew, by pinpointing a phone that regularly spent time at that person’s home address. Or, working in reverse, they could attach a name to an anonymous dot, by seeing where the device spent nights and using public records to figure out who lived there. Many location companies say that when phone users enable location services, their data is fair game. But, The Times found, the explanations people see when prompted to give permission are often incomplete or misleading. An app may tell users that granting access to their location will help them get traffic information, but not mention that the data will be shared and sold. That disclosure is often buried in a vague privacy policy. “Location information can reveal some of the most intimate details of a person’s life — whether you’ve visited a psychiatrist, whether you went to an A.A. meeting, who you might date,” said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who has proposed bills to limit the collection and sale of such data, which are largely unregulated in the United States. “It’s not right to have consumers kept in the dark about how their data is sold and shared and then leave them unable to do anything about it,” he added. Mobile Surveillance Devices After Elise Lee, a nurse in Manhattan, saw that her device had been tracked to the main operating room at the hospital where she works, she expressed concern about her privacy and that of her patients. “It’s very scary,” said Ms. Lee, who allowed The Times to examine her location history in the data set it reviewed. “It feels like someone is following me, personally.” The mobile location industry began as a way to customize apps and target ads for nearby businesses, but it has morphed into a data collection and analysis machine. Retailers look to tracking companies to tell them about their own customers and their competitors’. For a web seminar last year, Elina Greenstein, an executive at the location company GroundTruth, mapped out the path of a hypothetical consumer from home to work to show potential clients how tracking could reveal a person’s preferences. For example, someone may search online for healthy recipes, but GroundTruth can see that the person often eats at fast-food restaurants. “We look to understand who a person is, based on where they’ve been and where they’re going, in order to influence what they’re going to do next,” Ms. Greenstein said. Financial firms can use the information to make investment decisions before a company reports earnings — seeing, for example, if more people are working on a factory floor, or going to a retailer’s stores. planned parenthood By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google Earth Health care facilities are among the more enticing but troubling areas for tracking, as Ms. Lee’s reaction demonstrated. Tell All Digital, a Long Island advertising firm that is a client of a location company, says it runs ad campaigns for personal injury lawyers targeting people anonymously in emergency rooms. “The book ‘1984,’ we’re kind of living it in a lot of ways,” said Bill Kakis, a managing partner at Tell All. Jails, schools, a military base and a nuclear power plant — even crime scenes — appeared in the data set The Times reviewed. One person, perhaps a detective, arrived at the site of a late-night homicide in Manhattan, then spent time at a nearby hospital, returning repeatedly to the local police station. Two location firms, Fysical and SafeGraph, mapped people attending the 2017 presidential inauguration. On Fysical’s map, a bright red box near the Capitol steps indicated the general location of President Trump and those around him, cellphones pinging away. Fysical’s chief executive said in an email that the data it used was anonymous. SafeGraph did not respond to requests for comment. school By Michael H. Keller | Imagery by Google Earth More than 1,000 popular apps contain location-sharing code from such companies, according to 2018 data from MightySignal, a mobile analysis firm. Google’s Android system was found to have about 1,200 apps with such code, compared with about 200 on Apple’s iOS. The most prolific company was Reveal Mobile, based in North Carolina, which had location-gathering code in more than 500 apps, including many that provide local news. A Reveal spokesman said that the popularity of its code showed that it helped app developers make ad money and consumers get free services. To evaluate location-sharing practices, The Times tested 20 apps, most of which had been flagged by researchers and industry insiders as potentially sharing the data. Together, 17 of the apps sent exact latitude and longitude to about 70 businesses. Precise location data from one app, WeatherBug on iOS, was received by 40 companies. When contacted by The Times, some of the companies that received that data described it as “unsolicited” or “inappropriate.” WeatherBug, owned by GroundTruth, asks users’ permission to collect their location and tells them the information will be used to personalize ads. GroundTruth said that it typically sent the data to ad companies it worked with, but that if they didn’t want the information they could ask to stop receiving it. mayor By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobe The Times also identified more than 25 other companies that have said in marketing materials or interviews that they sell location data or services, including targeted advertising. [Read more about how The Times analyzed location tracking companies.] The spread of this information raises questions about how securely it is handled and whether it is vulnerable to hacking, said Serge Egelman, a computer security and privacy researcher affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley. “There are really no consequences” for companies that don’t protect the data, he said, “other than bad press that gets forgotten about.” A Question of Awareness Companies that use location data say that people agree to share their information in exchange for customized services, rewards and discounts. Ms. Magrin, the teacher, noted that she liked that tracking technology let her record her jogging routes. Brian Wong, chief executive of Kiip, a mobile ad firm that has also sold anonymous data from some of the apps it works with, says users give apps permission to use and share their data. “You are receiving these services for free because advertisers are helping monetize and pay for it,” he said, adding, “You would have to be pretty oblivious if you are not aware that this is going on.” But Ms. Lee, the nurse, had a different view. “I guess that’s what they have to tell themselves,” she said of the companies. “But come on.” Ms. Lee had given apps on her iPhone access to her location only for certain purposes — helping her find parking spaces, sending her weather alerts — and only if they did not indicate that the information would be used for anything else, she said. Ms. Magrin had allowed about a dozen apps on her Android phone access to her whereabouts for services like traffic notifications. An app on Lisa Magrin’s cellphone collected her location information, which was then shared with other companies. The data revealed her daily habits, including hikes with her dog, Lulu. Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times But it is easy to share information without realizing it. Of the 17 apps that The Times saw sending precise location data, just three on iOS and one on Android told users in a prompt during the permission process that the information could be used for advertising. Only one app, GasBuddy, which identifies nearby gas stations, indicated that data could also be shared to “analyze industry trends.” More typical was theScore, a sports app: When prompting users to grant access to their location, it said the data would help “recommend local teams and players that are relevant to you.” The app passed precise coordinates to 16 advertising and location companies. A spokesman for theScore said that the language in the prompt was intended only as a “quick introduction to certain key product features” and that the full uses of the data were described in the app’s privacy policy. The Weather Channel app, owned by an IBM subsidiary, told users that sharing their locations would let them get personalized local weather reports. IBM said the subsidiary, the Weather Company, discussed other uses in its privacy policy and in a separate “privacy settings” section of the app. Information on advertising was included there, but a part of the app called “location settings” made no mention of it. A notice that Android users saw when theScore, a sports app, asked for access to their location data. The Weather Channel app showed iPhone users this message when it first asked for their location data. The app did not explicitly disclose that the company had also analyzed the data for hedge funds — a pilot program that was promoted on the company’s website. An IBM spokesman said the pilot had ended. (IBM updated the app’s privacy policy on Dec. 5, after queries from The Times, to say that it might share aggregated location data for commercial purposes such as analyzing foot traffic.) Even industry insiders acknowledge that many people either don’t read those policies or may not fully understand their opaque language. Policies for apps that funnel location information to help investment firms, for instance, have said the data is used for market analysis, or simply shared for business purposes. “Most people don’t know what’s going on,” said Emmett Kilduff, the chief executive of Eagle Alpha, which sells data to financial firms and hedge funds. Mr. Kilduff said responsibility for complying with data-gathering regulations fell to the companies that collected it from people. Many location companies say they voluntarily take steps to protect users’ privacy, but policies vary widely. For example, Sense360, which focuses on the restaurant industry, says it scrambles data within a 1,000-foot square around the device’s approximate home location. Another company, Factual, says that it collects data from consumers at home, but that its database doesn’t contain their addresses. diptych By Michael H. Keller | Satellite imagery by Mapbox and DigitalGlobe Some companies say they delete the location data after using it to serve ads, some use it for ads and pass it along to data aggregation companies, and others keep the information for years. Several people in the location business said that it would be relatively simple to figure out individual identities in this kind of data, but that they didn’t do it. Others suggested it would require so much effort that hackers wouldn’t bother. It “would take an enormous amount of resources,” said Bill Daddi, a spokesman for Cuebiq, which analyzes anonymous location data to help retailers and others, and raised more than $27 million this year from investors including Goldman Sachs and Nasdaq Ventures. Nevertheless, Cuebiq encrypts its information, logs employee queries and sells aggregated analysis, he said. There is no federal law limiting the collection or use of such data. Still, apps that ask for access to users’ locations, prompting them for permission while leaving out important details about how the data will be used, may run afoul of federal rules on deceptive business practices, said Maneesha Mithal, a privacy official at the Federal Trade Commission. “You can’t cure a misleading just-in-time disclosure with information in a privacy policy,” Ms. Mithal said. Following the Money Apps form the backbone of this new location data economy. The app developers can make money by directly selling their data, or by sharing it for location-based ads, which command a premium. Location data companies pay half a cent to two cents per user per month, according to offer letters to app makers reviewed by The Times. Targeted advertising is by far the most common use of the information. Google and Facebook, which dominate the mobile ad market, also lead in location-based advertising. Both companies collect the data from their own apps. They say they don’t sell it but keep it for themselves to personalize their services, sell targeted ads across the internet and track whether the ads lead to sales at brick-and-mortar stores. Google, which also receives precise location information from apps that use its ad services, said it modified that data to make it less exact. Smaller companies compete for the rest of the market, including by selling data and analysis to financial institutions. This segment of the industry is small but growing, expected to reach about $250 million a year by 2020, according to the market research firm Opimas. Apple and Google have a financial interest in keeping developers happy, but both have taken steps to limit location data collection. In the most recent version of Android, apps that are not in use can collect locations “a few times an hour,” instead of continuously. Apple has been stricter, for example requiring apps to justify collecting location details in pop-up messages. But Apple’s instructions for writing these pop-ups do not mention advertising or data sale, only features like getting “estimated travel times.” A spokesman said the company mandates that developers use the data only to provide a service directly relevant to the app, or to serve advertising that met Apple’s guidelines. Apple recently shelved plans that industry insiders say would have significantly curtailed location collection. Last year, the company said an upcoming version of iOS would show a blue bar onscreen whenever an app not in use was gaining access to location data. The discussion served as a “warning shot” to people in the location industry, David Shim, chief executive of the location company Placed, said at an industry event last year. After examining maps showing the locations extracted by their apps, Ms. Lee, the nurse, and Ms. Magrin, the teacher, immediately limited what data those apps could get. Ms. Lee said she told the other operating-room nurses to do the same. “I went through all their phones and just told them: ‘You have to turn this off. You have to delete this,’” Ms. Lee said. “Nobody knew.”
0~U.S. to Stop Deporting Some Immigrants~Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children will be allowed to remain in the country without fear of deportation and able to work, under an executive action the Obama administration announced on Friday. Administration officials said the president used existing legal authority to make the broad policy change, which could temporarily benefit more than 800,000 young people. He did not consult with Congress, where Republicans have generally opposed measures to benefit illegal immigrants. The policy, while not granting any permanent legal status, clears the way for young illegal immigrants to come out of the shadows, work legally and obtain driver’s licenses and many other documents they have lacked. “They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper,” President Obama said in announcing the new policy in the White House Rose Garden on Friday. He said he was taking “a temporary stopgap measure” that would “lift the shadow of deportation from these young people” and make immigration policy “more fair, more efficient and more just.”

0~E.P.A. Cancels Talk on Climate Change by Agency Scientists~The move highlights widespread concern that the E.P.A. will silence government scientists from speaking publicly or conducting work on climate change. Scott Pruitt, the agency administrator, has said that he does not believe human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are primarily responsible for the warming of the planet. “It’s definitely a blatant example of the scientific censorship we all suspected was going to start being enforced at E.P.A.,” said John King, a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island who chairs the science advisory committee of the Narragansett Bay Estuary Program. “They don’t believe in climate change, so I think what they’re trying to do is stifle discussions of the impacts of climate change.” Monday’s conference is designed to draw attention to the health of Narragansett Bay, the largest estuary in New England and a key to the region’s tourism and fishing industries. Rhode Island’s entire congressional delegation, all Democrats, will attend a morning news conference. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, an outspoken critic of Mr. Pruitt, will be among the speakers. Understand the Latest News on Climate Change Card 1 of 5 Shifting patterns. The melting of the snowpack in the high Cascades has long been a source of sustenance in the Pacific Northwest. But as climate change makes seasons less predictable and precipitation more variable, people there are reimagining the region’s future and the tools that will be needed to manage it. Facing drought. The story of the Netherlands’ long struggles against excess water is written all over its boggy landscape. Now that climate change is drying it out, the Dutch are hoping to engineer once again their way to safety — only this time, by figuring out how to hold onto water instead of flushing it out. A more extreme monsoon. South Asia’s annual monsoon is inextricably linked, culturally and economically, to much of Asia, bringing life-giving water to nearly one-quarter of the world’s population. But climate change is making the monsoon more erratic, less dependable and even dangerous, with more violent rainfall as well as worsening dry spells. Wildfire smoke pollution. Smoke from wildfires has worsened over the past decade, potentially reversing decades of improvements in Western air quality made under the Clean Air Act, according to new research. Some areas in the Western United States had increases in particulate pollution from smoke that were about the same amount as the improvements in air quality from regulating factories and other sources of pollution. Relinquishing a fortune. Yvon Chouinard, the founder of the outdoor apparel maker Patagonia, transferred ownership of his company to a trust and an organization devoted to fighting climate change. The move comes at a moment of growing scrutiny for billionaires whose rhetoric about making the world a better place often don’t match reality. Scientists there will unveil the report on the state of the bay, which E.P.A. scientists helped research and write. Among the findings will be that climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level and fish in and around the estuary. Autumn Oczkowski, a research ecologist at the E.P.A.’s National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Atlantic Ecology Division in Rhode Island, was scheduled to give the keynote address. Colleagues familiar with her speech said she intended to address climate change and other factors affecting the health of the estuary.
0~Oregon City Watches for Clues to Fate of Missing Girls~The people in Oregon City are looking, and they are watching. They are looking for Ashley Marie Pond and Miranda Diane Gaddis, 13-year-old girls who disappeared from the same apartment complex here in recent months. They are watching for the person who may have abducted them, searching for clues in the sketchy psychological portrait that the federal and local authorities released this week. Probably a man, the investigators said. Probably someone who has displayed a high degree of interest in the local media's relentless coverage of the case. He (or possibly she) might have changed appearance recently, perhaps by changing hairstyles or hair color. The person may have appeared extremely tired or sleepy, or missed work, especially on the days the girls disappeared. He may be nervous or irritable. ''It's very generalized, very vague,'' said the Rev. Andy Anquoe, a pastor at the Oregon City Baptist Church. ''It's just very frustrating not to know more, exactly what we're supposed to watch out for.'' It is agonizing for the mothers of the two girls not to know more. They cling to the hope that the girls will be found alive, that they just ran away.
0~Dr. Donald Lindberg, 85, Dies; Opened Medical Research to the World~Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg, who as director of the National Library of Medicine — the world’s largest — computerized its vast holdings and made them accessible to researchers around the world, died on Aug. 17 at a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 85. His wife, Mary, said the cause was a cerebral hemorrhage sustained after he fell at home on Aug. 12. Dr. Lindberg was a leader in medical informatics, the science of using computer technology to improve human health and the delivery of health care services. As the longtime leader of the library, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, he modernized, expanded and transformed a trove of material, some of which dates to the 12th century. “He changed fundamentally the way biomedical knowledge and health information is collected, organized, and made available for public use — in small villages in Alaska and Mali as well as in laboratories of Nobel prizewinners,” the library’s board of regents said in a resolution when he retired in 2015.

0~With ‘The Water Dancer,’ Ta-Nehisi Coates Makes His Fiction Debut~Over the past decade, Ta-Nehisi Coates has emerged as an important public intellectual and perhaps America’s most incisive thinker about race. In his three books of nonfiction — “The Beautiful Struggle,” “Between the World and Me” and “We Were Eight Years in Power” — he seemed to be almost single-handedly waking the consciousness of his country. With his left hand, Coates also writes comic books, including a Black Panther series for Marvel. When word leaked that he was writing a novel, one had to wonder: What would that be like? The most surprising thing about “The Water Dancer” may be its unambiguous narrative ambition. This isn’t a typical first novel, if by “typical first novel” we mean a minor-chord and semi-autobiographical nibbling expedition around the margins of a life. “The Water Dancer” is a jeroboam of a book, a crowd-pleasing exercise in breakneck and often occult storytelling that tonally resembles the work of Stephen King as much as it does the work of Toni Morrison, Colson Whitehead and the touchstone African-American science-fiction writer Octavia Butler. Set largely on a tobacco plantation in Virginia during the middle of the 19th century, this novel is about one black man’s experience of slavery and the Underground Railroad, and it is flecked with forms of wonder-working that push at the boundaries of what we still seem to be calling magical realism. Coates writes as if he’s thrown his readers into a carriage and is hurtling them through the woods. The ride is bracing, even if one sometimes misses the grainy and intense intellection of his nonfiction writing. In his earlier books each paragraph felt like a bouillon cube that could be used to brew six other essays. Here the effect is more diffuse, and something intangible goes missing. The narrator of “The Water Dancer” is Hiram Walker, a sensitive young black man born into bondage. His mother was sold at auction, and he clings to his scant memories of her. In “Between the World and Me,” which took the form of a letter to his son, Coates observed: “Slavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. It is a particular, specific enslaved woman, whose mind is active as your own, whose range of feeling is as vast as your own.” One of his achievements in this novel is to closely underscore the human particularity of a range of enslaved men and women.
0~As Coronavirus Spreads, Face Mask Makers Go Into Overdrive~Supply shortages could be made worse by the fact that parts for masks and respirators are made in a variety of countries. More than 90 percent of surgical masks sold in the United States are produced overseas, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Parts — or sometimes the final assembly — may be based not only in China and Taiwan but also in Japan, Vietnam, Mexico and Colombia. “These countries could easily cut off our supply chain,” said Laurie Garrett, a policy expert and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who has written about the SARS, Ebola and other outbreaks. With China’s pipeline to the outside world running dry, medical suppliers around the globe, including giants like Honeywell and 3M, are scrambling to find alternative sources. Both companies said through representatives that they were experiencing a surge in demand and were moving to ramp up production wherever they could. Prestige Ameritech, a mask manufacturer in North Richland Hills, Texas, is among companies that received international orders as the coronavirus spread to 24 countries in the last few weeks, including from the governments of Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. “I have thousands of emails from people in Asia,” said Mike Bowen, the executive vice president. “Last week I sent over a million masks to China. That’s one thing I never predicted, that I’d be sending masks to China.”
0~Shareholders Approve Plan to Split News Corp.~News Corporation inched closer toward separating itself into two publicly traded companies on Tuesday, as shareholders approved a plan to sever the company’s publishing assets from its more lucrative entertainment divisions. Shareholders attended a special meeting at the media company’s New York headquarters early Tuesday where they voted in favor of the formation of two separate companies. The larger company, 21st Century Fox, will include Fox Broadcasting, cable channels like Fox News and FX, and the Hollywood studio; a newly formed News Corporation will contain newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post, the HarperCollins publishing company and a handful of Australian television assets. Investors have for years grumbled that many of News Corporation’s more than 120 newspapers were a drag on the company, in contrast to the strong performance of its cable television assets. Those complaints became more pronounced in July 2011 when a phone hacking scandal erupted at the company’s British newspaper division, prompting the chief executive, Rupert Murdoch, to abruptly close News of the World, one of News Corporation’s most profitable papers. “With the split of our company, and the birth of the new News Corp., I have been given the extraordinary opportunity most people never get in their lifetime: the chance to do it all over again,” Mr. Murdoch told investors at a News Corporation investor day held May 28.
0~In Seeking to Hold Michigan, Trump Can Be His Own Worst Enemy~Mr. Trump’s advisers have nudged him to focus on his success in pushing through the renegotiated trade pact with Mexico and Canada, which has benefits for the auto industry and, were he to make it more of an issue, could help him with working-class voters in Michigan. And they are hoping that the presence on the ballot in Michigan this year of John James, an African-American Republican who is running for a U.S. Senate seat, could peel away some black voters from Democrats. Indeed, Mr. Trump’s decision to include Mr. James at an ostensibly nonpolitical round table with black Michiganders at a Ford plant in May angered prominent state Democrats, according to Democratic officials. Michigan, however, offers a vivid illustration of how Mr. Trump can be his own worst political enemy. He delights in headline-grabbing and often menacing attacks but rarely follows through with the punishment he threatens, leaving him looking more like a peanut gallery heckler than a political force to be feared. That was true in the case of the clash in May. Hours after threatening to defund Michigan, Mr. Trump told reporters, “I don’t think it’s going to be necessary” and, speaking to the news media in the state the next day, said he was “not going to discuss” what funds he had in mind.

Similarly, after insulting Ms. Whitmer as “half Whitmer” and “the woman in Michigan” while suggesting to Vice President Mike Pence that he ignore her calls entirely, Mr. Trump himself quietly telephoned her to ensure that a shipment of personal protective equipment had arrived in the state. This pattern of attack-and-retreat instills little fear in his adversaries, reinforces negative perceptions about him among voters (who often only hear of the threats) and hands Democrats fodder for their own reprisals.
0~In Tug of War Over New Fed Leader, Some Gender Undertones~WASHINGTON — President Obama’s choice of a replacement for the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is coming down to a battle between the California girls and the Rubin boys. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s vice chairwoman, is one of three female friends, all former or current professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who have broken into the male-dominated business of advising presidents on economic policy. Her career has been intertwined with those of Christina D. Romer, who led Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers at the beginning of his first term, and Laura D’Andrea Tyson, who held the same job under President Clinton and later served as the director of the White House economic policy committee. But no woman has climbed to the very top of the hierarchy to serve as Fed chairwoman or Treasury secretary. Ms. Yellen’s chief rival for Mr. Bernanke’s job, Lawrence H. Summers, is a member of a close-knit group of men, protégés of the former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who have dominated economic policy-making in both the Clinton and the Obama administrations. Those men, including the former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Gene B. Sperling, the president’s chief economic policy adviser, are said to be quietly pressing Mr. Obama to nominate Mr. Summers. The choice of a Fed chair is perhaps the single most important economic policy decision that Mr. Obama will make in his second term. Mr. Bernanke’s successor must lead the Fed’s fractious policy-making committee in deciding how much longer and how much harder it should push to stimulate growth and seek to drive down the unemployment rate.
0~Trump Attacks Amazon, Saying It Does Not Pay Enough Taxes~“The general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,” Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president’s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business. Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment. Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon. Brad Parscale, the president’s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump’s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: “Do not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm…” And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites — some of which Mr. Trump is known to read — have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: “BEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.” What we consider before using anonymous sources. Do the sources know the information? What’s their motivation for telling us? Have they proved reliable in the past? Can we corroborate the information? Even with these questions satisfied, The Times uses anonymous sources as a last resort. The reporter and at least one editor know the identity of the source. Learn more about our process. The Post declined to comment. One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable. People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes. In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.
0~After Fanfare for Baseball, Soccer Is Also Back in South Korea~The players were told by their team, the Gold Coast Titans, that they would not be able to rejoin the squad without the shots. One of them, Nathan Peats, then said he had changed his mind and would get a shot, noting that he was not anti-vaccination, but had been the victim of a bad reaction to a flu shot a few years ago. Another player, Bryce Cartwright, defended his right not to get a shot: “I stand for freedom to choose what goes into our bodies. I am pro-choice, pro-informed consent and pro-medical freedom. I have nothing against people who choose to vaccinate, so to label me an ‘anti-vaxxer’ is spreading misinformation.” Several players from other teams were reported to have also declined flu shots. In the midst of the rugby hubbub, the Australian rules football league said it would merely recommend flu shots, not require them. Let’s hope the next bit of rugby news from Australia is, well, a game of rugby. Youth Baseball is On Youth baseball is returning on Sunday in St. Louis. But the games will look a little different. “Safety of these kids is a high priority,” Rob Worstenholm, the owner of GameTime Tournaments, which is running the event, told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “It’s going to be by those rules. So if you don’t want to play by those rules, then that’s fine, but not with us.” Players, coaches and umpires will have to stay six feet apart, and only three people will be allowed in the dugout at a time. There will be no high-fives or fist pumps. Instead, players will be encouraged to tip their hats to each other. Coaches will not be allowed onto the field to argue a call. The benches will be sanitized between games and the balls will be cleaned between innings. Players will also not be allowed to share equipment or water bottles, and spectators will have to sit in the outfield. “The parents are really mixed,” Worstenholm told The Post-Dispatch. “I’ve heard everything from, ‘Man, I’m ready to play, like, yesterday,’ to ‘I’m not playing at all this year.’”

0~Vaccinated Americans, Let the Unmasked Gatherings Begin (but Start Small)~Vaccinated workers in high-density settings like meatpacking plants do not need to quarantine after an exposure to the coronavirus, but testing is still recommended. The C.D.C. did not revise its travel recommendations, continuing to advise that all Americans stay home unless necessary. Dr. Walensky noted that virus cases had surged every time there had been an increase in travel. “We are really trying to restrain travel,” she said. “And we’re hopeful that our next set of guidance will have more science around what vaccinated people can do, perhaps travel being among them.” The new guidelines clearly detail the rewards of vaccination and are likely to motivate even more Americans to seek immunizations and curb lingering vaccine hesitancy, said Dr. Rebecca Weintraub, an assistant professor of global health and social medicine at the Harvard Medical School. “You can resume an activity that many people are yearning for — to be in proximity with those they love, in small gatherings where you can see each other smile and give each other a hug,” Dr. Weintraub said. “It’s been well studied that anticipation is a significant component of joy,” she added. “These guidelines help each person coming in for a vaccine anticipate future joy. As a physician and vaccinator, I’m thrilled.” Noah Weiland contributed reporting.
0~Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move~WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and setting in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City. “Today we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital,” Mr. Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. “This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It’s something that has to be done.” The president cast his decision as a break with decades of failed policy on Jerusalem, which the United States, along with virtually every other nation in the world, has declined to recognize as the capital since Israel’s founding in 1948. That policy, he said, brought us “no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.” “It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,” Mr. Trump declared.
0~Euro Hits Parity With U.S. Dollar for First Time in 20 Years~The euro’s sharp decline has come as the dollar, for generations one of the safest places to park money, has strengthened against almost every major currency in the world. Currencies move like stocks, bonds or any other asset — investors can buy them directly when they think they will grow in value, and sell when they think they will decline. They also reflect global demand for a country’s assets in general, because buying U.S. government bonds or Apple stock requires getting dollars first, and lots of global trading takes place in dollars. So, as often happens in times of economic distress, people looking for a safe place to put their money have bought more dollars, at the expense of other currencies like the euro. The euro was introduced in 1999 after decades of discussion and planning, with the intention of bringing unity, prosperity and stability to the continent. After two major wars in the first half of the 20th century, the argument for the euro and the broader European project was that common institutions would reduce the risk of war and crisis and provide diplomatic arenas for conflict resolution. The euro was a critical symbol of this unity.
0~Hunting Leaks, Trump D.O.J. Officials Seized Records of Democrats~In 2017 and 2018, a grand jury subpoenaed Apple and another internet service provider for the records of the people associated with the Intelligence Committee. They learned about most of the subpoenas last month, when Apple informed them that their records had been shared but did not detail the extent of the request, committee officials said. A second service provider had notified one member of the committee’s staff about such a request last year. It was not clear why family members or children were involved, but the investigators could have sought the accounts because they were linked or on the theory that parents were using their children’s phones or computers to hide contacts with journalists. There do not appear to have been similar grand jury subpoenas for records of members or staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to another official familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee did not respond to a question about whether they were issued subpoenas. The Justice Department has declined to tell Democrats on the committee whether any Republicans were investigated. Apple turned over only metadata and account information, not photos, emails or other content, according to the person familiar with the inquiry. After the records provided no proof of leaks, prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington discussed ending that piece of their investigation. But Mr. Barr’s decision to bring in an outside prosecutor helped keep the case alive. A CNN report in August 2019 about another leak investigation said prosecutors did not recommend to their superiors that they charge Mr. Comey over memos that he wrote and shared about his interactions with Mr. Trump, which were not ultimately found to contain classified information. Mr. Barr was wary of how Mr. Trump would react, according to a person familiar with the situation. Indeed, Mr. Trump berated the attorney general, who defended the department, telling the president that there was no case against Mr. Comey to be made, the person said. But an investigation remained open into whether Mr. Comey had leaked other classified information about Russia.

As someone already a “target” of the United States government, I found it difficult not to worry about the chain of unintended consequences I might unleash by calling Mr. Binney, a 32-year veteran of the National Security Agency turned whistle-blower. He picked up. I nervously explained I was a documentary filmmaker and wanted to speak to him. To my surprise he replied: “I’m tired of my government harassing me and violating the Constitution. Yes, I’ll talk to you.” Two weeks later, driving past the headquarters of the N.S.A. in Maryland, outside Washington, Mr. Binney described details about Stellar Wind, the N.S.A.’s top-secret domestic spying program begun after 9/11, which was so controversial that it nearly caused top Justice Department officials to resign in protest, in 2004. Image Credit... Jacob Appelbaum “The decision must have been made in September 2001,” Mr. Binney told me and the cinematographer Kirsten Johnson. “That’s when the equipment started coming in.” In this Op-Doc, Mr. Binney explains how the program he created for foreign intelligence gathering was turned inward on this country. He resigned over this in 2001 and began speaking out publicly in the last year. He is among a group of N.S.A. whistle-blowers, including Thomas A. Drake, who have each risked everything — their freedom, livelihoods and personal relationships — to warn Americans about the dangers of N.S.A. domestic spying.
0~Carriers Step Up Battle for Wireless Customers~LAS VEGAS — A tug of war has broken out among the major wireless carriers. As Americans rely more on their mobile devices, guzzling data along the way, the carriers are aggressively wooing new customers. In perhaps the most daring move yet, T-Mobile US, the country’s No. 4 carrier, announced on Wednesday that it would cover the termination fees for individuals as well as up to five lines per family for consumers who leave their carrier. Customers can receive up to $650 in credit after trading in their phone. It is the latest in a series of moves the company has made to gain customers, helping T-Mobile stand out among competitors whose offerings have largely remained the same — two-year contracts, complex family plans and stiff early-termination fees. The industry is “just broken,” John Legere, T-Mobile’s chief executive, said at a news conference on Wednesday. He added: “What we are going to do is force the industry to get healthier.”
0~Gracie Gold’s Battle for Olympic Glory Ended in a Fight to Save Herself~These days Gold is on better terms with her family. She received a Prozac prescription at the Meadows, but she said she had weaned herself off it. And she comes to the rink in any kind of weather wearing rimless orange sunglasses, which give her a brighter outlook. Gold gravitated back to skating because she sought the kind of structure that had grounded her during treatment. Last spring, she moved to the Philadelphia area for a fresh start with a new coach, Vincent Restencourt, who earned her trust by insisting that she gradually reverse her weight gain. He insists on dining with Gold at least once a week, and at their first meal together he coaxed her into eating at least half a hamburger, emphasizing that she should not starve herself back into shape. Since June, Gold has lost more than 30 pounds, the result of a healthier combination of foods, she said, not any fad diet. She gives skating lessons to young children and adults, trains alongside teenagers and wonders what they must be thinking. “When I was their age,” Gold said, “I never had a semiretired, mentally ill Olympian come to my rink.” The comeback feels a lot like starting from scratch. The first time Gold executed a clean triple Lutz, she felt an immense sense of accomplishment. “You forget how magical those moments are,” she said. Whenever Gold returns to competition, she will have a new long program, the one she planned to unveil in Detroit. It is set to Sara Bareilles’s “She Used to Be Mine,” a song that she found in her mother’s playlist.
0~U.S. Will Hold Part of Afghan Prison After Handover~In an interview last week, the Afghan official who runs the Afghan-controlled portions of Parwan, Gen. Ghulam Farouk, acknowledged that the Afghan guards were still “in the process of building our capacity.” Three American officials sat in on the interview at his office at Parwan, while in a dusty yard outside his window, a graduation ceremony for about 100 guards unfolded. Behind them, a bus delivered detainees’ families for visits. While General Farouk said the process of transferring the initial group of Afghan detainees was almost complete, because of delicate relations with a “neighboring country” — a reference to Pakistan — he said it would be best if the United States kept the foreign detainees for now. “If we keep these people with us in this current situation and deal with them, this will create more problems for us,” he said. “Therefore it is better for the Americans to keep them.” When transferred, prisoners leave their cells in one of the remaining American-controlled buildings and are taken to new cells in a building controlled by Afghans, but where American personnel will still be present in an advisory role until at least March, under the agreement. An Afghan committee sorts the detainees into two groups: so far, General Farouk said, 1,638 have been approved for criminal prosecution, and 963 have been referred to a review board, which evaluates them and recommends whether to keep holding them without trial as wartime detainees. The agreement calls on Afghanistan to consult the United States and “consider favorably” its assessment of whether a detainee poses a continuing security threat or should be released, but it is ambiguous about which country has final say. As a practical matter, the United States military still controls the perimeter of the base around the prison complex. To date, officials of both countries say, there have been no disagreements between General Farouk and his American counterpart, Lt. Gen. Keith M. Huber. There are early signs, however, that the Afghans may be more inclined to release detainees than not. General Farouk said that so far the review board had finished evaluating about 600 men and recommended that he release 374. None have yet been freed, and he was vague about how many might be, but suggested it could be a majority. A major task for American officials has been to declassify as much evidence as possible showing that each detainee may be an insurgent. The dossiers, given to the Afghans when each detainee is transferred, can be used by the Afghan court or its review boards.
0~In Moscow, the Fighting Is a World Away~But while many Muscovites embrace revelry and willful ignorance, many of the capital’s intelligentsia, whose work and life tied them to the West or to Ukraine, are struggling to reconcile the feeling of normalcy with the enormity of being engaged in Europe’s biggest land war since World War II. That was evident on Saturday in the outpouring of sympathy and appreciation for the former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, expressed by thousands of Russians attending his funeral, who represented a silent protest against Mr. Putin and his policies. As soon as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, said Anya, she started reading books about the rise of totalitarianism in Nazi Germany and grappling with the concept of collective guilt. “It was the end of the world for so many people,” said Anya, 34. Like several others interviewed for this article, she did not want to provide her last name for fear of retribution. “In your name, someone is killing civilians,’’ she said. “And your country is turning into something like North Korea.” She said she went to a protest and signed an antiwar petition, and several days later, she was invited to resign from her job at a public institution.
0~What Is Lost by Burying the Trans-Pacific Partnership?~WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders confirmed this week what seemed inevitable with the triumph of Donald J. Trump: The far-reaching trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim nations that President Obama hoped to leave as a major legacy, but which Mr. Trump called “a terrible deal,” is dead. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, told labor leaders on Thursday that the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade agreement in history, would not be approved by Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said flat-out “no” when reporters on Wednesday asked whether the agreement would be considered in the lame-duck Congress that convenes next week — its last legislative chance, given the opposition from the president-elect. Mr. Trump, whose invectives against trade agreements were central to his appeal to disaffected working-class voters, will have the authority as president “to negotiate better deals, as I think he would put it,” Mr. McConnell said. Yet there is little likelihood of Mr. Trump seeking a new agreement. That reflects not only his campaign statements, but also his yearslong hostility to past trade accords as well as the sheer difficulty of renegotiating a Pacific pact that was seven years in the making, entailing compromises among a dozen countries including Australia, Canada, Chile and Japan, but excluding China.

0~Between the Presidency and Him~Always passionate, the essays grow increasingly precise. With “Why Do So Few Blacks Study the Civil War?” Coates found not so much his subject as a language for it. He starts to quote historians to show where we’ve been; makes regular reference to Reconstruction and the regression and receding of the American dream; invokes the demonization of “super-predators” and Sister Souljah — all with elegance and insight. His is one of the chorus of voices (following, I’d argue, those of our poets) critiquing not only American nostalgia, both black and white, but the very notion of progress. It is the record of his struggle as a writer that is of great interest here. As in Baldwin, the struggle of the writing dovetails with the struggle of the race. This becomes clearest in his 2014 essay “The Case for Reparations,” which became Coates’s calling card, and rightly so: It provides a remarkable pocket history of the financial toll of white supremacy, from disenfranchisement to land grabs to redlining, offering a harrowing account of the economic injustices imposed on African-Americans. Framed by one man’s moving from Mississippi to Chicago during the Great Migration only to encounter the same-old systematic shafting in what we used to call “Up South,” it isn’t cross-burning but the slow burn of oppression that makes the blood boil. Compelling and compulsory, “The Case for Reparations” is as convincing in its restraint and pacing as it is in its depth of research and recognition of black humanity. Even if readers don’t see their own families, as I did, in the tales of the Federal Housing Administration’s discriminatory practices or the “kleptocracy” of black-owned land “taken through means ranging from legal chicanery to terrorism,” we can see the forms of injustice that persist and speak to basic rights: Where can one live? Indeed, who gets to live? “Racism is not merely a simplistic hatred,” Coates points out. “It is, more often, broad sympathy toward some and broader skepticism toward others.” He also highlights the effect of racist policies on the polity — and just how “plunder in the past made plunder in the present efficient,” affecting everything from subprime mortgages to mandatory minimum sentencing. This story is now one that others are telling more fully — books like Carol Anderson’s “White Rage” and Ibram X. Kendi’s “Stamped From the Beginning” help detail the history of reactions to and restrictions of black advances — yet few have done it more succinctly than Coates, or with more power: “What is needed is an airing of family secrets, a settling with old ghosts. What is needed is a healing of the American psyche and the banishment of white guilt.” Obama remains an important foil for Coates, one he fruitfully returns to with “My President Was Black,” a feature begun before the 2016 election (and published after) that shows Coates’s new status — he is now a regular enough White House visitor that he scores an extensive interview — while foreshadowing the ways both men underestimated the opposition, if for different reasons. To Coates, and to many, Obama “became a symbol of black people’s everyday, extraordinary Americanness”; but where Obama’s blindness to Trump’s electoral victory stems, Coates believes, from Obama’s essential optimism, for Coates, any unseeing came from a well-earned pessimism: “I was shocked at my own shock.” The election of President Obama inspired not only Coates but, as he points out, “a crop of black writers and journalists who achieved prominence during his two terms.” The undeniable black renaissance in poetry and cinema, from documentaries like “I Am Not Your Negro” to horror films like “Get Out,” has been met by fellow adventurers in the essay, from Teju Cole to Jesmyn Ward to Kiese Laymon to Roxane Gay. Obama also embodies a phrase that might serve as an alternative subtitle of “Eight Years,” since it appears so often: Being Twice as Good. This phrase is simultaneously the injunction black families have had to give their progeny in a world redlined against them, while also being the very idea that Coates examines as an unjust “double standard.” It is this double standard, he argues, that brought about President Trump: “Barack Obama delivered to black people the hoary message that in working twice as hard as white people, anything is possible. But Trump’s counter is persuasive — work half as hard as black people and even more is possible.” As Coates turns the heat lower, his brilliance cooks more evenly — and more urgently. Never is this more true than in “The First White President,” his recent cover story for the Atlantic. The essay, presented here as an epilogue, manages to be as bloodless as it is blistering. Coates rebukes those on the left who try to pawn Trump off “as a product of the white working class as opposed to a product of an entire whiteness that includes the very authors doing the pawning.” To Coates, Trump’s “ideology is white supremacy in all of its truculent and sanctimonious power”; to pretend otherwise is to treat “white labor as noble archetype, and black labor as something else.”

ISIS expanded its attacks into Iraq’s oil-producing areas in June, and an August sweep into the Kurdish region gave it access to more of the country’s oil assets. Experts estimate that the Iraqi oil fields under ISIS control may produce 25,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil a day — worth a minimum of $1.2 million in the underground market.

Among the weapons that Conflict Armament Research examined were M16 and M4 rifles stamped “Property of U.S. Govt.” Such weapons are also in the hands of irregular Shiite forces in Iraq, where the United States provided hundreds of thousands of small arms to supportive forces during its long occupation. Conflict Armament Research found M79 antitank rockets from the former Yugoslavia that were identical to M79 rockets provided by Saudi Arabia to rebels in Syria.
0~‘Scene of Carnage’ Inside Sold-Out Paris Concert Hall~PARIS — The band had been playing to the crowd at one of this city’s most popular music venues, the Bataclan, for about an hour. The 150-year-old music hall was sold out for the show by the American group Eagles of Death Metal. Suddenly, four men brandishing AK-47 assault rifles entered the hall. There were shouts of “Allahu akbar” just before the gunmen opened fire, and for about 20 minutes there was carnage. Witnesses said the attackers also threw grenades into the crowd. “When they started shooting, we just saw flashes,” a witness named Gwen told French BFM-TV. “People got down on the ground right away. It was all dark.”
0~Could Trump Muzzle Comey? A Look at Executive Privilege~WASHINGTON — James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee next Thursday. That prospect raises a question for President Trump’s legal and political advisers: Should the president invoke executive privilege to try to block Mr. Comey from talking? A public airing of Mr. Comey’s conversations with Mr. Trump could be damaging, given that Democrats have accused the president of obstructing justice by firing Mr. Comey, who was leading the bureau’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia. The New York Times has reported that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to declare loyalty and to drop the case against Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, but that Mr. Comey had demurred. Here is a guide to the issues that would be raised by applying executive privilege in this case. What is executive privilege? Presidents have claimed the power under the Constitution to prevent the other branches of government from gaining access to certain internal executive branch information. The Supreme Court first recognized this power in a 1974 case about whether President Richard M. Nixon had to turn over tapes of his Oval Office conversations to the Watergate prosecutor. One type of privilege covers communications between the president or top White House aides and subordinate members of the executive branch. The idea is that if Congress could get access to those private communications, it would chill the candor of the advice the president received and inhibit his ability to carry out his constitutionally assigned duties.
0~The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud~In Washington, the losing Republican candidate for governor, Loren Culp, has disputed the Republican secretary of state’s determination that the election there was free of fraud. The secretary of state, Kim Wyman, has in turn challenged Mr. Culp, trailing by roughly 14 percentage points in the results, to produce evidence. “It’s just throwing grass at the fence at this point,” she said in an interview. “See what sticks.” Democrats have more frequently been the target of criticism. Last week, the Republican leadership of the Pennsylvania state legislature called on Kathy Boockvar, the Democratic secretary of state, to step down. In Wisconsin, the Republican speaker of the Assembly announced he would form committees to investigate voter fraud in the wake of Mr. Biden’s narrow victory in the state, though there is no evidence of any. Republican lawmakers in Michigan on Saturday voted to issue subpoenas for documents in search of “election irregularities.” Indeed, Republicans in all three “blue wall” states have initiated “investigations” or called for audits — which is redundant given the certification work already underway. Democrats say this is simply a way to undermine confidence in the results. How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers.

On Monday, the Trump campaign accelerated their legal efforts, filing a lawsuit in the seven Pennsylvania counties where the president lost that claimed mail voting created an unfair, “two-tiered” system during the election — though the system is also in place in counties the president won. The campaign also announced plans to file another suit in Michigan. The president has kept up a barrage of Twitter posts with false claims about improprieties in Nevada and Pennsylvania, predicting he’d prevail in Georgia, where he is behind, and said Wisconsin “needs a little time statutorily,” though he offered no explanation for what he meant. Nellie Gorbea, the Democratic secretary of state in Rhode Island, said the amount of attention on the election would make illegal voting extremely difficult. “It would be nearly impossible to do voter fraud in this election because of the number of people tuned in,” she said. Voting fraud in the United States is extremely rare. The irregularities that do occur are often inconsequential, isolated in nature, and unlikely to alter the outcome of an election. The most significant episode of election fraud over the past several years involved an alleged effort to manipulate ballots to benefit a Republican candidate for Congress in North Carolina, Mark Harris, in 2018. The scheme forced a new election and an operative who worked for Mr. Harris, L. McCrae Dowless, is under indictment. Mr. Harris was not charged with wrongdoing, and denied any role.
0~‘Hack Attack,’ About a Rupert Murdoch Paper’s Trials, by Nick Davies~There’s a long, florid history of tabloid excess in Britain, hardly restricted to the Murdoch-owned papers. This part of the tale began in 2006, when Clive Goodman, the royals editor at The News of the World, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator the newspaper had hired, were arrested and charged with hacking the phones of the British royal family. The pair eventually pleaded guilty and went to prison, and Andy Coulson, the editor of The News of the World at the time, resigned. News Corporation officials insisted it was an isolated incident spawned by a rogue reporter, an assertion that turned Davies into something of a rogue himself because he knew better. On July 8, 2009, Davies published the first of what would be many articles in The Guardian about the extent of hacking at The News of the World, writing that News Corporation had paid out more than £1 million to settle hacking cases that would have led to embarrassing exposures, and pointedly noting that Coulson, by then the Conservative leader David Cameron’s communications director, had served as deputy editor and then editor of The News of the World while much of the hacking had gone on. There were many attempts to knock down and minimize the story, but working in concert with the attorneys of several victims, Davies published a series of reports over the next few years suggesting that hacking was rife and that knowledge of the practice went right to the top of the newspapers and the political establishment. As an old hand in journalism, Davies knew the dimensions of the cesspool and was more than willing to stand in the muck for years to figure out what was at the bottom. He is, as it turns out, just the kind of person you don’t want to have on your tail. It’s less about his strategic brilliance and more about an innate refusal to give up — ever. That which cannot be known is precisely what Davies wants to know, over and over again. He wages a ground war to get at the truth, which comes less in one single “aha” moment than as a slow drip of facts penetrating a tissue of lies. Evidence is destroyed just before he gets his hands on it, the police redact documents so as to denude them of value. Then, just in the nick of time, a confidential source or secret document arrives. In that sense, the book moves right along, from cliffhanger to cliffhanger. Davies is, as these things often go, the lonely hero of his own telling, though Alan Rusbridger, the bespectacled editor of The Guardian, is given credit for backing him when others thought he was a bit off his rocker. But as is frequently the case in books by investigative reporters, everything the editor made him leave out of his coverage for the sake of clarity and narrative momentum now becomes string for the book. And since every misdemeanor is a potential felony to Davies, he chases them all down. However, those exhausting tendencies are really not a deal breaker for the reader, given how good a story Davies uncovered and now is in a position to tell. For a time that story seemed stuck, but then in September 2010, The New York Times Magazine published an article that included on-the-record confirmation, by former News of the World reporters, of widespread hacking. Much of the British press were bystanders to a huge story that took place right in their midst. Davies’s depiction of Fleet Street, and in particular the thuggish deputies who ran The News of the World, is great industry portraiture. It was a hellish place, where editors waved magic wands until reporters made stories come true. The fairness of that reporting was so much beside the point that the question barely arose. British journalism is a ferociously competitive industry where success is measured on the newsstand and in getting consumers to part with their money. As such, it is a place of campaigns, with targets caricatured to the point that much of any given newspaper seems like a comics page.
0~Michael Bloomberg Will Address Coronavirus in Prime-Time TV Ad~As Mr. Bloomberg has sought to rebound from his performances in two Democratic debates and build support in the run-up to Super Tuesday, he has increasingly focused his campaign on his experience handling disasters as the mayor of New York, while contrasting himself with Mr. Trump and his handling of the Coronavirus outbreak. In the ad that will air Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg does not mention Mr. Trump by name. Instead, he cites his own leadership experience rebuilding New York City after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, and grappling with public health problems like West Nile virus and swine flu. “Each crisis is different, but they all require steady leadership, team building and preparation,” he says in the address. “As Americans we have faced many challenges before, and we have overcome them together by looking out for one another — and I am confident that is how we will get through this one as well.” The deal between NBC and the Bloomberg campaign was completed on Friday, according to a person familiar with the negotiations who was not authorized to speak about them publicly. The three-minute spot will run during “Little Big Shots,” a variety show featuring child performers hosted by the actress Melissa McCarthy. Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.
0~Crave Huge Risk? This Investment May Be for You~"SPAC management teams are clearly opting out of the onerous process of raising a private equity fund, which can take up to a year. They may be doing this because they are impatient: why make all the effort to persuade a big pension fund like the California Public Employees' Retirement System to invest $100 million when you can attract that much from individual and institutional investors in the market? It is unreasonable enough that Wall Street can maintain a 7 percent cartel on initial public offerings. But SPAC underwriters can charge an additional 2 percent because underwriting alternative investments -- like hedge or private equity funds -- is the 2005 equivalent of the California gold rush. But the ""risk factors"" listed in filings by SPAC's with the S.E.C. show the real risk in such entities. ""Since we have not currently selected a particular industry or any target business with which to complete a business combination, we are unable to currently ascertain the merits or risks of the industry or business in which we may ultimately operate,"" reads a passage from one SPAC, the Millstream Acquisition Corporation. In other words, SPAC's are not for the fainthearted. But these acquisition companies are not without virtues. The market for small initial public offerings has evaporated, leaving few options for small, productive companies that want to go public to raise cash. A SPAC can buy a company, effectively creating a publicly traded company overnight through a reverse merger. Between 1999 and 2004, the amount raised in initial offerings has fallen 26 percent, according to Thomson Financial; the amount for offerings under $100 million has fallen 68 percent. Unlike private equity investors, SPAC investors can get out when they want -- if they can find a buyer for the shares. That may be difficult in many instances because the banks that underwrite the shares do not make markets in them. And only a few SPAC's have actually completed acquisitions, calling into question the entire premise behind them. Nonetheless, the prices of the companies that have done deals are rising. Chardan China Acquisition went public in March 2004 at $6. In December, it announced that it would buy State Harvest Holdings and convert into a British Virgin Island company. Its stock is currently trading at $9.15 and the unit, which includes the warrants issued to original shareholders, is trading at $17. In March 2004, Millstream and NationsHealth Holdings merged. Traded on Nasdaq's small-cap market, the shares (with warrants) are currently worth $12.62. It went public at $6."
0~Moderna Coronavirus Vaccine Trial Shows Promising Early Results~If those trials go well, some doses of a vaccine could become available for widespread use by the end of this year or early 2021, Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, said in an interview. “We’re doing our best to make it as many millions as possible.” President Trump said last week that a vaccine would be available before the end of this year. His prediction was supported by Moncef Slaoui, the newly appointed leader of Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s effort to speed vaccine development. At a briefing last week, Mr. Slaoui, a former member of Moderna’s board of directors who resigned when he took up his new government post, said he had seen preliminary research data that convinced him that a vaccine could be created by the end of the year. He did not identify the data. Also on Monday, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed that Mr. Slaoui would divest his Moderna stock options, valued at about $10 million, on Tuesday morning. Ms. Oakley added that Mr. Slaoui would donate to cancer research the increased value his shares had accrued from last Thursday until Tuesday’s sale. The share price closed at $80 on Monday, up from $64.56 last Thursday, adding $2.4 million to the value of his options. At a round table with restaurant executives at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said, “This was a very big day, cure wise and vaccine wise,” and noted that the markets were lifted by drug news. Moderna produced the vaccine in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the institute that is headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci and has been leading the clinical trials. Part of the National Institutes of Health, the agency is involved in research on other experimental coronavirus vaccines. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have each received roughly half a billion dollars from the U.S. government, to speed development of a vaccine. The people vaccinated in Moderna’s Phase 1 study described on Monday were healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55. Their immune systems made antibodies that were then tested in infected cells in the lab, and were able to stop the virus from replicating — the key requirement for an effective vaccine. The levels of those so-called neutralizing antibodies matched or exceeded the levels found in patients who had recovered after contracting the virus in the community. Dr. Mark J. Mulligan, director of the N.Y.U. Langone Vaccine Center, called the Moderna findings “very encouraging.” He added, “It’s a small number of participants, but it appears to be a really good start.” Dr. Mulligan was not involved in the early testing but expected to participate in a later phase of the Moderna vaccine research.
0~Trump Administration Mulls a Unilateral Tax Cut for the Rich~WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering bypassing Congress to grant a $100 billion tax cut mainly to the wealthy, a legally tenuous maneuver that would cut capital gains taxation and fulfill a long-held ambition of many investors and conservatives. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina this month that his department was studying whether it could use its regulatory powers to allow Americans to account for inflation in determining capital gains tax liabilities. The Treasury Department could change the definition of “cost” for calculating capital gains, allowing taxpayers to adjust the initial value of an asset, such as a home or a share of stock, for inflation when it sells. “If it can’t get done through a legislation process, we will look at what tools at Treasury we have to do it on our own and we’ll consider that,” Mr. Mnuchin said, emphasizing that he had not concluded whether the Treasury Department had the authority to act alone. “We are studying that internally, and we are also studying the economic costs and the impact on growth.” Currently, capital gains taxes are determined by subtracting the original price of an asset from the price at which it was sold and taxing the difference, usually at 20 percent. If a high earner spent $100,000 on stock in 1980, then sold it for $1 million today, she would owe taxes on $900,000. But if her original purchase price was adjusted for inflation, it would be about $300,000, reducing her taxable “gain” to $700,000. That would save the investor $40,000.
0~Damaged by an Explosion, the Canvas Emerged a Gentileschi~Buchakjian identified “Hercules and Omphale,” which long hung at the Sursock Palace as an anonymous 17th-century painting, as a Gentileschi in the art magazine Apollo soon after the Beirut explosion, based on graduate-level research he had undertaken at the Sorbonne several years before. (He also ascribed to Gentileschi a smaller painting of Mary Magdalene that hung nearby; it has already been restored and exhibited in Italy.) Invited by Barker to do an online presentation, he made a persuasive case for the new attribution based mainly on stylistic traits shared with Gentileschi’s known artworks, such as Hercules’s pose and her treatment of jewelry like cameo brooches and pearl drop earrings. He also noted that a similarly sized painting by Gentileschi on the subject of Hercules was recorded in 1699 in the Naples collection of Alonso de Cárdenas. Buchakjian’s visual analysis was convincing, said Barker, who calls the artist’s detailed and imaginative approach to jewelry one of her hallmarks. “She more often than not will use a notable level of invention or innovation, painting jewelry that may not have ever existed but was still perfectly in line with taste of her time,” she said, noting that Gentileschi’s grandfather was an esteemed jewelry designer who worked on the first grand ducal crown for the Medici dynasty. Dating Gentileschi’s work is notoriously tricky, but Gasparotto believes that the damaged painting was made during a period when the artist lived in Naples, “which has always in some way been the black hole of Artemisia’s career — considered less important and interesting.” He added that it most likely dated to the mid-1630s based on similarities with Gentileschi’s “Bathsheba at Her Bath” and “Lot and His Daughters” that Buchakjian had pointed out.
0~U.S. Coronavirus Cases Are Rising Sharply, but Deaths Are Still Down~After a minor late-spring lull, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States is once again on the rise. States like Arizona, Florida and Texas are seeing some of their highest numbers to date, and as the nation hurtles further into summer, the surge shows few signs of stopping. And yet the virus appears to be killing fewer of the people it infects. In April and May, Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, led to as many as 3,000 deaths per day, and claimed the lives of roughly 7 to 8 percent of Americans known to have been infected. The number of daily deaths is now closer to 600, and the death rate is less than 5 percent. In general, experts see three broad reasons for the downward trend in the rate of coronavirus deaths: testing, treatment and a shift in whom the virus is infecting. The relative contribution of these factors is not yet clear. And because death reports can lag diagnoses by weeks, the current rise in coronavirus cases could still portend increases in mortality in the days to come. Testing on the rise Since mid-March, when the coronavirus was declared a national emergency, diagnostic testing for the coronavirus has risen significantly. More than 600,000 tests are administered each day in the United States, up from about 100,000 per day in early spring. Although the nation is still falling short of the millions of daily tests that experts have called for, the increased testing has identified many more infected individuals with mild or no symptoms, driving down the overall proportion of patients who die from Covid-19, said Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
0~¿El coronavirus es una epidemia o una pandemia?~Regístrate para recibir nuestro boletín con lo mejor de The New York Times. [Actualización del 11 de marzo a las 12:44 EST] La OMS ha declarado una pandemia global. La propagación del coronavirus en más de cien países ahora califica como una pandemia global, dieron a conocer funcionarios de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) este miércoles y confirmaron así lo que muchos epidemiólogos han estado diciendo durante semanas. Hasta ahora, la OMS había evitado utilizar el término para describir la epidemia que avanzaba de país en país por temor a dar la impresión de que era imparable y que las naciones se dieran por vencidas en los esfuerzos por detenerla. La organización informó con anterioridad que ya no declaraba oficialmente cuando una epidemia alcanzaba proporciones de pandemia y que más bien prefería declarar emergencias globales de salud pública. “Pandemia no es una palabra que se use a la ligera o de manera descuidada”, dijo en una conferencia de prensa en Ginebra el doctor Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director de la OMS. “Todos los países pueden aún cambiar el curso de esta pandemia”, agregó. Sin embargo, ahora hay evidencia en seis continentes de transmisión sostenida del virus, que ha infectado a más de 120.000 personas y matado a más de 4300 y que para la gran mayoría de criterios médicos constituye una pandemia. La designación en sí misma es principalmente simbólica, pero los funcionarios de salud pública saben que junto con la palabra el público escuchará elementos de peligro y riesgo.
0~La inteligencia artificial predice las formas de las moléculas del futuro~Hacia el final de una semana de trabajo, envió a DeepMind una lista de siete enzimas. El lunes siguiente, el laboratorio devolvió las formas de las siete. “Esto nos hizo avanzar un año respecto a donde estábamos, si no es que dos”, dijo McGeehan. Ahora, cualquier bioquímico puede acelerar su trabajo de forma muy similar. El jueves, DeepMind publicó las formas previstas de más de 350.000 proteínas, los mecanismos microscópicos que impulsan el comportamiento de las bacterias, los virus, el cuerpo humano y todos los demás seres vivos. Esta nueva base de datos incluye las estructuras tridimensionales de todas las proteínas expresadas por el genoma humano, así como las de las proteínas que aparecen en otros 20 organismos, incluidos el ratón, la mosca de la fruta y la bacteria E. coli. Este vasto y detallado mapa biológico —que proporciona unas 250.000 formas hasta ahora desconocidas— puede acelerar la capacidad de entender las enfermedades, desarrollar nuevas medicinas y reutilizar las existentes. También puede conducir a nuevos tipos de herramientas biológicas, como una enzima que descompone eficazmente las botellas de plástico y las convierte en materiales fácilmente reutilizables y reciclables. “Esto puede adelantarte en el tiempo e influir en la forma de pensar en los problemas y ayudar a resolverlos más rápidamente”, dijo Gira Bhabha, profesora adjunta del departamento de biología celular de la Universidad de Nueva York. “Tanto si estudias neurociencia como inmunología —sea cual sea tu campo de la biología— esto puede ser útil”.
0~‘The Picture Taker’ Review: Civil Rights Photographer and F.B.I. Informant~After the photojournalist Ernest Withers died in 2007, a bombshell investigation revealed that the respected Memphis photographer, known for taking over a million pictures of 20th-century Black life during his career, had also been a paid informant of the F.B.I. The documentary “The Picture Taker,” directed by Phil Bertelsen (“Who Killed Malcolm X?”), uses this fact as an entry point into a compelling biography of Withers, whose photographs helped chronicle important events in the civil rights movement, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s final days spent supporting the 1968 sanitation workers’ strike in Memphis. “The Picture Taker” presents several perspectives on Withers’s link to the F.B.I. and noticeably does not come down on a particular side — unlike “Judas and the Black Messiah,” a 2021 historical drama about the murder of the activist and Chicago Black Panther Party leader Fred Hampton, which took up similar subject matter.
0~Republicans Killed the Obamacare Mandate. New Data Shows It Didn’t Really Matter.~“We didn’t have that much information to go on in modeling the effects of the mandate,” said Doug Elmendorf, who directed the Congressional Budget Office during the health law’s passage. “We and others put weight on Massachusetts because the Affordable Care Act looked a lot like what Governor Romney did there. But Massachusetts is just one of 50 states, and each state is different.” Mr. Saltzman went on to earn a doctorate in economics after his job at RAND, and focused his research on the mandate. He has found that the mandate isn’t a very effective tool for increasing enrollment. One recent paper of his estimated that eliminating the mandate penalties would reduce marketplace enrollment by 2 percent and increase premiums by 0.7 percent. “My viewpoint on the mandate has changed,” he said. “Back in 2012, my sense was it was essential. The evidence indicates that the marketplaces are doing about the same as they were before the mandate was set to zero.” Separately, in The New England Journal of Medicine last year, researchers concluded that “the individual mandate’s exemptions and penalties had little impact on coverage rates.” Instead, they found that generous subsidies for middle-income Americans, coupled with Medicaid expansion in most states, drove health law enrollment. “The mandate made a difference, but not a huge difference in terms of the numbers of people signing up,” said Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the study. He advised the Obama administration on health reform and recommended the mandate, but now says “it was not as effective as anticipated.” Participation in Obamacare marketplaces has decreased slightly, to 11.4 million this year from 12.2 million in 2017. But it hasn’t plummeted or shown any signs of a “death spiral,” in which only sick patients purchase coverage and premiums become unaffordable. When Obamacare enrollees are asked about why they buy coverage, the mandate is the least common reason given. Economists have done plenty of speculating about why the mandate didn’t work as expected. The penalties were relatively small — $695 or 2.5 percent of income, whichever was higher — in an effort to tamp down political resistance and court Republican legislators. That was largely unsuccessful: No Republican legislators voted for Obamacare and, within days of its passage, false claims went viral that the Internal Revenue Service would send thousands of armed agents to Americans’ homes to collect the fees.
0~THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: On the Trail; PEROT HAD HARSH WORDS FOR SEX ON 'DOOGIE HOWSER'~"Ross Perot, who described the criticism of the ""Murphy Brown"" television character by Vice President Dan Quayle as ""goofy,"" himself criticized a character on the television show ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" a few months earlier for having sex. The Los Angeles Times reported today that in a Sept. 26 meeting at its Washington news bureau, Mr. Perot cited fictional television shows as setting bad examples and referred to an episode of ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" in which the title character and his girlfriend, both 18 years old, lost their virginity. The Times reported that Mr. Perot said: ""Some 15-year-old girl that's been thinking about it hadn't done it yet. 'Hell, Doogie's girl did it. It must be all right.' You and I didn't see that kind of stuff growing up."" Last month, after Vice President Quayle criticized the values portrayed when the unmarried character on ""Murphy Brown"" had a baby, Mr. Perot commented: ""I just thought it was goofy. When you think of the real problems that face this country, well, suddenly it's 'Murphy Brown' -- which is a fictional, 30-minute show on television."" In the September meeting, Mr. Perot also said of ""Roseanne"" program, ""If you watch Roseanne Barr on television, you don't get a very good role model."" The actress Roseanne Arnold said today that she had been inclined to favor Mr. Perot for President, but after learning of his remark, she would support Gov. Bill Clinton.

0~La Corte Suprema de Brasil suspende a Eduardo Cunha, uno de los principales opositores de Dilma Rousseff~Este es el escándalo más grave en la historia democrática de Brasil y ha elevado la presión para la destitución de Rousseff en medio de la peor recesión que vive ese país desde la década de 1930. Se espera que la próxima semana la presidenta sea suspendida de su cargo cuando el senado vote para que sea enjuiciada por acusaciones de supuestas violaciones a las leyes presupuestarias. Según la Constitución de Brasil, Cunha es el tercero en la línea de sucesión a la Presidencia por su cargo como presidente de la Cámara Baja del Congreso. Es un cristiano evangélico que ha captado el apoyo de la derecha religiosa en el congreso y ha pasado meses evadiendo las audiencias del comité de ética de la Cámara Baja que buscan determinar si mintió sobre sus cuentas bancarias en Suiza. Con la suspensión de Cunha, el Vicepresidente Waldir Maranhao, del Partido Progresista, se convirtió en la cabeza de la Cámara Baja. Si la remoción de Cunha es definitiva, el congreso tiene cinco sesiones para elegir a un nuevo presidente. Un portavoz de la Corte Suprema dijo que el político había sido notificado en su residencia en la madrugada de este jueves. Cunha, un astuto conocedor de los procedimientos legislativos, ha sido llamado por los medios de comunicación como el Frank Underwood de la política brasileña, en referencia al implacable político de la serie de televisión “House of Cards”. Este legislador inició el proceso de juicio político contra Rousseff en diciembre y es un enemigo implacable de la presidenta por lo que su suspensión podría haberla ayudado si hubiera sucedido antes.
0~House Votes to Give the Government the Power to Negotiate Drug Prices~House Republicans countered the Democrats’ bill with a more modest measure, which drew support from eight Democrats when it came to a vote on Thursday. That measure, an amalgam of other bills that have drawn bipartisan support, would also cap out-of-pocket expenses and require insurance companies to make information available about drug prices to patients in doctors’ offices before doctors prescribe them. But it excludes the Medicare negotiation provision. Mr. Trump campaigned in 2016 on allowing the government to negotiate drug prices, but Republicans argued that giving that power to the government would force pharmaceutical companies to eliminate research and development, depriving the public of lifesaving medicines.

Learn more about our process. “For an issue as crucial as lowering the cost of prescription drugs for Americans, partisanship should be set aside,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, said as he made his party’s closing argument for his bill. He warned that the Democrats’ bill was “opening the door to a government takeover of our prescription drug market.” Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, who managed the bill for Republicans on the House floor, cited a Congressional Budget Office estimate showing that the Democrats’ measure would result in 40 fewer drugs over the next two decades. Democrats say their bill addresses research and development concerns by allocating more than $10 billion to the National Institutes of Health for biomedical research, with the goal of advancing breakthrough cures. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the bill would save taxpayers $5 billion over a 10-year period. Allowing Medicare to negotiate prices has been a long-sought goal of Democrats; because the insurance program buys drugs in bulk, it can effectively set the price for all insurers. It was a matter of intense debate in 2003, when the Republican-led Congress passed the bill creating Medicare Part D, which allows Medicare to pay for the cost of prescription drugs. Since that time, the rising list prices of brand-name drugs, coupled with insurance plans that have increasingly raised deductibles and asked consumers to pay more out of pocket, have left many Americans facing difficult choices about whether to forgo medicine in favor of other necessities, including food.
0~Refusing Weinstein’s Hush Money, Rose McGowan Calls Out Hollywood~In The Hollywood Reporter, she passionately defended Renée Zellweger last year from what she perceived as sexist comments in Variety about the actress’s plastic surgery. “How dare you bully a woman who has done nothing but try to entertain people like you?” she wrote, in a direct accusation of the piece’s writer, Owen Glieberman. “It was startling and inspiring to see someone who was willing to put herself out there in support of other women/actresses,” said the actress Molly Ringwald in an email to The Times. “Her tenacity is something that you would hope for in an union leader but of course never really get.” And Ms. McGowan spoke, in veiled terms, to the Buzzfeed reporter Kate Aurthur in 2015 about her experience as an assault victim. “You are taking part of someone’s soul,” she said. “It’s happened to me.” Last year, during a Twitter campaign called #WhyWomenDontReport, she all but named Mr. Weinstein as the perpetrator of the violence against her that she had mentioned in the past. During her recent visit to Hawaii, Ms. McGowan, over a day and a half in Kona, revealed a person much more playful than her fierce Twitter persona. She would interrupt a thought to smile and smell a flower that caught her eye; she could not resist a swing hanging from a large tree, and enjoyed twirling an umbrella the same blue as her sundress while walking on the beach. She seemed free, in some ways, from both a long-kept secret and a labor of love that had occupied her for the last year and a half — her book, “Brave,” which will be released by Harper One early next year. To some degree, she had shielded herself from the news. But when she learned how many women had stepped forward to complain of assault or harassment by Mr. Weinstein, she said: “I knew we are legion. We are legion.” She had been corresponding lately with Asia Argento, an Italian actress who also accused Mr. Weinstein of sexual assault (and was subsequently shamed by the Italian press). “It feels,” Ms. McGowan wrote to Ms. Argento, reading from her text, “‘like toxic slime going out of a spiked birth canal.’ That’s what the whole experience feels like to me. It’s an intense process.” Sometimes she feels fresh rage. “But I’ll tell you what I don’t feel anymore,” she said. “Despair.”
0~The National Rifle Association’s Telegenic Warrior~DALLAS — Dana Loesch has a biblical inscription tattooed on her forearm, a reference to a passage in the Book of Ephesians that calls for Christians to wear holy armor to protect themselves from a dark world. It is an apt precept for Ms. Loesch, a 39-year-old conservative radio talk-show host and political commentator who views the world through a lens of fear and violence. It is why she has an arsenal of firearms strategically placed in safes throughout her home. She keeps a handgun near her bed in the event of an intruder, she said, which she can use until she finds a more powerful shotgun or rifle nearby. She sometimes tucks a gun in the small of her back. Other times, she keeps a knife in her purse. “Evil is real,” she said over a plate of barbecued sausage last month in a suburban restaurant. And if there is a question about what God has to do with any of this, she keeps a sign in the window of the house that she and her family recently vacated. “This home protected by the good lord and a gun,” it read. “If you came here to steal or do harm you might meet them both.”
0~Regulators Unbundle Some Attractions of Mergers~The Securities and Exchange Commission has quietly taken a stand against corporate inversions. Inversions occur when an American company buys a foreign company and reincorporates in that acquisition’s country, where the corporate tax rate is lower than in the United States. Pfizer’s approach to AstraZeneca of Britain last year set off a public uproar about American companies giving up their corporate citizenship. Now there are rumblings that the issue may re-emerge, with Pfizer’s apparent interest in Allergan. Yet the S.E.C. has been prompted to act by an inversion that ultimately led to shareholder concerns over governance, rather than protests over taxes. In this case, it was a deal this year that allowed the drug maker Mylan to move its place of organization to the Netherlands from Pennsylvania. At the time, shareholders applauded the move, which lowered the company’s tax rate. But then a suitor, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, showed up only a few months later. Some of Mylan’s shareholders began to rue their company’s relocation as Mylan suddenly wielded its new Netherlands defenses to fight off Teva.
0~‘This Is a Change Election’: Will 2 Entrenched House Members Fall?~Ms. Clarke compared the ad to the “propaganda that comes from the White House.” Mr. Bunkeddeko sent a fund-raising email saying that he was better suited to take on the kind of “fear mongering” that he said Mr. Deutsch’s ad reflected. “Was my ad dramatic?” Mr. Deutsch said. “Yes. Did it highlight the extremes? Sure, it did. Was it racist? Absolutely not.” Mr. Deutsch has been endorsed the Police Benevolent Association, but he said he believed there was room for the Police Department to make changes. While Mr. Deutsch is expected to cut into Ms. Clarke’s base, Isiah James, a combat veteran and democratic socialist, is running to the left of Mr. Bunkeddeko. Lutchi Gayot, who ran as a Republican against Ms. Clarke in the 2018 general election, is now running as a Democrat. Mr. James, 33, a Black Lives Matter activist, said calls for reform from Mr. Bunkeddeko and Ms. Clarke do not go far enough. The district’s ills, which he described as including hospital closings, discriminatory policing and a lack of affordable housing, had persisted long before the pandemic and the recent protests brought them to the fore, Mr. James said. Ms. Clarke expressed anger over the argument that she had not been active enough in her district or in dealing with the demands created by the outbreak and the calls for racial justice. She said she was proud of legislation she had introduced that would recalibrate a formula used to determine who qualifies for affordable housing. She also introduced legislation that would require companies to check algorithms they use for targeting ads or facial recognition, for example, for evidence of bias.
0~Square to Acquire 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Firm Afterpay~Two financial technology giants that are taking on the traditional banking industry are joining forces to build their alternative to credit cards. Square said on Sunday that it planned to acquire the Australian “buy now, pay later” company Afterpay in an all-stock deal that values Afterpay at about $29 billion. The deal introduces Afterpay’s service, which allows users to stagger the cost of their purchases over interest-free installments, to U.S. consumers and the millions of small businesses that process their credit card transactions on the Square app. It will also help the San Francisco-based Square further expand in Australia, its second-biggest market after the United States. Square’s Cash App, a payment platform with more than 70 million customers, has been a key point of growth for the company, particularly during the pandemic as customers have sought out cash-free options. The company has been looking to integrate that app and its “Seller App” platform for smaller businesses.
0~Ahmaud Arbery’s Killing Will Go to Grand Jury as Graphic Video Emerges~Anger over the case has been building among civil rights activists and others, with the Rev. Al Sharpton calling for an investigation, and state and local N.A.A.C.P. leaders calling for the arrest of the McMichaels. [Read more about the third person charged in Ahmaud Arbery’s death.] “This is very grave and very serious judicial malpractice,” James Woodall, the president of the Georgia N.A.A.C.P., said on Tuesday afternoon. In a statement, Andrea Young, executive director of the A.C.L.U. of Georgia, said “the vigilante behavior that we saw in Brunswick is unacceptable in a civilized society.” A spokesman for the Glynn County Police Department could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. Mr. Durden said in a statement that the case should go before a Glynn County grand jury once the state judicial system allows such bodies to be empaneled again. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Georgia Supreme Court has prohibited grand juries from meeting through June 12. Mr. Durden said he made his decision after “careful review of the evidence,” and after consulting with the Glynn County Police Department, the F.B.I., the United States attorney for the Southern District of Georgia and the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia. Mr. Durden is the third prosecutor to be assigned to the case after the first two recused themselves because of professional ties to Gregory McMichael. Mr. McMichael had recently retired after a long career as an investigator in the Brunswick district attorney’s office. He had also worked for seven years as an officer in the Glynn County Police Department.
0~Trump's Juneteenth in Tulsa: How His Campaign Rally Plans Went Awry~Adding to the anxiety in Tulsa are heightened fears about the risks of the coronavirus. On Wednesday the top health official said he was worried the rally could become a “super spreader” event and recommended it be postponed. How Times reporters cover politics. We rely on our journalists to be independent observers. So while Times staff members may vote, they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. This includes participating in marches or rallies in support of a movement or giving money to, or raising money for, any political candidate or election cause. Learn more about our process. Inside the White House, before the rally was announced, some aides raised concerns about holding it on Juneteenth, and Mr. Parscale conceded he had not been aware of the holiday, multiple people familiar with the conversation said. But he responded that the campaign had held events on Jewish holidays, and last year held a “Merry Christmas” rally in Battle Creek, Mich., none of which were criticized as disrespectful to the people who celebrated those holidays. He said he thought it would not be a problem. White House officials decided that if the rally was to go off as planned, they would have to tack on an official event in Tulsa to acknowledge the importance of Juneteenth and the history of the city, ahead of a raucous event in the evening. But some of them also broached with Mr. Trump the possibility of changing the date. Mr. Trump also heard from outside allies. “I spoke to the president on Friday and he asked me if I thought it would be more respectful to move the rally date off of Juneteenth,” said Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma. “I told him yes.” Mr. Lankford said in an interview that he did not believe the choice of date was intended to provoke more tension over race relations, but rather find an available date in Mr. Trump’s schedule in a state that is open during the pandemic. “Some of the leaders that I’ve talked to on the ground in Tulsa are grateful, and have expressed that and have said, ‘we’re grateful the president moved it, we don’t think it was appropriate that he had a political rally on this date, on this year, at this time,’” Mr. Lankford said. Mr. Trump had also been questioned about the date during a Fox News interview with Harris Faulkner, an African-American host whom Mr. Trump has long admired and praised in private.
0~Getting a Visa to Visit the U.S. Is a Long and Extensive Process for Most~For much of the world, visiting the United States means submitting yourself to an application process that can take months or even a year, and often ends with a denial, even from allies like India and many other countries that were not singled out in Mr. Trump’s revised travel ban. Here is the typical process: 1. Submit the nonimmigrant visa application online. 2. Pay the application fee at a designated bank and sign up for an interview. 3. Gather documents to show that you have a stable life and are not likely to overstay your visa. Recommended documents: A. A letter of introduction from your employer B. An invitation letter from the U.S. C. Your passport D. Bank statements E. Anything else that might prove that you intend to return home. 4. The interview. In some countries, it can take up to four months to get an interview. On the appointed date, you will meet with a Foreign Service officer. The officer could deny your request, sometimes without even looking at your documents. He or she could also refer your case for a deeper review. 5. Your information is checked against American and foreign databases. Officers from various U.S. agencies will also conduct interviews and do further research into your background. 6. If everything checks out, a visa is issued. 7. At the airport, American customs officers do an additional round of behind-the-scenes screening. 8. Upon arrival, you are questioned by customs officers and may be screened again.

Entering the U.S. Without a Visa Visitors from the 38 countries that are members of the visa-waiver program don’t have to follow all the steps above. But they still have to provide personal information to the American government before they can board a plane to the United States. Many citizens of Canada and Bermuda can also visit the United States without a visa.

They go through a shorter process and pay a smaller fee than visa travelers do. They apply for travel authorization by submitting personal information, including employment, communicable diseases and criminal history. After arriving, Customs and Border Protection officers make the final decision regarding entry. The United States changed waiver eligibility for certain visitors last year, after the 2015 Paris attacks. People who had traveled to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen since 2011 became ineligible.
0~Hurricane Maria Does ‘Mind-Boggling’ Damage to Dominica, Leader Says~MEXICO CITY — It was about midnight, as Hurricane Maria was battering the Caribbean nation of Dominica, that Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit took to Facebook. Roofs everywhere, he wrote, were being torn off by the powerful storm’s winds. He himself had to be rescued from his official residence. “We will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds,” he said, describing the damage as “mind-boggling.” And then silence. From Mr. Skerrit — and, it appears, from the rest of the island. As the storm, described by the National Hurricane Center as “potentially catastrophic,” moved toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday, little could be learned about the conditions on Dominica. By early Tuesday morning, phone and internet signals on Dominica appeared to be down, leaving the island virtually incommunicado.
0~Trump Defends Using ‘Chinese Virus’ Label, Ignoring Growing Criticism~At Wednesday’s briefing, a reporter also asked the president what he thought of an unnamed White House official referring to the coronavirus as the “Kung Flu.” Mr. Trump skirted that question before asserting that the Chinese “probably would agree” with the coronavirus as the “Chinese” virus, though Chinese officials have made it clear they do not. Medical historians and public health experts — including some in Mr. Trump’s administration — have emphasized that pandemics have no ethnicity and stressed that associating them with an ethnic group can lead to discrimination. But since the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, Mr. Trump has repeatedly signaled in his public remarks that he viewed the virus as a foreign threat, and has repeatedly highlighted his early decision to close American borders to Chinese travelers. “We closed it down to China, the source, very, very early,” Mr. Trump said to reporters on Tuesday. “Far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. And I think, in the end, that’s going to be — that will have saved a tremendous number of lives.” But Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Mr. Trump’s travel measures fell far short of a comprehensive approach that would include testing and quarantines, and overall were “too little, too late.” The virus most likely emerged in China in November or December, and it is clear that some travelers from China were already spreading the virus within the United States in January, before the restrictions went into place at the beginning of February, Mr. Huang said. Still, since the beginning of the outbreak, Mr. Trump and high-ranking administration officials have sought to pinpoint blame for the spread of the virus on China, and Beijing has responded in kind. The finger-pointing over which country has done less to contain the disease has caused tensions between the two nations almost daily.
0~Karen Olivo Won’t Return to ‘Moulin Rouge!’~Karen Olivo, a Tony-nominated star of “Moulin Rouge! The Musical,” said Wednesday that she would not rejoin the show’s cast when Broadway performances resume. She made the announcement in a five-minute Instagram video. “I could easily go back to the show and make a lot of money,” she said, “but I still wouldn’t be able to really control what I was putting out into the world, and what I’m seeing in this space, right now, with our industry, is that everybody is scared, and nobody is really doing a lot of the stuff that needs to be done.” She referred specifically to the powerful producer Scott Rudin, who has long been described as abusive toward staffers, most recently in a detailed April 7 article in The Hollywood Reporter. Rudin is not a producer of “Moulin Rouge!,” and Olivo has not worked with him, but she has been vocal with her concerns about overall industry practices. “The silence about Scott Rudin: unacceptable,” she said in the video. “That should be a no-brainer.”
0~Malaysia Gambles on Processing Rare Earths~KUANTAN, Malaysia  A colossal construction project here could help determine whether the world can break China’s chokehold on the strategic metals crucial to products as diverse as Apple’s iPhone, Toyota’s Prius and Boeing’s smart bombs. As many as 2,500 construction workers will soon be racing to finish the world’s largest refinery for so-called rare earth metals  the first rare earth ore processing plant to be built outside China in nearly three decades. For Malaysia and the world’s most advanced technology companies, the plant is a gamble that the processing can be done safely enough to make the local environmental risks worth the promised global rewards. Once little known outside chemistry circles, rare earth metals have become increasingly vital to high-tech manufacturing. But as Malaysia learned the hard way a few decades ago, refining rare earth ore usually leaves thousands of tons of low-level radioactive waste behind.
0~Plunge in Lira, Turkey’s Currency, Fuels Fears of Financial Contagion~Turkey’s currency fell to another record low on Monday, hitting stocks in Europe and Asia and raising fears that the country is on the verge of an economic meltdown that could spread to other emerging markets. The crisis, caused by soaring inflation, economic mismanagement by the Turkish government and tensions with the United States, has raised concerns over whether emerging economies that have benefited in recent years from foreign investment may also be vulnerable. Rising interest rates in the United States and in Europe have made investors less tolerant of emerging markets. Foreign investors piled money into Turkish assets for years, lured by what appeared to be a stable economy and higher returns. But as interest rates rise in countries seen as safer, the relative attractiveness of riskier investments wanes. A crisis like the one in Turkey may be all it takes to send them fleeing. Turkey’s central bank insisted over the weekend that it would “take all necessary measures” to preserve the country’s financial stability. But it has so far refused to raise interest rates, and the changes it has pushed through thus far have been limited in scope.
0~You’re a Senior. How Do You Calculate Coronavirus Risk Right Now?~What to do about Lake Placid? For weeks, Dave and Nancy Nathan had been debating whether to proceed with a long-planned family trip to a lodge there next month, marking his 80th birthday. “It looked dreamy, mountains and lakes,” said Nancy, 74. Besides, they hadn’t gathered their clan — three daughters and their families, a dozen people in all — for a year. She thought she and Dave could manage the drive from their home in Bethesda, Md., to upstate New York. He wasn’t so sure. Both retirees, they’d been cautious through the pandemic, mindful that while neither had health conditions that would make Covid-19 especially dangerous, age alone put them at higher risk. They had avoided supermarkets, relying on grocery delivery services and take out food. Dave wore gloves on the tennis court. “I’ve been dubious about travel,” he said. “I have no need to be more daring.” Worried, too, about the family members flying from Oregon and Florida for his birthday, he called himself Dr. No.
0~Will You Lose Your Job to a Robot? Silicon Valley Is Split~There is little disagreement that machines are outworking humans. They have progressed from displacing factory workers to personal assistants and even lawyers, and much of our lives will be digitized or augmented even more in a decade. The question for Silicon Valley is whether we’re heading toward a robot-led coup or a leisure-filled utopia. The Pew Research Center published a report Wednesday based on interviews with 2,551 people who make, research and analyze new technology. Most agreed that robotics and artificial intelligence would transform daily life by 2025, but respondents were almost evenly split about what that might mean for the economy and employment. On one side were the techno-optimists. They believe that even though machines will displace many jobs in a decade, technology and human ingenuity will produce many more, as happened after the agricultural and industrial revolutions. The meaning of “job” might change, too, if people find themselves with hours of free time because the mundane tasks that fill our days are automated.
0~Warehouse in Oakland Fire Was Used Illegally~The fire that killed more than 30 people on Friday in Oakland occurred in a warehouse that was being used as an artistic and performance venue. The building, known as the Ghost Ship, also housed a community of roughly 25 artists who lived in the building even though it should not have had residents. Opening in wall Carmen Brito’s apartment Stairs Second floor performance space Stairs Entrance Entrance 31st Avenue Opening in wall Carmen Brito’s apartment Stairs Second floor performance space Stairs Entrance Entrance 31st Avenue The New York Times Carmen Brito, who lived in an apartment at the back of the first floor, said she thought the fire started in a studio next to hers. The warehouse had two floors and two entrances, and it was filled with vintage furniture, rugs and other objects, as well as musical instruments. Besides the front entrance on 31st Avenue, there was a side entrance that had been cut into the south wall that opened onto a vacant lot. There was also an opening in the north wall on the second floor that provided access to a bathroom in the adjacent building, according to Omar Vega, the owner of Custom O’s, an automotive shop on the first floor.

0~Naz Shah, British Lawmaker, Suspended Over Anti-Israel Posts~LONDON — In the face of mounting criticism over inaction on episodes of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn reversed himself on Wednesday and suspended a party lawmaker for endorsing anti-Israel posts on social media before she became a member of Parliament. The legislator, Naseem Shah, 42, also known as “Naz,” was elected last year in Bradford West, unseating George Galloway, a sharp critic of Israel who has himself been accused of anti-Semitism. Ms. Shah emerged from a tough childhood in Bradford that included a forced marriage, and has been considered a rising star in the Labour Party. As the scandal built, she resigned on Tuesday as parliamentary private secretary to John McDonnell, the party’s spokesman on the economy. Mr. Corbyn has been accused of not doing enough to combat anti-Semitism from Labour’s far left. He met earlier on Wednesday with Ms. Shah, who he said had issued a “full apology” for comments that “caused upset and hurt to the Jewish community.”
0~Famous, but Not Free~MULLENS, W.Va. — Christy Martin put a sweet tea and a Sprite on her tab at Second Street Station on a recent afternoon. She had only a $100 bill and didn’t want to trouble the waitress by asking her to break it. The restaurant knew Martin was good for it. Everyone in this former mining town knows her. Martin, 54, is largely credited with legitimizing female boxing in the modern era. The first female boxer to make the cover of Sports Illustrated, she went undefeated for a decade, achieving success but secretly living a tortured life. It was her second experience of fame — a terrifying, nearly fatal one — that finally set her free. Martin fought for the first time in a West Virginia “toughman” contest in 1987, the first year women were allowed to compete. She had never attended a professional fight, never been to a boxing gym or put on gloves, but she was a star basketball player in high school and college and decided to give it a shot. Martin easily won the contest. She continued to train and compete, and in 1991 teamed up with a trainer named Jim Martin. A year later, he proposed marriage. Soon Don King, the boxing promoter, came calling and put Martin on his cards.
0~Miami Mayor Tests Positive for Coronavirus~MIAMI — The scene was jarring: The mayor of a major American city communicated with the citizenry via video on a big screen at City Hall to deliver frightening news. He was placing himself in isolation in case he had contracted the coronavirus. By the next day, his test results were in. Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami became on Friday one of the first American elected officials to confirm he has Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Mr. Suarez, 42, was tested after having come in close contact earlier this week with a top adviser to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil who disclosed his coronavirus diagnosis on Thursday. A delegation from the South American country had visited Florida and also met with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate.

With some patience and attention, you can turn these opinions into a piece of written criticism: a review. Advice from experts might help. To support students who are interested in writing their own reviews, whether for our annual review contest or just for fun, we asked Times critics who work in four different genres to share their advice. In the four short videos below, you’ll learn more about how to explain your opinion, persuade a reader, consider a work’s context and examine the artist’s intent. For each video, we provide reflection questions to help students apply the advice to their own writing.
0~In Second Debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Spar in Bitter, Personal Terms~Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton collided in an almost unremittingly hostile debate on Sunday night, a 90-minute spectacle of character attacks, tawdry allegations, and Mr. Trump’s startling accusation that Mrs. Clinton had “tremendous hate in her heart.” In a remarkable political maneuver, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton had smeared women who accused her husband, Bill Clinton, of sexually assaulting or harassing them, seeking to salvage his presidential candidacy after explosive reports about his past lewd comments about women. Tense at first, and then increasingly angry as he grew more comfortable on the attack, Mr. Trump noted that three of Mr. Clinton’s accusers were sitting in the audience. It was one of several moments when Mr. Trump aimed to energize his most conservative supporters and drive a wedge between them and the elected Republican officials who have been abandoning him. He even threatened that if it were up to him, Mrs. Clinton would “be in jail” for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Both candidates were visibly uneasy throughout the debate, even refusing to shake hands at the beginning, as the town hall event unfolded on a small stage in a highly charged atmosphere. It was a deeply ugly moment in American politics, featuring the sort of personal invective rarely displayed by those who aspire to lead the nation.
0~Conservative Pennsylvania Congressman Resigns Amid Abortion Scandal~WASHINGTON — Representative Tim Murphy, an outspoken abortion opponent embattled by allegations that he encouraged his lover to terminate a pregnancy, announced Thursday that he would step down from his House seat this month. Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Thursday afternoon that Mr. Murphy, a Republican who has represented his conservative Pennsylvania district since 2003, had sent him a letter of resignation, effective Oct. 21. “It was Dr. Murphy’s decision to move on to the next chapter of his life, and I support it,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “We thank him for his many years of tireless work on mental health issues here in Congress and his service to the country as a naval reserve officer.” Less than 24 hours earlier, Mr. Murphy, 65, had announced that he would not seek re-election but would serve out his term. But he has faced an intensifying backlash over reports from The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he encouraged the woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair to have an abortion during an unfounded pregnancy scare.
0~Corrupt Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade~“You can’t go anywhere in Helmand now safely,” said Maj. Gen. Esmatullah Dawlatzai, who was recently put in charge of all the police forces in Helmand. “You can’t step outside of Lashkar Gah safely, and that’s a fact,” he added, referring to the provincial capital city. “It’s not going to change until we do something about the political corruption, which is being carried out from Kabul, and involves everyone: elders, parliament members, politicians, all of them,” General Dawlatzai continued. “The police, especially, are not a national police. They are not fighting for the benefit of their country, but for their patrons.” Mullah Majid Akhonzada, the deputy provincial chairman, said that all that Helmand got from Kabul was empty promises, as the Taliban gain more and more territory. “The fact is, nothing has been done except filling their own pockets,” he said. “That’s all they do.” Corruption does not just fatten up the skinny, it also undermines security. Hajji Ahmad is a provincial councilman from Gereshk District, the center of some of the fiercest fighting. “This is how it works,” he said. “The police chief buys his post, then he has to make his money back by selling other positions to other commanders, in the districts and subdistricts, and then those guys are selling to each checkpoint.” “So I’ll give you an example, a recent example of what happens,” Hajji Ahmad said. “In Margir area, at a police checkpost in Gereshk District, there’s 24 hours of fighting going on and at night the commander runs out of ammo. So he goes to his district commander and says, ‘We need ammo’, and the commander says, ‘Well, give me money so I can give you ammo.’ And he doesn’t have any money, so the Taliban overrun the checkpost and nine policemen are killed. That’s what happens.” He was referring to an attack that took place last month. The men appointed to reform the police and military in Helmand, General Dawlatzai and General Qahraman, are finding it hard going, and many of the obstacles are internal.
0~Vermont Can’t Shut Down Nuclear Plant, Judge Rules~The ruling is almost certain to be appealed by the state and an array of private groups that want the plant shut down because of leaks of radioactive tritium and other issues. Gov. Peter Shumlin said in a statement that he was “very disappointed” in the decision, adding, “I continue to believe that it is in Vermont’s best interest to retire the plant.” He said he would wait to hear from the state attorney general before commenting on an appeal. While a state decision to close a commercial reactor is very rare, the ruling was likely to resonate elsewhere. Referendums to force the closing of nuclear plants have been held in several states, including Maine, but none have passed. A California plant, Rancho Seco, in Sacramento, was closed by a referendum vote of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District in 1989, but the voters were also the plant’s owners. New York State prevented the Shoreham plant on Long Island from operating in the 1980s under an accord brokered by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo with the Long Island Lighting Company and others. His son, Andrew M. Cuomo, the current governor, is seeking to close the Indian Point nuclear plant 35 miles north of New York City, which is also owned and operated by Entergy. In 2002, when Entergy bought the Vermont plant from a group of local utilities that built it, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the state agreeing that it would need a state “certificate of public good” as well as the federal license extension to operate after March 21, 2012, when the license expires. The Legislature later reserved to itself the power to authorize the certificate, prompting the suit.
0~Florida Sees Signals of a Climate-Driven Housing Crisis~If rising seas cause America’s coastal housing market to dive — or, as many economists warn, when — the beginning might look a little like what’s happening in the tiny town of Bal Harbour, a glittering community on the northernmost tip of Miami Beach. With single-family homes selling for an average of $3.6 million, Bal Harbour epitomizes high-end Florida waterfront property. But around 2013, something started to change: The annual number of homes sales began to drop — tumbling by half by 2018 — a sign that fewer people wanted to buy. Prices eventually followed, falling 7.6 percent from 2016 to 2020, according to data from Zillow, the real estate data company. All across Florida’s low-lying areas, it’s a similar story, according to research published Monday. The authors argue that not only is climate change eroding one of the most vibrant real estate markets in the country, it has quietly been doing so for nearly a decade.
0~Cuomo, in State of State Speech, Unveils $20 Billion Housing Plan~Dick Dadey, the executive director of Citizens Union, a government watchdog group that has proposed several similar ethics reforms, said he hoped the scope of Mr. Cuomo’s proposals — touching on lobbying as well as voting, campaign finance as well as outside income — was an “indication of his strong commitment to getting at least some of these accomplished.” Mr. Dadey added that the combination of the current political climate and Mr. Cuomo’s proven ability to extract concessions from the Legislature made him optimistic that, if the governor wanted to, he could push his reforms through. Mr. Cuomo’s budget proposes to reduce the state’s spending on four-year colleges at CUNY by some $485 million — $240 million of which the state would put to a possible labor agreement with CUNY employees. Those so-called senior universities are currently financed by state money, financial aid and tuition; how the city would make up that $485 million is unclear. The budget also calls on the city to increase its contribution to growing Medicaid expenses, which had been frozen for several years. Mr. Cuomo, as he has in previous years, emphasized holding the line on spending. But, all told, the loss of CUNY funds and change to Medicaid could cost the city more than $500 million, said E. J. McMahon, president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, a conservative research group, who called such a move “indefensible.” “It’s one thing to actually cap spending,” Mr. McMahon said. “It’s another to shift it to your biggest locality.” Still, if Mr. de Blasio was upset he did not show it, declining to take a verbal swipe at the governor for the cost shifting.
0~The 10 Best Books of 2019~The Mexican author’s third novel — her first to be written in English — unfolds against a backdrop of crisis: of children crossing borders, facing death, being detained, being deported unaccompanied by their guardians. The novel centers on a couple and their two children (all unnamed), who are taking a road trip from New York City to the Mexican border; the couple’s marriage is on the brink of collapse as they pursue independent ethnographic research projects and the woman tries to help a Mexican immigrant find her daughters, who’ve gone missing in their attempt to cross the border behind her. The brilliance of Luiselli’s writing stirs rage and pity, but what might one do after reading such a novel? Acutely sensitive to these misgivings, Luiselli has delivered a madly allusive, self-reflexive, experimental book, one that is as much about storytellers and storytelling as it is about lost children.

0~Bryan Stevenson Wants the U.S. to Face Its History~Last year, you opened a national lynching memorial. What were you hoping to achieve? What we haven’t done in this country is create cultural spaces that expose people to the history of enslavement and lynching and segregation and motivate them to say, “Never again.” And if we make that commitment, then we’re going to be required to be more responsive when people say, “Well, those immigrants of color are unacceptable” or “Those people over there are unacceptable.” When we hear the echo of that narrative, I hope it motivates us to respond differently. You live in Montgomery, Ala., where both Confederate Memorial Day and Jefferson Davis’s birthday are state holidays and Martin Luther King Day is celebrated along with Robert E. Lee Day. How do you reconcile all that? It is unevolved to want to celebrate the architects and defenders of slavery. In Germany, there are no Adolf Hitler statues. They don’t want to embrace something so horrific. That’s not true in America. The landscape has become complicit in the way in which we have tolerated racial bias, so that has to change. There are things about which we can all feel proud. We can all honor, for example, the white people who were abolitionists in the 18th and the 19th centuries. And we can name some streets and schools and buildings after them, and all of us can celebrate those folks. That’s what we have to get to if we’re really serious about progressing past this history. What would the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. think about America if he was alive today? When he found out that one in three black male babies born in this country is expected to go to jail and prison, when he saw the level of poverty, when he heard some of the rhetoric that we frequently hear, I think he would be heartbroken. But I also think he would be excited that if he called a meeting, thousands would come. And that’s what has to happen, even without Dr. King — that we have to be willing to make that commitment so that we can create a world where if Dr. King emerged, he would be so proud to say his dream has finally been realized. We’re not in that world yet.
0~Judge Aaron Persky Under Fire for Sentencing in Stanford Rape Case~A California judge harshly criticized for giving what many say is a too-lenient sentence to a former Stanford student convicted of sexual assault has been bombarded by threats of violence against him and his family, an official said on Tuesday. The judge, Aaron Persky, 54, on Thursday sentenced the former student, Brock Allen Turner, 20, to six months in jail for three felony counts: intent to commit rape, sexual penetration with a foreign object of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration with a foreign object of an unconscious person. Threatening phone calls have flooded into the Santa Clara County Superior Court since then, said Gary Goodman, a supervising attorney for the county public defender’s office. “People have been calling the court and leaving messages, and if someone answers, they say, ‘Tell your judge he can go to hell, and I hope his kids get raped and he rots in hell,’ ” said Mr. Goodman, who has defended the judge. “He’s getting threats over this, him and his family, from all over the country. Is that right?”
0~Alexa, What Happens if the Echo Has a Screen? You Get This Review~You could also ask Alexa to place a call to another Echo customer. When I tried it, the Alexa app synchronized with my smartphone’s address book to determine who else was using an Echo. Then just by asking Alexa to call the name of a contact, I could immediately commence a video call. What was also nice about the Echo Show’s being stationary is that it remained fixed on a flattering angle of my face. (If you’re tired of staring up people’s nostrils on FaceTime calls, you’ll know what I mean.) There’s another task that the Echo Show handled better than the Echo speaker: shopping on Amazon. By saying, for example, “Alexa, order me some batteries,” you get the screen to show a list of batteries to choose from. By contrast, with the Echo speaker, the device could only reorder batteries you had bought before — or, if you hadn’t ordered batteries before, choose a pack of batteries for you. For audio, the Echo Show included two small stereo speakers. They sounded loud and clear but lacking in bass. Compared with fancy speakers, the Echo Show sounded average, but it’s adequate for watching YouTube videos in the kitchen or streaming music if you aren’t a nitpicky audiophile. Bugs and Quirks The Echo Show is buggy. In my tests with a fellow product reviewer as well as an Amazon spokesman, video calls were inconsistent. While video calls from my apartment looked clear and sounded good, other calls placed from the New York Times building failed to show any video — and, soon after, the calls disconnected. (In both locations, I used a strong Wi-Fi connection.) There were also some quirks with so-called Skills, which are essentially third-party apps that you can install to expand Alexa’s capabilities. For example, for looking up recipes in the kitchen, I tried a skill by AllRecipes. But when I told Alexa, “Show me how to make pasta,” the device loaded a list of recipes from AllRecipes.com, and then I had trouble quitting the app. The command “Go home” was supposed to quit the AllRecipes Skill, but it got stuck until I said, “Alexa, quit.”

0~Trump Speaks With Taiwan’s Leader, an Affront to China~WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with Taiwan’s president on Friday, a striking break with nearly four decades of diplomatic practice that could precipitate a major rift with China even before Mr. Trump takes office. Mr. Trump’s office said he had spoken with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, “who offered her congratulations.” He is believed to be the first president or president-elect who has spoken to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979, when the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People’s Republic of China. In the statement, Mr. Trump’s office said the two leaders had noted “the close economic, political, and security ties” between Taiwan and the United States. Mr. Trump, it said, “also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.” Mr. Trump’s motives in taking the call, which lasted more than 10 minutes, were not clear. In a Twitter message late Friday, he said Ms. Tsai “CALLED ME.”
0~Who Is Melissa DeRosa? Governor Cuomo's Top Aide~Competence is captivating. No need to tell viewers tuning in to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s daily media briefings. Many have been riveted by his plain talk in the face of a global pandemic. Others are increasingly focused on the woman usually seated at his left: the one who on a recent Thursday countered a reporter’s suggestion that New York had dragged its heels in response to the spread of the coronavirus by assuring him in a tone like flint that once it was clear that New York, and not just the West Coast, was an entry point for the virus, “we shut down fully, with literally zero guidance from the federal government.” She is Melissa DeRosa, the trusted aide and strategist to whom Mr. Cuomo routinely turns for a reliable litany of figures and facts: often seen taking notes, checking her cellphone and sliding relevant documents under the nose of her boss. A steady presence on the dais, Ms. DeRosa, 37, is having an extended breakout moment. As secretary to the governor, she is the most powerful appointed official in the state, the first woman to hold that position, and one of the youngest, her robust command of facts and arcana only hinting at her sway.
0~P.P.P. loan forgiveness portal opens, but big banks opt out.~In an effort to speed forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program loans, the government on Wednesday opened an online portal through which small businesses that borrowed up to $150,000 can apply to have their loans eliminated. The Small Business Administration, which administers the program, hopes the new system will streamline the process both for borrowers and for the program’s nearly 5,500 lenders, which collectively made 11.8 million government-backed loans totaling $800 billion between April 2020 and May 2021. Until now, each lender had to set up its own process for collecting loan forgiveness applications and sending them to the S.B.A. for approval. The new system “will simplify forgiveness for millions of our smallest businesses,” said Isabel Casillas Guzman, the agency’s administrator. About 92 percent of the program’s loans fall under the portal’s $150,000 cap. But there’s a sticking point: Lenders also have to agree to use the portal, otherwise the service won’t work for the borrower. So far, about 900 lenders have signed on, but many of the program’s largest lenders, especially big banks, are not on board. Several lenders said they preferred to stick with their own processes out of concern that steering customers to the S.B.A.’s portal would create confusion. Banks are also leery of relying on an agency that has struggled throughout the pandemic with buggy and overloaded technology systems. Many lenders “tested the portal’s capabilities during its early launch period and provided positive feedback,” said Matthew Coleman, an agency spokesman. JPMorgan Chase, the program’s largest lender, said it was “too early to say” whether it would participate in the portal. “We’re evaluating all aspects of the process and meanwhile continue to encourage our customers to apply for forgiveness through our platform,” said Elizabeth Seymour, a bank spokeswoman. Bank of America is also not participating at this time, a bank spokesman said. A few large lenders, though, are enthusiastic. Adam Seery, the chief operating officer of Harvest Small Business Finance, said his company hopes to use the new portal to process forgiveness applications for most of the 430,000 loans it made this year. “So far it’s a big success and will save months in processing times,” he said of the testing Harvest did over the last few weeks. Harvest submitted its first batch of around 30 applications this week and hopes to have those loans discharged soon. Nearly 80 percent of the 5 million P.P.P. loans given out last year have been fully or partially forgiven, according to the latest agency data, but very few of this year’s borrowers have begun the process. Most have until next year to seek forgiveness before they will be required to start making payments on their loans. Show more
0~Covid-19: F.D.A. Panel Gives Green Light to Johnson & Johnson’s Vaccine~Image Empty vials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at a hospital in South Africa. Credit... Phill Magakoe/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine was endorsed on Friday by a panel of experts advising the Food and Drug Administration, clearing the last hurdle before a formal authorization expected on Saturday, according to two people familiar with the agency’s plans. The nation’s first shipments will go out in the days after that. It will be the third shot made available to the United States in the year since the first surge of coronavirus cases began washing over the country, and it will be the first vaccine to require just one dose instead of two. Johnson & Johnson’s formulation worked well in clinical trials, particularly against severe disease and hospitalizations, even though it did not match the sky-high efficacy rates of the first two vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. The panel, made up of independent infectious disease experts, statisticians and epidemiologists, voted unanimously in favor of authorizing the vaccine. “We’re dealing with a pandemic right now,” said Dr. Jay Portnoy, an allergist at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., and a member of the board. “It’s great that we have this vaccine.” During Johnson & Johnson’s presentation to the panel, Dr. Gregory Poland, a virologist at the Mayo Clinic and a paid external consultant for the company, noted the vaccine’s efficacy, ease of use and low rate of side effects. It “nearly checks all the boxes,” he said. “To me, it is clear that the known benefits vastly outweigh the known risks.” The vaccine had an overall efficacy rate of 72 percent in the United States and 64 percent in South Africa, where a concerning variant emerged in the fall. The shot showed 86 percent efficacy against severe forms of Covid-19 in the United States, and 82 percent against severe disease in South Africa. Those are strong numbers, but lower than the roughly 95 percent efficacy rates of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines against mild, moderate and severe cases of Covid. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is a single dose and uses a different kind of technology than the authorized vaccines. And the scale and size of the Johnson & Johnson trial was vast, spanning eight countries, three continents and nearly 45,000 participants. Although the vaccine works with one shot, studies are underway to determine if a second dose would increase its protective effects. Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and one of the panelists, pointed out on Friday that in early clinical trials that took place over the summer, Johnson & Johnson found that a second dose led to levels of coronavirus antibodies that were almost three times higher than those produced by one dose alone. The results of Johnson & Johnson’s two-dose, late-stage clinical trial are not expected until July at the earliest. If those results turn out to be better than a single dose, Dr. Offit asked, “Does this then become a two-dose vaccine?” Dr. Johan Van Hoof, the global head of vaccine research and development at Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the drug development arm of Johnson & Johnson, said that the company decided to pursue the one-shot strategy after its studies on monkeys last spring showed that a single dose was enough to provide strong protection against the disease. “It’s clear that in a situation of an outbreak, in a raging epidemic, the big challenge is to get the epidemic under control,” he said. “The regimen is extremely well positioned to be used in outbreak situations.” But Dr. Van Hoof also noted that it will be important to track volunteers who received a single dose to see if their immunity changes in the months to come. It might be necessary to deliver a booster shot for long-term protection. “The big question mark still is, how long does protection last?” he said. After the vote, the F.D.A. told Johnson & Johnson that it “will rapidly work toward finalization and issuance of an emergency use authorization,” according to a statement. The F.D.A. also said that it had notified other government agencies “so they can execute their plans for timely vaccine distribution.”
0~Winning Because They Won’t Accept Losing~LONDON — If size or the weight of history were the sole determining factors in a soccer match, then you might wonder why Burkina Faso would even bother to turn up against Nigeria in the Africa Cup of nations final Sunday in Johannesburg. And if you do wonder, you have missed the point of the past three weeks. Burkina Faso has a population of about 17 million. Nigeria outnumbers it by nearly 10 to 1. The Burkinabé have no experience of soccer at this level, apart from one previous semifinal in 1998, and they have been dealt a poor hand at this tournament in South Africa. Each of Burkina Faso’s five games to the final has been played on a wretched field, unsuitable for top-class sport at Nelspruit — and that sand-based, bare, unpredictable field may well have contributed to some of the injuries it has picked up along the way. Furthermore, the African Confederation — the organizer of the competition — has admitted that the Tunisian referee Slim Jdidi, who punished Burkina Faso unduly in the semifinal that went into extra time Wednesday, fell below acceptable standards (he was suspended after the contest).
0~Jon Gruden Resigns After Homophobic and Mysogynistic Comments~In that email, Gruden, who is white and was working for ESPN at the time, criticized Smith’s intelligence and used a racist trope to describe his face. The correspondence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by The New York Times. Taken together, the emails provide an unvarnished look into the clubby culture of one N.F.L. circle of peers, where white male decision makers felt comfortable sharing pornographic images, deriding the league policies, and jocularly sharing homophobic language. Their banter flies in the face of the league’s public denouncements of racism and sexism and its promises to be more inclusive amid criticism for not listening to the concerns of Black players, who make up about 70 percent of rosters. The N.F.L. has in the past struggled to discipline personnel who have committed acts of domestic violence and been condemned for failing to adequately address harassment of women, including N.F.L. cheerleaders. The league, Smith and Davis all denounced Gruden’s comments about Smith when they surfaced, but the coach still led his team in its game on Sunday against the Chicago Bears. Gruden said Friday that he did not remember sending the email and that his language “went too far,” adding, “I never had a blade of racism in me.” Gruden's emails to Allen, who was fired by the Washington Football Team at the end of 2019, were reviewed as part of an N.F.L. investigation of workplace misconduct within the franchise that ended this summer. Goodell instructed league executives to look at more than 650,000 emails during the past few months, including those in which Gruden made offensive remarks. Last week, Goodell received a summary of their findings and the league sent the Raiders some of the emails written by Gruden. In the exchanges, Gruden used his personal email account while Allen wrote from his team account. In some cases, Allen initiated the conversations and Gruden chimed in, while in other cases, they trade vulgar comments several times.
0~An Upset in the Making: Why Joe Crowley Never Saw Defeat Coming~It was less than three weeks until Primary Day and, on first blush, the poll that Representative Joseph Crowley had been shown by his team of advisers was encouraging: He led his upstart rival, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, by 36 percentage points. It was the last poll Mr. Crowley’s campaign would conduct. Despite his many reputed strengths — his financial might as one of the top fund-raisers in Congress, his supposed stranglehold on Queens politics as the party boss, his seeming deep roots in an area he had represented for decades — Mr. Crowley was unable to prevent his stunning and thorough defeat on Tuesday night. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez bested Mr. Crowley by 15 percentage points, delivering a victory expected to make her, at 28, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. If it takes a perfect storm to dislodge a congressional leader, then Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her crusading campaign about class, race, gender, age, absenteeism and ideology proved to be just that. She and her supporters swept up Mr. Crowley in a redrawn and diversifying 14th Congressional District where the incumbent, despite two decades in Congress, had never run in a competitive primary.
0~Secret ‘Kill List’ Tests Obama’s Principles~Moreover, Mr. Obama’s record has not drawn anything like the sweeping criticism from allies that his predecessor faced. John B. Bellinger III, a top national security lawyer under the Bush administration, said that was because Mr. Obama’s liberal reputation and “softer packaging” have protected him. “After the global outrage over Guantánamo, it’s remarkable that the rest of the world has looked the other way while the Obama administration has conducted hundreds of drone strikes in several different countries, including killing at least some civilians,” said Mr. Bellinger, who supports the strikes. By withdrawing from Iraq and preparing to withdraw from Afghanistan, Mr. Obama has refocused the fight on Al Qaeda and hugely reduced the death toll both of American soldiers and Muslim civilians. But in moments of reflection, Mr. Obama may have reason to wonder about unfinished business and unintended consequences. His focus on strikes has made it impossible to forge, for now, the new relationship with the Muslim world that he had envisioned. Both Pakistan and Yemen are arguably less stable and more hostile to the United States than when Mr. Obama became president. Justly or not, drones have become a provocative symbol of American power, running roughshod over national sovereignty and killing innocents. With China and Russia watching, the United States has set an international precedent for sending drones over borders to kill enemies. Mr. Blair, the former director of national intelligence, said the strike campaign was dangerously seductive. “It is the politically advantageous thing to do — low cost, no U.S. casualties, gives the appearance of toughness,” he said. “It plays well domestically, and it is unpopular only in other countries. Any damage it does to the national interest only shows up over the long term.” But Mr. Blair’s dissent puts him in a small minority of security experts. Mr. Obama’s record has eroded the political perception that Democrats are weak on national security. No one would have imagined four years ago that his counterterrorism policies would come under far more fierce attack from the American Civil Liberties Union than from Mr. Romney. Aides say that Mr. Obama’s choices, though, are not surprising. The president’s reliance on strikes, said Mr. Leiter, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, “is far from a lurid fascination with covert action and special forces. It’s much more practical. He’s the president. He faces a post-Abdulmutallab situation, where he’s being told people might attack the United States tomorrow.” “You can pass a lot of laws,” Mr. Leiter said, “Those laws are not going to get Bin Laden dead.”
0~Trump Foments Protests Against Governors; Experts Warn of Testing Shortages~This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump calls to “LIBERATE” states where people are protesting social distancing restrictions. President Trump on Friday openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions in states with stay-at-home orders, a day after announcing guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables. In a series of all-caps tweets that started two minutes after a Fox News report on the protesters, the president declared, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” — two states whose Democratic governors have imposed strict social distancing restrictions. He also lashed out at Virginia, where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!” His stark departure from the more bipartisan tone of his announcement on Thursday night suggested Mr. Trump was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic, and choosing instead to divide the country by playing to his political base. Echoed across the internet and on cable television by conservative pundits and ultraright conspiracy theorists, his tweets were a remarkable example of a president egging on demonstrators and helping to stoke an angry fervor that in its anti-government rhetoric was eerily reminiscent of the birth of the Tea Party movement a decade ago.
0~Syrian Rebels Depart Homs District Under Deal~BEIRUT, Lebanon — Syria’s third-largest city, Homs, was one of the first to hold large demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad. Protesters there were among the first to take up arms against the state, and Homs neighborhoods were the first to suffer indiscriminate bombardment by government forces. Homs long stood as a bellwether for a nation slowly, brutally, unraveling. A diverse community increasingly split along sectarian lines as populations fled, neighborhoods were destroyed and rebels held out in the Old City. On Wednesday, the last insurgent-held neighborhoods of the Old City appeared to be falling to the government as the last fighters and their families began to evacuate under a deal freighted with symbolism for both sides. The government seeks to prove that through brute force and local talks, it can retake a major urban area. For its opponents, handing over enclaves that withstood a nearly two-year blockade is an emotional blow. But the deal was less than a full victory for the government, or a complete defeat for the rebels. The fighters were allowed to flee with light weapons to a safe haven where they vowed to continue the battle. The deal did little to head off the fragmentation of the country as both sides continue to refuse a broad negotiated settlement to a war that has taken more than 150,000 lives.
0~Why the Whole Trump-Clinton Election Could Probably Just Be Held in Pennsylvania~To answer your question directly, I am not compelled to buy or sell Clinton contracts (that pay off $1 if she wins) at $0.70 . Of course, that is because I trust my model. No More Waiting for Results on Election Day Q. What is your impression of the wisdom and fairness of doing live forecasting on Nov. 8? What if people hear results and decide to stay home? The Times reported recently on a plan that could permanently change the way Americans experience Election Day. The company spearheading the effort, VoteCastr, plans real-time projections of presidential and Senate races in Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It plans to publish a map and tables of its projected results on Slate, the online newsmagazine. A. PredictWise will have a lot of Election Day predictions that will approach 0 and 100 percent as the day unfolds. That is the nature of real-time updating market data that powers predictions. And I was happy to call the election for Obama well before 11 p.m. Eastern in 2012. I am not concerned about how the Slate-Votecastr plan will affect voting. Voting is a major cost for many Americans with hourly wage jobs. Those people who choose to get registered and vote are pretty committed to voting. They are more likely going to fixate on any projection that rationalizes voting than a particular projection that unmotivates them. If Slate reports the election is tight, people will use that to rationalize their decision to vote. If Slate reports that Clinton is winning, Clinton supporters will use that to rationalize winning big. And Trump’s supporters will turn to Fox News to confirm that Trump still has a strong chance and needs them more than ever. That is why Karl Rove was still predicting a Romney victory to the very end; he knew that some people just needed someone to convince them that it was worth the investment to stay in line to vote. The Ground Game Q. You have said that you expect prediction markets and polling averages to converge in the weeks leading up to the election, as they typically would, but with a possible exception this time around: the influence of the ground game. If the Trump campaign’s organization is poor and the prediction markets pick up on that, there could be a “rare divergence,” you said in one of your live Facebook chats. You gave an example earlier of how this could affect Pennsylvania. But how could markets discern something like poor campaign organization? A. The average of the polls near Election Day, for any given race, are off by two-three points on average, but we do not know which direction that will be. The error occurs because polls systemically undercount or overcount some groups of likely voters. On average, there is no bias for either the Democratic or Republican candidates. As a researcher, it has been very difficult to determine the effect of the campaigns, because all we get to witness is the net effect of both campaigns spending a fortune. But we are poised to witness the greatest imbalance ever in advertising and ground game spending. Clinton raised $143 million to Trump’s $90 million in August.
0~3 N.Y.P.D. Commanders Are Arrested in Vast Corruption Case~The other businessman, Jona S. Rechnitz, 33, has pleaded guilty and has provided information in the police case and in at least one of the fund-raising investigations focused on Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, and his inner circle, according to several people familiar with the case. Although the charges being leveled against the police commanders involve some of the same figures who appear in the mayoral fund-raising investigations — most notably Mr. Rechnitz — there has been no suggestion that the mayor himself was involved in the police influence-peddling and bribery scheme described in the court papers unsealed on Monday. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said little about the connection between the various inquiries, beyond noting that “there is no allegation that has anything to do with the mayor anywhere” in those court documents. Mr. Reichberg and Mr. Rechnitz do not appear to have had any official affiliation to the Police Department, although Mr. Reichberg, a member of the large Orthodox Jewish community in Borough Park, would often describe himself as a “community liaison” to the department. He even had business cards identifying him as such, prosecutors said.
0~Review: ‘The Passenger,’ by Cormac McCarthy~This first scene with Bobby Western is great, a reminder (just in time) of the elegance and force of good McCarthy. The whole setup is effective and creepy. It’s a frigid night in 1980, and a chartered plane has gone down in the Gulf of Mexico, not far from New Orleans. The team of divers to which Bobby belongs has been hired to go down and inspect. We observe the “tender,” the person who stays on the boat and directs the divers below: “The tender was lying on his elbows with the headset on watching the dark water beneath them. From time to time the sea would flare with a soft sulphurous light where forty feet down Oiler was working with the cuttingtorch. Western watched the tender and he blew on the tea and sipped it and he watched the lights moving along the causeway like the slow cellular crawl of waterdrops on a wire.” Slightly showy? If so, only with what Wallace Stevens called the “essential gaudiness” of the best poetry. The action passages underwater are also splendid. You are down there with them by the wreck, “the shape of the fuselage tunneling off into the dark.” You drift past “the hulking nacelles that held the turbofan engines” (nacelles: those streamlined shells around the engines, a surprisingly old word in English, 15th century, referring originally to a tiny ship). When the divers get into the plane, they find that one of the bodies is missing. There are eight passengers on the manifest but only seven on board. Has someone escaped, after first causing the crash? Or, even more ominous, has the site been visited already, and a body removed? Throughout much of the rest of the story, shadowy men who represent powerful agencies visit Bobby and rummage through his stuff, or threaten to rough him up. They think he knows something about the plane. They themselves either know something about it, or don’t and are frustrated by that. This state of affairs never quite rises to the level of plot, but it does establish paranoid atmosphere. Bobby and Alicia Western grew up together in east Tennessee. Their parents worked at Oak Ridge, where their father, a physicist, helped design and fabricate the atom bomb. He was a genius from the North, their mother a local. There is writerly self-mythologizing here, not in the sense of narcissism, but in the way that most writers turn the idiosyncratic facts of their biographies into maps of reality. McCarthy’s father, Charles — that’s Cormac’s real name, too — was likewise from the North, and came to east Tennessee in the employ of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federal agency that, in bringing electrical power to the rural South, had a hand in the erasure of swaths of that region’s folk culture. The T.V.A. also provided the power to the Oak Ridge facility, making possible certain atomic experiments of the early 1940s, the work that finally destroys the world in McCarthy’s Spenglerian-gothic vision (and in his apocalyptic road novel, “The Road”). The Westerns made me think about the real-life McCarthys and see them in a different light, a useful one, in grappling with the writer’s oeuvre. I hadn’t thought before about how other he had grown up. Irish Catholics in the mid-South, for starters; clearly the Westerns’ Jewishness stands in for the McCarthys’ Catholicism. His parents were well-educated Yankees (Cormac himself was born in Rhode Island) who lived in a nice house in a section strewn with shacks and sent the kids to parochial school. McCarthy’s mother, Gladys, hosted tea parties for Wellesley alumni. His pretty, thick-browed sisters won spelling bees and got scholarships to go elsewhere. They were aliens in that country. All of which makes it sort of marvelous that McCarthy inherited the mantle of the Great Southern Writer. His background doesn’t diminish the achievement. It may help to account for it some — dwelling in the midst of a society but seeing it from the outside, with heightened sensitivity and detached sensibility. On the other hand, The Knoxville Journal records that, as a boy, McCarthy was “accidentally shot in both legs” one night, as he and “another child were playing with an old .22 rifle,” so we know that local influences seeped in. Sense of place, as they say.
0~Violence Surged in N.Y.C. in 2020 Amid Pandemic and Protests~“There’s things that we probably should have done years and years ago,” Mr. Shea said, noting that the department had spent the months since June retraining many patrol officers and rethinking its approach to protests. Dozens of incidents were recorded of police officers brutalizing demonstrators, many of them peaceful, during protests. The state attorney general kicked off an investigation into the department’s aggressive enforcement. And earlier this month, a city watchdog chided police officials for being unprepared and out of touch with the current discourse about police brutality. Police officials in New York have pointed to gang disputes as a key driver of the violence over the summer, but several bystanders were caught in the cross hairs: a 43-year-old mother, killed by a stray bullet that went through her bedroom window in Queens; a man fatally shot on a handball court in Brooklyn; a 1-year-old boy, dead after a gunman opened fire on a cookout, also in Brooklyn. But many cases were stalled because the pandemic had forced the courts to operate virtually. Hardly any new trials were conducted, and the progress of many cases was significantly slowed. “I think we’ve struggled a little bit because of Covid, and how courts were closed, but when things start opening up, we have a lot of great work in the hopper ready to go, to really close some of the violence that we saw in 2020,” said Rodney Harrison, the Police Department’s chief of detectives. Combating street feuds has become a sort of routine for the police, particularly in the warmer months when turf battles and social media fights can lead to spikes in gun violence in certain neighborhoods. But officials and experts have said that something about the summer’s violence felt less predictable, and that made anticipating trends more difficult.
0~A Winning Baseball Novel by the Editor of The Paris Review~THE CACTUS LEAGUE By Emily Nemens There are probably more good novels about baseball than any other sport. More bad ones, too. Emily Nemens’s “The Cactus League” definitely belongs in that first lineup, though it’s unusual in at least two respects. The book is less a novel, really, than a series of very cleverly interlinked short stories. (There are nine, naturally, all set in Phoenix during the spring training — or Cactus League — season of 2011.) And very little ball actually gets played in them. Nemens’s real subject here is less the game of baseball itself, though she’s quite good at describing it, than its infrastructure, all the lives that professional baseball embraces. Her large cast includes a coach, some players, an owner, a physical therapist, an agent and his assistant, not to mention an organist, some people who run the concession stands, and the wives and the groupies — the middle-aged divorcées loitering by the parking lot in hopes of picking up a ballplayer for a night or two. The book’s plot, such as it is, concerns the unraveling of Jason Goodyear, a star outfielder for the Los Angeles Lions. (An annoying name, but if Nemens used a real one, she’d probably get sued.) He’s a two-time M.V.P., all-around good guy and straight arrow, “clean as a choirboy, quiet as a mouse” — think of somebody like Mike Trout, only with a secret gambling habit that has cost him his wife and his bank account. Jason is so broke he’s sleeping on a cot in the stadium supply shed. We know this from a middle-aged, out-of-work sportswriter who’s been hanging around the team, hoping for a scoop, and whose typed-up musings precede each of the book’s nine chapters. This guy is interested in what he calls the “long game” — so long that his descriptions include the ice age, the rise of the mastodons, the pulling apart of the continental shelf. Bad writing is hard to do entertainingly, and while some of this stuff is sort of funny, much of it is just tiresome — Nemens’s one serious misstep. Goodyear’s plight is actually less interesting than that of Greg Carver, a pitcher who is 27 (almost middle-aged in baseball years) and just coming off Tommy John surgery. That’s the operation that replaces a blown-out arm ligament with a transplanted tendon. It often works wonders but requires a full year of rehab, and even after a whole season off Greg is still in pain. He can get through a game only by popping Vicodins — vikings, as they’re called in the locker room — which cause him to space out on the mound, forgetting where he is. It’s not giving away too much to say that he won’t make it through the spring. Neither will 18-year-old William Goslin, whose great-great-uncle is the Hall of Famer Goose Goslin. William is a bonus baby — he signed for $2 million right out of high school — and now he finds himself way out of his league, both athletically and emotionally. He spends most of his time alone in his hotel room, ordering meals from room service, playing Xbox games and dodging phone calls from his mother. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of February. See the full list. ] Some of Nemens’s best characters, however, aren’t ballplayers at all. There’s a homeless family, for example — a single mom and two kids — squatting in a half-finished house abandoned during the Phoenix housing crash of 2008 while the mother tries to put takeout food on the table (and also tend to her drug habit) by selling hot dogs at the stadium. Another squatter, in a house owned by a developer boyfriend, is one of the groupies, Tami Rowland. She works part time at Taliesin West, Frank Lloyd Wright’s winter home, now a museum, but her real passion is sleeping with ballplayers. Now in her 40s, with two marriages behind her, her body starting to show its age, she’s at once the most knowing and cynical character in “The Cactus League” — she’s onto all the scams, all the lies people tell one another — and the most hopeful. She really loves baseball and the men who play it, not just for their sexiness but for what they represent. “In a lot of ways, baseball players are like other men,” she thinks. “Some of them are dummies, some of them are mad, some of them are suspicious, shallow, arrogant. … But the difference separating ballplayers from everyone else is that they care about something tremendously and have since they were little. It’s thrilling. … Most people will never touch that kind of drive.”
0~A Wild West Story About the Early Internet and Sex.com~THE PLAYERS BALL A Genius, a Con Man, and the Secret History of the Internet’s Rise By David Kushner In “The Players Ball,” David Kushner’s lively re-enactment of the battle to control the web address sex.com, the internet gets the creepy, disturbing origin story that it deserves. Some may prefer to trace the internet’s rise to the wizards who stayed up late connecting computer centers across the globe or to the bookish Tim Berners-Lee weaving the World Wide Web from his Swiss lab, but the unsavory characters at the heart of “The Players Ball” are a better fit for today. Stephen Michael Cohen and Gary Kremen spent the better part of the 1990s fighting for custody of sex.com, which raked in as much as $5 million a year in profits by serving as a hub for porn ads and subscriptions. In the process, they proved that with the right stimulus, crowds would flock online and spend freely. “As in the American Frontier of the 1800s, the early settlers of the net fought to stake their claim and make their millions,” Kushner writes at the start of the book. “They established the systems that defined the world to come. But none of this would have been possible without the fuel that made the internet what it is today, love and sex.” In other words, once there was money to be made from porn, the trappings of civilization were certain to follow — infrastructure investments, legal protections and the like. This comparison between the early internet and the Wild West — mythologized as virgin territory waiting to be conquered by visionary men — is hardly unique to Kushner. One of the first important digital rights groups, for example, named itself the Electronic Frontier Foundation. But Kushner, who is the author of several books including a history of the video game Grand Theft Auto, leans especially heavily on the tropes of the western, building his story around a white hat (Kremen) and black hat (Cohen).
0~Nintendo Switch Reaches for a New Market With Home-and-Mobile Console~SEATTLE — Throughout its history, Nintendo has alternated between bursts of innovation that redefined gaming and slumps where it fell behind rivals after misjudging trends. Now the company has revealed a big part of its plan for regaining its leadership in gaming. The Japanese game giant provided the first look at a new console it is developing that will do double-duty as a portable game system outside the home and one that will serve in the traditional role, connected to television sets. Other game companies have toyed around with similar approaches in the past with limited success, but the Nintendo Switch, as the device is called, is the first from a marquee games company to so assertively seek to erase the boundaries between home and mobile gaming. “Nintendo Switch allows gamers the freedom to play however they like,” Reggie Fils-Aimé, the president and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America, said in a statement. “It gives game developers new abilities to bring their creative visions to life by opening up the concept of gaming without boundaries.”
0~Los últimos días de Jeffrey Epstein, el prisionero 76318-054~El 9 de agosto, los abogados de Epstein estaban reunidos en las sillas plásticas de la sala de reuniones cuando se corrió la voz: el tribunal del caso en contra de Epstein había liberado el acceso a un archivo de documentos con detalles perturbadores sobre las acusaciones contra el financiero por tráfico sexual. Unas horas después, en el turno nocturno, solo había dieciocho personas trabajando como guardias en el centro, donde están detenidos 750 reos según los registros del Buró de Prisiones. Diez de esos empleados ya estaban trabajando horas extra. Y, según los registros, había un puesto sin cubrir. En la unidad 9 South, donde estaba Epstein, había dos guardias; uno de ellos era un exfuncionario correccional que se había ofrecido a hacer el turno de modo voluntario. [El narcotraficante mexicano Joaquín “el Chapo” Guzmán estuvo en la misma cárcel de Manhattan por un tiempo; el sitio ha sido calificado como “peor que Guantánamo”.] Los dos guardias tendrían que haber revisado la celda de Epstein cada media hora, pero no lo hicieron durante tres horas. En algún momento, ambos se quedaron dormidos, según dos oficiales del Buró de Prisiones. A la mañana siguiente, Epstein, de 66 años, estaba muerto. A las 6:30 fue encontrado por al menos uno de los guardias en la celda, inconsciente y con la piel azulada por falta de oxígeno, después de haberse colgado con una de las sábanas, de acuerdo con un oficial de la prisión y con un funcionario policial. Uno de los empleados activó la alarma para alertar de una emergencia, según un oficial. Empezaron a sonar las radios: “Alerta por cuerpo en South”.

Candidates are already looking toward New Hampshire. archived recording (bernie sanders) Let me take this opportunity — To thank the people of New Hampshire for a great victory tonight. archived recording Moderate candidates, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar trailed Sanders to round up — [music] archived recording Breaking news from the Democratic presidential race, where a national poll out this morning shows the former New York mayor is now in second place with 19% support behind Bernie Sanders. Michael Bloomberg, whose rise in the polls is fueled by more than $300 million in ad spending. Mayor Bloomberg has not appeared on a single debate stage or a single ballot, but that will change tonight. alex burns It’s Alex Burns in Las Vegas, where Wednesday night’s Democratic debate was held ahead of the Nevada caucuses this weekend. [music] archived recording From NBC news, the Democratic Presidential Debate, live from Las Vegas, Nevada. alex burns This was a debate we were all really waiting for because it was first time Mayor Bloomberg has appeared on the stage. And really, it’s the first time he has engaged with other Democratic candidates at all since entering the race. Polls released over the last few days have shown Bloomberg overtaking Joe Biden, nationally, as the moderate runner-up to Bernie Sanders, the front runner, thanks to hundreds of millions of dollars that Bloomberg has poured into advertising. But for most Americans, this was the first time that they have really been introduced to the man himself. So going in, we knew that all the other candidates were going to try to make that a rough introduction to scuff up the glossy image of himself that Bloomberg puts in TV ads. And right away, they did. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I think we need something different than Donald Trump. I don’t think you look at Donald Trump and say, we need someone richer in the White House. archived recording (lester holt) Thank you. Mayor Bloomberg — archived recording (elizabeth warren) Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk. archived recording (joe biden) Stop-and-frisk. archived recording (bernie sanders) Stop-and-frisk, which went after African-American and Latino people in an outrageous way. archived recording (joe biden) Throwing close to five million young black men up against the wall. archived recording (bernie sanders) That is not a way you’re going to grow voter turnout. alex burns They, of course, went after stop-and-frisk, his invasive policing policy as mayor of New York. archived recording (lester holt) Mayor Bloomberg, at the beginning of this debate, you took some incoming fire on this next topic, so let’s get into it. At 2015, this is how you described your policing policy as mayor. Quote, “We put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods.” And you explain that is, quote, “because that’s where all the crime is.” alex burns And early on, NBC moderator, Lester Holt, asked Bloomberg to address it. archived recording (lester holt) You went on to say, “And the way you should get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them against the wall and frisk them.” You’ve apologized for that policy. But what does that kind of language say about how you view people of color or people in minority neighborhoods? archived recording (michael bloomberg) Well, if I go back and look at my time in office, the one thing that I’m really worried about, embarrassed about was how it turned out with stop-and-frisk. And we started a — we adopted a policy, which had been in place, the policy that all big police departments use — of stop-and-frisk. What happened, however, was it got out of control. alex burns From the beginning, he struggled with his responses. archived recording (michael bloomberg) And we have to keep the lid on crime. But we cannot go out and stop people — archived recording (lester holt) All right, mayor. archived recording (michael bloomberg) — indiscriminately. archived recording (lester holt) Mayor, thank you. Let me go to — alex burns This was the number one question that Bloomberg would have known was coming. More than any other policy issue, this is the one his campaign has worried about from the start of the race. But — archived recording (michael bloomberg) I’ve sat. I’ve apologized. I’ve asked for forgiveness. But the problem — alex burns Bloomberg is a man known for his political agility, or his comfort expressing contrition, or for his thick skin. And it showed. archived recording (michael bloomberg) And if we took off everybody that was wrong off this panel, everybody that was wrong on criminal justice at some time in their careers, there’d be nobody else up here. alex burns And the attacks were just sort of unrelenting. Up until this point, Elizabeth Warren has mostly avoided direct confrontation in debates with other candidates. She has been calling herself, “the unity candidate.” But she took a totally different approach, a far more aggressive approach. And Mike Bloomberg was her favorite target. archived recording (elizabeth warren) I’d like to talk about who we’re running against. alex burns She landed some of the most stinging blows in the debate, drawing a connection between Bloomberg and public enemy number one for the Democrats. archived recording (elizabeth warren) A billionaire who calls women, “fat broads” and “horse-faced lesbians.” And no, I’m not talking about Donald Trump; I’m talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to win — alex burns Perhaps, the most contentious exchange of the night, and the toughest one for Bloomberg, was a lengthy back and forth between him and both Warren and Joe Biden about a number of women who have signed nondisclosure agreements with Bloomberg and his company. archived recording (elizabeth warren) He has gotten some number of women — dozens? who knows — to sign nondisclosure agreements both for sexual harassment and for gender discrimination in the workplace. So Mr. Mayor, are you willing to release all of those women from those nondisclosure agreements so we can hear their side of the story? [APPLAUSE] archived recording (michael bloomberg) We have a very few nondisclosure agreements. archived recording (elizabeth warren) How many is that? archived recording (michael bloomberg) Let me finish. archived recording (elizabeth warren) How many is that? archived recording (michael bloomberg) None of them accused me of doing anything other than — maybe they didn’t like the joke I told. And let me just point — [CROWD MURMURING] — and let me point — those would be agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet. And that’s up to them. They signed those agreements, and we’ll live with it. alex burns Warren challenged him over and over to release those women from the NDAs and let them speak openly about their experiences. archived recording (elizabeth warren) And when you say they signed them, and they wanted them. If they wish now to speak out and tell their side of the story about what it is they allege, that’s now OK with you? You’re releasing them on television tonight? archived recording (michael bloomberg) Senator, no. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Is that right? alex burns Bloomberg said he would not do it. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Tonight? archived recording (michael bloomberg) Senator, the company and somebody else, in this case — the man or a woman, or could be more than that, they decided when they made an agreement, that they wanted to keep it quiet for everybody’s interest. archived recording (elizabeth warren) No. archived recording (joe biden) Come on. archived recording (michael bloomberg) They signed the agreements. And that’s what we’re going to live with. archived recording (elizabeth warren) I’m sorry. No. The question is — archived recording (michael bloomberg) I heard your question. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — are the women bound by — alex burns But the latest is what these attacks reflect about the state of the Democratic race and the urgency that the candidates are feeling in this moment. Bernie Sanders’s lead is looking increasingly strong heading into the Nevada caucuses. And as we’ve talked about many times, part of that has to do with the fact that the more moderate candidates are dividing the votes amongst themselves, making it harder for any one of them to emerge as a clear alternative to Sanders. Now, in comes Michael Bloomberg with all of his money and his power and name recognition. But so far, he has done more to slow down fellow moderates than to thwart Bernie Sanders. archived recording (pete buttigieg) Senator, when you say that you disowned these attacks, and you didn’t personally direct them, I believe you. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, thank you. archived recording (pete buttigieg) But at a certain point, you got to ask yourself, why did this pattern arise? Why is it especially the case among your support? archived recording (bernie sanders) I don’t think it is especially the case, by the way. archived recording (pete buttigieg) That’s just not true. Look — archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, people know — alex burns And so that meant it wasn’t just Bloomberg on the defensive. The other Democrats also had to take on Sanders, himself. archived recording (michael bloomberg) What a wonderful country we have. The best-known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses. What’d I miss here? [CROWD MURMURING] archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, you’ll miss that I work in Washington, house one. archived recording (michael bloomberg) That’s the first problem. archived recording (bernie sanders) Live in Burlington, house two. alex burns And they had to take on each other. archived recording (pete buttigieg) Of the country to ourself. archived recording (amy klobuchar) Are you trying to say that I’m dumb? Or are you mocking me here, Pete? archived recording (pete buttigieg) I’m saying that you shouldn’t trivialize — archived recording (amy klobuchar) I said I made — alex burns There was more open hostility, more personal bitterness in this two-hour debate than in perhaps all the other debates combined. And that’s because the stakes for the candidates are higher now. And for many of them, really for almost all of them, time may be close to running out. [music]
0~SUNY Withdraws Development Plan for Troubled Brooklyn Hospital~The State University of New York on Tuesday withdrew a plan to build condominiums on the property of the troubled Long Island College Hospital, after dozens of angry protesters complained that the community had not been consulted. As the protesters shouted, “Just wait for the new mayor!” and “Just one month!” the university’s trustees, meeting in Midtown Manhattan, began expressing doubts about the development plan that a screening panel had favored. One trustee, Joseph W. Belluck, said that in light of the community opposition, he did not think he could support it. Another, Richard Socarides, suggested letting the incoming mayor, Bill de Blasio, deal with the hospital, noting that Mr. de Blasio, had “expressed a keen interest in this matter.” H. Carl McCall, chairman of the SUNY board of trustees and a former state comptroller, acidly replied, “A real profile in courage.”
0~What You Need to Know Now About Travel Insurance~“People who are traveling are more conscious of their risks and thinking about protecting themselves and their investment,” said Jeremy Murchland, the president of the travel insurer Seven Corners. The company launched policies that included Covid-19 coverage in June; they now account for more than 80 percent of sales. But, like all insurance, the devil is in the details when it comes to understanding travel insurance, including what’s covered, destinations where it’s required, and the inevitable caveats, as follows. How travel insurance covers Covid-19 The new Covid-inclusive insurance generally covers travelers from the day after purchase until their return home. During that period, if you become sick and a doctor determines you cannot travel (because of the virus or another illness), trip cancellation and trip interruption benefits would kick in. These benefits vary by policy, but a search to insure a $2,000 weeklong trip to Costa Rica in December on Travelinsurance.com turned up a $69.75 Generali Global Assistance Standard policy with Covid-19 benefits that would be triggered if you, your host at your destination, a travel companion or a family member tested positive for the virus. If this happened before your departure, the policy would cover your prepaid travel expenses. If you or your travel companion contracted Covid-19 during the trip and were diagnosed by a physician, it would reimburse prepaid arrangements, such as lodgings, and cover additional airfare to return home — once a doctor deems it safe to travel — up to $2,500. Should you be required to quarantine and can’t travel, travel delay coverage for lodging, meals and local transportation would pay up to $1,000. The policy also covers medical expenses for up to one year, even after you return home, up to $50,000 — though the policy also states that a holder would have to exhaust their own health insurance benefits before seeking coverage under the travel insurance plan.
0~Trump Threatens Federal Intervention in Chicago, Citing ‘Carnage’~President Trump threatened federal intervention in Chicago on Tuesday night if the city does not do more to address violent crime, resurfacing a criticism he made during the presidential campaign. “If Chicago doesn’t fix the horrible ‘carnage’ going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!” he said on Twitter just before 9:30 p.m. The tweet came after the evening broadcast on Fox News of “The O’Reilly Factor,” which featured a segment in which the host, Bill O’Reilly, explored whether and how the federal government could intervene in combating violent crime by having federal authorities prosecute some cases or calling in the National Guard.
0~Trump’s Policy Could Alter the Face of the American Immigrant~“This was a very highly calibrated attempt to increase European immigration,” said Muzaffar Chishti, the director of the Migration Policy Institute’s office at New York University School of Law. “It just did not work out that way,” he said. Instead, a confluence of factors including rising quality of life in Europe, advancements in transportation technology and the end of colonial rule in countries in South and East Asia had unforeseen consequences. Europeans became less interested in American immigration, while instead the United States ushered in scores of others — Indian students, Filipino nurses, entrepreneurs from Hong Kong — who, in turn, petitioned to bring their family members behind them. As a result, while 85 percent of immigrants in the United States in 1960 were of European origin and 15 percent came from elsewhere in the world, Mr. Chishti said, today the reverse is true. The way that means testing tends to favor immigrants from Europe and Canada already has become apparent over the past year as State Department consular officials began evaluating visas on the basis of whether applicants are likely to be heavy users of government benefits. Visa denials increased across the board, according to a report by Politico, particularly in less developed and impoverished countries. The data obtained by the news organization showed steep increases in visa denials for countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In Mexico, visa denials jumped to 5,343 during 10 months of 2018 and 2019, up from seven in all of 2016. Tammy Fox-Isicoff, a Miami lawyer, said that an American-citizen client, an entrepreneur with an MBA, petitioned for his parents, 60 and 65 years old, who are both healthy and hold engineering degrees, to immigrate to the United States from Uzbekistan. Despite the fact that he presented proof of $470,000 in assets, his parents were denied immigrant visas based on the “totality of circumstances,” according to correspondence reviewed by The New York Times. The consular officers required $1 million in assets from their son to reconsider the case. “They are making it really hard for American citizens to sponsor parents. Most of them are going to be over 60, at the very least,” Ms. Fox-Isicoff said.
0~The New Zealand Attack Posed New Challenges for Journalists. Here Are the Decisions The Times Made.~“Instead, you have someone who designed a horrific terrorist attack using all of the power of social media and the internet to spread his vile views,” he said. “So for us, it was how do you cover it in that context, how do we understand it and explain it, and how do we avoid becoming the tools of a terrorist?” How did the unusual nature of the attack change The Times’s calculations around how to cover it? Our editors often have to decide if we should publish disturbing images or videos from shootings, bombings and war. They must weigh an image’s news value and our mission to inform the public about the horrors of an attack against how intrusive the image is and how upsetting it could be for our readers or those affected by the tragedy to see it. “We have to have a real reason for showing these things,” said Mark Scheffler, our deputy editor of video. The video or images must be used “to tell a broader story, not just to say, ‘Here’s video of this guy’s shooting spree.’” [Read about a recent debate among our readers and in our newsroom over whether we should have published graphic photographs after a deadly attack in Nairobi.] This case was different because the person who shot the video was not an eyewitness, journalist or member of law enforcement. It was the attacker himself. “Here, the fact that the video was made by the killer added a whole other dimension to it,” said Phil Corbett, our associate managing editor for standards. “You have this additional factor of, Are you going to help publicize this terrorist video that the killer has made himself, obviously with the intent of it being seen as widely as possible? That made all of us even more cautious and wary about whether we would use any images.” Ultimately our editors decided not to run any of the gunman’s video of the attack or even link to it.
0~70 Percent of Adults in Europe Have Been Fully Vaccinated~Around 70 percent of adults in the European Union have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, E.U. officials said on Tuesday, a milestone that puts the bloc among the world’s leaders in vaccinations despite a sluggish start earlier this year and worrying discrepancies among member states. After a fumbling start, the European Union overtook the United States in vaccinations last month, as campaigns taken together across the bloc’s 27 countries grew at a faster pace than anywhere else in the world. Tuesday’s announcement marked the meeting of a self-set deadline that once seemed far out of reach. While the vaccination rate has slowed this month, it has yet to reach a ceiling that some experts and officials feared it would hit over the summer. Taking children and teenagers into account, more than 55 percent of the overall E.U. population has been fully vaccinated, compared with 52 percent in the United States, 61 percent in Israel, and 64 percent in Britain.
0~Rupert Murdoch's Biggest Gamble~Still, one thing is predictable. As he prepares to turn 60 in March, Murdoch is confronting his own mortality. An old friend, the British publisher Paul Hamlyn, says that because Murdoch's father died young of a heart attack, ''Rupert always thought he might die young, so everything has to be done fast.'' Now he is trying to insure that his hectic accumulation of assets will be in safe hands, even without him. Already this year, Murdoch has increased the number of annual board meetings from one to four. Moreover, he has installed his wife, Anna, a novelist, as a board member. ''It's time for a little discipline,'' he says. ''I am nearly 60 and she is 13 years younger than me. And, if something happened to me, it would be a few years before any of the children who would be likely to want to come in would be ready for it. I guess it's a defensive thing to have a member of the family on the board.'' Murdoch has three children by Anna - Elisabeth, 22; Lachlan, 19, and James, 17. His eldest child, Prudence, by his first marriage, is not interested in executive responsibility at News. At the same time, Murdoch is speaking openly about his successor: Andrew Knight. ''I don't intend to go under a bus tomorrow,'' Murdoch says, ''but if I did, probably Andrew Knight would become the chief executive. He is the most rounded, the most international, with the most journalist-based skills.'' Knight, now 50 and a former editor of The Economist and The Daily Telegraph, has been with News less than a year, but he has a reputation for toughness and shrewdness - he turned The Telegraph from a loss-maker to a major money-spinner. One person familiar with the company and close to Murdoch says: ''What he is doing is creating an insurance system. He wants to be able to sleep easily at night. But he believes he will go on for years, and one day, one of his children will take over.'' But what will his children find? It is possible to paint a very bleak scenario for News: a continuing worldwide advertising slump; higher interest rates, particularly in the United States, where News has most of its debt; a sudden success for BSB combined with problems for Sky; a Labor Party victory in Britain and an ensuing campaign against his cross-media holdings; an Australian recession; regulatory problems for Fox in its bid to be effectively a network while continuing to syndicate its own shows. On the other hand, the outlines of a genuine global communications network are coming into focus. Fox has moved firmly into the black this year, and other American television executives are talking enviously of its young viewership, which is the most attractive to advertisers. Meanwhile, Sky is showing signs of life. Already, Murdoch can take a hit show like ''The Simpsons'' from Fox TV, put it in book form through HarperCollins, in movie form through 20th Century Fox, pass it along to Sky TV in Britain, and serialize it in newspapers and magazines throughout the world. With the notable exception of The New York Post, and his 1983 purchase of the ''Hitler Diaries,'' which turned out to be fake, most of Murdoch's shots have been on target. The businesses he has acquired or started have grown enormously in value. For example, he bought The Village Voice and New York magazine for $17 million in 1977. In 1985, he sold The Voice for $55 million, and New York is now worth at least $200 million. As a result of such coups, News Corporation has a breakup value of more than $20 billion - useful insurance, especially with his annual interest payments running at $800 million. But if the television operations really come good, Murdoch's juggling act could become less frenetic, less alarming to behold. News Corporation, with its properties in every medium all over the world, would then stand prepared - perhaps more than its cautious competitors - for the Golden Age of Information that Murdoch sees looming in the 21st century.
0~C.D.C.’s ‘Clarification’ on Coronavirus Testing Offers More Confusion~Democrats including the governors of California and New York as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi have accused the C.D.C. of bowing to political pressure from President Trump, who wants to minimize the number of cases of infection. Administration officials say the guidelines were the product of a vigorous debate in the White House coronavirus task force. In his statement, Dr. Redfield sought to explain: “Testing is meant to drive actions and achieve specific public health objectives. Everyone who needs a Covid-19 test can get a test. Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test; the key is to engage the needed public health community in the decision with the appropriate follow-up action.” The clarification does not change the new guidelines, which remain on the C.D.C.’s website. But it is unusual. Public health experts say clear, consistent communications are essential to fighting an infectious disease outbreak, and in interviews several said that statements from the C.D.C. and Dr. Redfield had fallen far short of that goal. “What we need from the C.D.C. is clear, specific, directive guidance,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a former health commissioner of Baltimore. “It shouldn’t be a Rorschach blot that we’re looking at, and everybody’s getting a different response by looking at the same guidance.” Dr. Wen said she was concerned about the effect of the rule on insurance coverage for testing. Insurers have been chafing against the mandate to pay for all tests without requiring a co-payment from patients. Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, said the new guidance suggested the administration was “not going to support asymptomatic testing with new money or allow Medicaid to pay for it.”
0~War Crimes Report on Yemen Accuses Saudi Arabia and U.A.E.~“We determined it was the right thing to do in defense of their own countries, but also to restore the rightful government there,’’ he told reporters. “Our conduct there is to try to keep the human cost of innocents being killed accidentally to an absolute minimum.’’ The American goal, Mr. Mattis said, is to encourage the combatants to negotiate a settlement to the conflict. Tawakkol Karman, a Yemeni human rights activist who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011, responded to Mr. Gargash, the Emirati foreign affairs minister on Twitter. She said the United Nations report would not be credible unless it cited the leaders of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as well as the head of the Houthi movement, as responsible for the civilian massacres. Political factions and militias have been fighting for control of Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, since power-sharing talks collapsed in 2014 and the Houthis ousted the internationally backed government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Since then, fighting has devolved into proxy warfare, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates arming and fighting alongside a disparate group of Islamist, tribal and regional militias against the Houthis, who control Sana, the capital, as well as the major port of Al Hudaydah and their ancestral territories along the Saudi border. The Saudis and their allies have accused Iran of aiding the Houthis. Iran has denied involvement, despite evidence that the rebels are using Iranian weaponry, including missiles. The report accused the Saudi-led coalition of routinely having failed to consult its own “no-strike list” of more than 30,000 sites in Yemen, including refugee camps and hospitals. It also said the Saudi Air Force had not cooperated with investigators about its targeting procedures.
0~Cigna to Buy Express Scripts in $52 Billion Health Care Deal~The health insurance giant Cigna said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, in a $52 billion deal that could further reshape the roiling health care landscape. The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidations that is sweeping through the health care industry. Companies are reacting to concerns over rising health care costs and the possibility of powerful new rivals entering the fray. In particular, Amazon’s move into the health care business has forced established companies to rethink how they can compete. Cigna and Express Scripts said the acquisition would benefit consumers by allowing the two companies to bring together patients’ medical and pharmacy histories to improve treatments and lower costs. “This step furthers our strategy to improve the affordability and value to the consumer in a more personalized way,” said Cigna’s chief executive, David Cordani, who will serve as chief executive for the combined company.
0~In Arizona, a Swing State Swings to the Far Right~SIERRA VISTA, Ariz. — Kari Lake has a strategy to get elected in 2022. Keep talking about 2020. Minutes into her pitch at the Cochise County Republican headquarters in the suburbs of southern Arizona, Ms. Lake zeroed in on the presidential election 18 months ago, calling it “crooked” and “corrupt.” She claimed nearly a dozen times in a single hour that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald J. Trump, a falsehood that the audience — some of whom wore red hats reading “Trump Won” — was eager to hear. Ms. Lake, a former local Fox anchor who won Mr. Trump’s endorsement as she campaigns to become Arizona’s next governor, calls the 2020 election a key motivation in her decision to enter the race. “We need some people with a backbone to stand up for this country — we had our election stolen,” Ms. Lake said in an interview after the Cochise County event in March, adding, “I don’t know if it’s a winning issue, but it’s a winning issue when it comes to saving this country.” Republicans in many states have grown increasingly tired of the Stop the Steal movement and the push by Mr. Trump to reward election deniers and punish those who accept President Biden’s victory. At a time when Mr. Biden’s approval ratings are sinking, leaders in the party are urging candidates to focus instead on the economy, inflation and other kitchen-table issues. But 12 weeks before its Republican primary in August, Arizona shows just how firm of a grasp Mr. Trump and his election conspiracy theories still have at every level of the party, from local activists to top statewide candidates. And this week’s victory for J.D. Vance, the “Hillbilly Elegy” author who received the former president’s endorsement in the Republican primary for an Ohio Senate seat, shows that loyalty to Trumpism goes a long way in battleground states.

The European Union has become a focus of populist anger, further constraining options. And Germany has opposed bailouts for lenders in other lands, making a Deutsche rescue politically radioactive.

Institutions that trade with Deutsche would feel an urge to collect their cash immediately. Given the scale of the bank’s balance sheet — 1.8 trillion euros, or more than $2 trillion — that inclination is likely to spread to every crevice of finance. Economies would grind to a halt. Jobs and fortunes would disappear. Image “Rumors are causing significant swings in our stock price,” John Cryan, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, said on Friday. “It is our task now to prevent distorted perception from further interrupting our daily business.” Credit... Daniel Roland/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Despite murmurings in pundit quarters that this sort of situation may be unfolding, provoking comparisons with the catastrophic bankruptcy of the American investment banking giant Lehman Brothers eight years ago, most economists dismiss such talk as overwrought and overblown. Deutsche is sitting on cash reserves worth €240 billion, or about $269 billion. It has sold bonds that can be converted to equity should the need arise. The Justice Department’s proposed fine of $14 billion is viewed as the opening of a negotiation that could cost Deutsche a fraction of that amount — thinking that sent the stock surging on Friday. Not least, Deutsche Bank is a classic example of the species of financial animal known as Too Big To Fail.
0~Uber Fires Former Google Engineer at Heart of Self-Driving Dispute~SAN FRANCISCO — Uber said Tuesday that it had fired Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer brought in to lead the company’s self-driving automobile efforts who was accused of stealing trade secrets when he left a job at Google. What Mr. Levandowski did when he quit Google to start his own company, Otto, which was acquired by Uber for nearly $700 million last year, is the key question in a closely watched lawsuit that pits one of the world’s most powerful companies against Uber, a richly financed up-and-comer. The stakes are enormous for both businesses. Google was a pioneer in autonomous car technology and has spent nearly a decade and hundreds of millions of dollars on its effort, which is now run through Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. And Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, has said the future of his ride-hailing company, privately valued at nearly $70 billion, hinges on work being done to create cars that can drive themselves. The dismissal of one of Uber’s most prized technical talents also points to the risks of the star engineering culture that has emerged in Silicon Valley in recent years, leading to giant paydays for a small group of employees.
0~Citigroup Will Pay Travel Costs for Employee Abortions in Response to Texas Law~Citigroup says it has begun covering travel expenses for employees who seek abortions after a Texas law imposed the most restrictive limits in the nation and prompted similar proposals in other states. “In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S., beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,” the bank said in a filing on Tuesday. About 8,500 of Citigroup’s 65,000 U.S. employees are in Texas. The policy puts a Wall Street bank alongside smaller or newer companies in responding to the Texas law, which bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy and offers the prospect of $10,000 rewards for successful lawsuits against anyone who “aids or abets” a woman who gets an abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected. The law is the latest blow to the Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which prohibits states from banning the procedure before a fetus is viable outside the womb, or about 23 weeks of pregnancy. The Texas law’s novel approach has survived court challenges by putting its enforcement power in the hands of the public, rather than the government.

Even though the staff resumed knocking on doors to register students, as of July 20, only 38 kindergartners and 37 first graders had signed up, compared with 65 kindergarten students and 71 first graders in the fall of 2019. Low-income and nonwhite families have the biggest concerns about the virus and the safety of returning to classrooms, according to surveys of parents. And the rise of the Delta variant may only heighten these worries. But the pandemic has also exposed the distance between what parents want, and what schools are delivering. And at least for Ms. Ramirez, that’s the bigger consideration in keeping Bonnylin at home. “I need a miracle at this point to get out of this apartment and this neighborhood,” Ms. Ramirez said. “My kids deserve so much more.” Amelia Nierenberg contributed reporting. Jugal K. Patel contributed graphics. Data was compiled by Eric Sagara, Justine Issavi, Julia Ingram, Charlie Hoffs, Dilcia Mercedes, Justin Mayo, Elizabeth Huffaker, Christine DeLianne, Cheryl Phillips and Thomas Dee of Stanford University’s Big Local News project and Graduate School of Education; Alicia Parlapiano and Jugal K. Patel of The Times; Ryan Pitts of the journalism nonprofit OpenNews; Daniel J. Willis of EdSource; and Vignesh Ramachandran of the Colorado News Collaborative. About the data National totals were calculated by combining data from the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics with figures from the State of Illinois, which wasn’t included in the federal data. School-level data was collected directly from 33 state education departments. The Times excluded schools that were primarily virtual before the pandemic, and any that had no students in the fall of either 2019 or 2020. Neighborhood income levels came from NCES’ EDGE School Neighborhood Poverty Estimates, which uses census data to estimate the poverty level of each school’s surrounding neighborhood. Schools were considered to be in high-poverty neighborhoods when the average household income was 135 percent of the poverty level or lower, which in 2020 was $35,000 or less for a family of four. The Times also examined high-poverty schools using statistics on students receiving free and reduced price lunch, which showed similar trends. Data on which school districts operated in-person, hybrid and remote as of October was provided by Burbio.
0~Trump’s Budget Math Grapples With Economic Reality~It then predicts growth above 3 percent annually for the next several years if the administration’s economic policies are enacted. The Fed, the budget office and others all see growth falling below 2 percent annually in that time. By 2030, the administration predicts the economy will be more than 15 percent larger than forecasters at the budget office do. Inflation F.A.Q. Card 1 of 5 What is inflation? Inflation is a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys. What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production and supply chain problems. Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains can lead to higher wages and job growth. How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities like food, housing and gas. Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better. Past administrations have also dressed up their budget forecasts with economic projections that proved far too good to be true. In its fiscal year 2011 budget, for example, the Obama administration predicted several years of growth topping 4 percent in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis — a number it never came close to reaching even once. Trump officials had considered their projections to be a break from that trend, writing last year that they were the first administration on record “to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office.” That turned out to be wrong: In the middle of last year, the Commerce Department revised its accounting of the 2018 growth rate downward, to well below the rate Trump officials had forecast. Their predictions were similarly off in 2019. Robust economic growth rates are not the only area where the administration’s renewed optimism appears in its latest budget. It has also revised down its estimate of the interest the federal government would pay to borrow money over the next decade, based largely on the assumption that the Fed, which began cutting rates in 2019, would raise them only modestly again over the next 10 years. The changes in rate assumptions reduce budget deficits by $1.5 trillion over the course of the decade, according to the administration’s projections. Essentially, administration officials are contending that rising levels of debt in the United States will not drive up borrowing costs, as many conservative economists have long warned, at least for the next several years. They also believe, a rarity among economists, that a sustained stretch of 3 percent growth would not push the Fed to raise interest rates. Administration officials do not directly control Fed policy, but in a companion document to the budget, the officials wrote that federal borrowing costs would stay low “as U.S. debt continues to be in high demand because it is a safe haven for savings amidst global turmoil.”
0~Cynthia Nixon Puts Legalizing Marijuana Front and Center of Campaign~Ms. Nixon had declared her support for legalization at a small fund-raiser in Manhattan in late March — pumping her fist in enthusiasm, one attendee said — but Wednesday’s announcement was the first time she detailed her position. Regulating and taxing marijuana, she said, would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue and create jobs in the agricultural industry. In a statement to The New York Times, Ms. Nixon also suggested that she would seek to mitigate the effects of past criminalization. “Ending the injustice of putting New Yorkers in prison for marijuana is a start,” she said. “But we also have to correct past injustices, by expunging prior convictions — particularly for nonviolent offenders whose only convictions are for marijuana use.” While her candidacy has attracted attention across New York and the country — Ms. Nixon, an actress, is best known for starring in the television show “Sex and the City” — polls suggest that she faces a steep climb in her challenge to Mr. Cuomo, a second-term incumbent with $30 million in campaign funds. In a Siena College poll last month, 66 percent of Democratic voters said they would support Mr. Cuomo in a primary, compared to 19 percent who chose Ms. Nixon; among African-American voters, 77 percent backed Mr. Cuomo. Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant who is not working on either campaign, said Ms. Nixon’s selection of legalization as her first policy issue and her emphasis on racial inequities in marijuana arrests reflected her recognition of Mr. Cuomo’s bulwark of support among African-American voters. “By pushing for this, it not only helps her connect to younger minority voters but younger progressive voters. But the question is, will it be a motivator to vote?” he said. “It’s a very interesting issue choice — I’m not saying it’s crazy — but I don’t know that it will on its own do the trick.” In 2014, when Zephyr Teachout, a little-known Fordham Law professor, challenged Mr. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination, she captured one-third of ballots in the primary — but failed to win a foothold among minority voters.
0~New Netanyahu Corruption Allegations: The Details~JERUSALEM — Two more serious allegations have surfaced in the metastasizing corruption investigation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his inner circle: that one of his aides tried to bribe a judge to quash a criminal case involving Mr. Netanyahu’s wife, and that he or his aides traded lucrative regulatory approvals for favorable coverage on a news website owned by Israel’s largest telecommunications company. Mr. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing. Here is a rundown of the particulars, according to the police and Israeli news reports. Case 1270: A Big Job for a Big Favor THE BACKDROP In 2015, Mr. Netanyahu’s wife, Sara, was under investigation over allegations that she had misused government funds in managing the prime minister’s official Jerusalem residence. THE PLAYERS Nir Hefetz, a veteran journalist and political operative; Eli Kamir, an ex-journalist turned media adviser, paid $40,000 a month by the telecommunications company Bezeq; Judge Hila Gerstel, Israel’s commissioner for prosecutorial oversight.
0~How Savita Halappanavar’s Death Spurred Ireland’s Abortion Rights Campaign~For many young Irish women, hers was the first tangible story of how the Eighth Amendment, which was introduced in 1983, could affect them, said Melissa Barnes, a 20-year-old medical student. “When Savita died, that was kind of the point at which people my age, in that kind of young bracket, were made aware of what was going on,” Ms. Barnes said. “We weren’t even around when the Eighth Amendment was introduced.” Stephanie O’Toole, another 20-year-old college student from Dublin, agreed. “Her name was a catalyst for a crucial conversation,” said Ms. O’Toole. “She became a symbol of this fight for a generation of people.” Dr. Halappanavar, a dentist, and her husband, an engineer, were living in Galway in 2012 and preparing for the birth of their first child. That all changed when, 17 weeks pregnant, Dr. Halappanavar went the hospital with back pain on Oct. 21 and doctors said she was having a miscarriage. Dr. Halappanavar was told that her fetus would not survive — but that she could not be given an abortion, her husband said. Ireland, she was told, is “a Catholic country,” and it would be illegal to terminate the pregnancy while the fetus still had a heartbeat, her husband said.

0~Independence Party May Have Known of Fraud, Prosecutors Say~The Independence Party may have helped a Republican political consultant cover up a scheme to steal more than $1 million from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg during his 2009 re-election bid, the Manhattan district attorney’s office alleged in court filings released on Thursday. The documents, in which the district attorney’s office is suing the Independence Party for $1.1 million, accuse party leaders of trying to keep secret the name of the consultant, John F. Haggerty Jr., who was supposed to provide on Election Day poll-watching services for the mayor’s campaign. Prosecutors with the office of District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, say that Mr. Haggerty lied to the Bloomberg campaign to get it to pay $1.2 million to the Independence Party, and that after the party passed the money on to him, he spent most of it on himself. While prosecutors have long said that the party has been uncooperative with the investigation, this is the first time that they have said the party may have known about the alleged fraud.
0~Otto Warmbier, American Student Released From North Korea, Dies~Otto F. Warmbier, the University of Virginia honors student who was released from a North Korean prison last week after spending 17 months in captivity and more than a year in a coma, died on Monday at the Cincinnati hospital where he had been receiving treatment, his family said. Mr. Warmbier’s parents, Fred and Cindy, said in a statement that their son, 22, had “completed his journey home” and “was at peace” when he died on Monday at 2:20 p.m. “When Otto returned to Cincinnati late on June 13, he was unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands,” the couple wrote. “He looked very uncomfortable — almost anguished. Although we would never hear his voice again, within a day, the countenance of his face changed — he was at peace. He was home, and we believe he could sense that.” The death was the end of a wrenching ordeal for the Warmbier family, and is likely to worsen the already tense relations between the United States and North Korea, which technically remain in a state of war dating to the armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean War. President Trump issued a terse statement condemning North Korea, which is still holding three Americans hostage.
0~New York Is Positioned to Reopen Schools Safely, Health Experts Say~New York State, the center of the worst coronavirus outbreak in the world four months ago, is now one of the few places in the country that may be able to safely reopen schools, several public health experts said after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo gave districts permission to do so. Mr. Cuomo announced Friday that public school districts across the state could hold in-person classes this fall, even as districts in many parts of the country where cases are still rising have abandoned the idea and will continue with remote learning. In interviews, doctors, epidemiologists and other public health experts said that conditions were favorable throughout the state, including New York City, to bring children back — as long as safety precautions are in place. Some expressed concern that the effects of keeping students home were more worrisome. As of Wednesday, fewer than 1 percent of coronavirus tests statewide were positive, well below the 5 percent positivity threshold that both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have targeted as a safe standard for reopening schools.
0~Another Brilliant Year for Sebastian Vettel~Formula One seasons in which records are broken and history is written are not always the most exciting to watch. Michael Schumacher’s 2004 season, when the German won a record 13 races and racked up seven consecutive victories, is a good example. Although this season Sebastian Vettel equaled his older compatriot’s 13 victories and tied the record for a consecutive winning streak with nine triumphs, the year began on an exciting and unpredictable note that continued for more than half of the 19-race championship. It was only after the August break that it veered into the biggest walkover by a single driver in the 63-year history of the series. Even the Red Bull team’s car designer, Adrian Newey, hinted that the turnaround had to do with the Pirelli tire company’s reversion midway through the season to last year’s tire structure. “This year’s car was a very close cousin of last year’s — relatively small evolutions over the winter with essentially stable regulations,” Newey said in Texas at the penultimate race of the season, the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin. “So we really started this year where we left off last year from a car point of view and it was just about developing it, understanding it. I think the change in tires back to the 2012 tires was also obviously something that had an effect on the car and possibly suited us — it’s difficult to know exactly.”
0~What Is Obstruction of Justice? An Often Murky Crime, Explained~“He really needs a lawyer,” Ms. O’Sullivan said of Mr. Trump. “He is building a beautiful case against himself.” Did Trump have lawful authority to fire Comey? Yes. But courts have ruled that otherwise lawful acts can constitute obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions. In a 1998 case, for example, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of a lawyer who had filed legal complaints and related motions against a government agent who was investigating an illegal gambling operation. The court ruled that the defendant’s “nominally litigation-related conduct” was unlawful because his real motive was “to safeguard his personal financial interests” in the corrupt enterprise. What would such a case entail, in theory? Obstruction of justice cases often come down to whether prosecutors can prove defendants’ mental state when they committed the act, legal specialists said. It is not enough to show that a defendant knew the act would have a side consequence of impeding an investigation; achieving that obstruction has to have been the specific intention. Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor who led the Justice Department’s Enron task force and now teaches criminal law at Duke University, was initially skeptical about whether the mere firing of Mr. Comey could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Trump had an improper mental state. But he said on Tuesday that subsequent revelations have made the evidence much more robust. “The evidence of improper purpose has gotten much stronger since the day of Comey’s firing,” Mr. Buell said. “Trump has made admissions about that. And we now have evidence that he may have indicated an improper purpose previously in his communications with Comey about the Russia investigation.” What impediments would there be to charging Mr. Trump? Ms. O’Sullivan said it was not realistic to expect the Trump administration’s Justice Department to charge the sitting president. And Mr. Buell argued that the developments had strengthened the case for Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who is overseeing the investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, to appoint a special counsel to handle it. “The issue right now is whether there needs to be a serious impartial investigation, and there can be no doubt about that at this point,” said Mr. Buell, who said the developments showed that Mr. Comey needed to be interviewed as a witness. “This kind of drip, drip, drip — we keep addressing this scenario as ‘here is the evidence, what is the result,’ but that’s only good until tomorrow when something else comes out. It is not at all clear that this is the end. If anything, it has become clearer that there is more to know.”

0~Americans Are Flush With Cash and Jobs. They Also Think the Economy Is Awful.~Americans are, by many measures, in a better financial position than they have been in many years. They also believe the economy is in terrible shape. This is the great contradiction that underlies President Biden’s poor approval ratings, recent Republican victories in state elections and the touch-and-go negotiations over the Biden legislative agenda. It presents a fundamental challenge for economic policy, which has succeeded at lifting the wealth, incomes and job prospects of millions of people — but has not made Americans, in their own self-perception, any better off. Workers have seized the upper hand in the labor market, attaining the largest raises in decades and quitting their jobs at record rates. The unemployment rate is 4.6 percent and has been falling rapidly. Cumulatively, Americans are sitting on piles of cash; they have accumulated $2.3 trillion more in savings in the last 19 months than would have been expected in the prepandemic path. The median household’s checking account balance was 50 percent higher in July of this year than in 2019, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute. Yet workers’ assessment of the economy is scathing. In a Gallup poll in October, 68 percent of respondents said they thought economic conditions were getting worse. The share who thought things were getting better was lower than in April 2009, when the global financial crisis was still underway. And it is not merely a partisan response to the Biden presidency. In the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey, Republicans rate current economic conditions worse than Democrats do — but both groups give ratings about as low as they did in the early 2010s, when unemployment was much higher and Americans’ finances were a wreck.
0~Why Only 28 Percent of Young Black New Yorkers Are Vaccinated~In interviews, Black men and women said that much of their distrust of the coronavirus vaccine was shaped by their own experiences with discrimination or their identity as Black Americans. “I’m supposed to worry about getting sick when I go outside, versus getting killed by a cop or something like that?” said Jayson Clemons, 41, the construction site safety manager from Queens. After years of trying to be careful not to give the police a reason to stop him — avoiding cars with window tint or rims, and making sure when commuting that his attire clearly marked him as a construction worker — he said he refused to be preoccupied by Covid-19. He said he would rather put his trust in masks and hand sanitizer — which he credits with keeping him healthy as he worked at construction sites throughout the pandemic — than a new vaccine that the government is pushing people to take. “They came out with one so fast for Covid, and now they want to pay you to take it,” he said. “It seems fishy.” Some Black women described the need they felt to conduct their own research — and ask around — before deciding if the coronavirus vaccine was safe. “It takes a little bit of hyper-vigilance when you’re a woman of color,” said Jazmine Shavuo-Goodwin, 31, who believes she encountered medical racism when doctors were dismissive of her severe stomach problems. “There’s a lot of homework you have to do, because your doctors may not truly listen to you, to your full complaint, before they’ve already diagnosed you.” Ms. Shavuo-Goodwin helps manage dental clinics for Medicaid patients and is studying to be a clinical therapist. Both her job and school require her to be vaccinated against coronavirus, but she has yet to get a shot. “I’m out of compliance,” said Ms. Shavuo-Goodwin, who is Black and lives in the South Bronx. “I have done heaps of research looking for things that would make me confident and comfortable getting the vaccine, but honestly I haven’t.”
0~As Putin Orders Drills in Crimea, Protesters’ Clash Shows Region’s Divide~SIMFEROPOL, Ukraine — With cries of “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” thousands of protesters in the capital of Ukraine’s Crimea region, a tinderbox of ethnic, religious and political divisions, added an Islamic voice on Wednesday to the tumultuous struggle for Ukraine that last weekend drove the president from power and that has pushed Russia and the West into a face-off reminiscent of the Cold War. Eight hundred miles away, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was ordering a surprise military exercise of ground and air forces on Ukraine’s doorstep on Wednesday, adding to the tensions with Europe and the United States and underscoring his intention to keep the country in Moscow’s orbit. Taken together, the two events illustrated the continuing challenges that the new government in Kiev faces in calming separatism at home and placating a frustrated Russian leader who sees Ukraine as a vital part of his strategy of rebuilding Russian influence along the lines not of the former Soviet Union but of the czars. While few analysts expected a Russian military intervention in Ukraine, most said Mr. Putin was likely to respond in some fashion to such a stinging geopolitical defeat. The question was how, and on Wednesday he provided a first answer, when Russia’s military put tens of thousands of troops in western Russia on alert at 2 p.m. for an exercise scheduled to last until March 3. The minister of defense, Sergei K. Shoigu, also announced unspecified measures to tighten security at the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet on the Crimean Peninsula.
0~Former Acting Governor of New Jersey Is Accused of Harassing a Colleague~TRENTON, Oct. 24 — Donald T. DiFrancesco, a former acting governor of New Jersey who was also president of the State Senate for nearly a decade, has been accused of sexual harassment by a former partner at his law firm, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday. The suit, filed by Michele D’Onofrio, 48, a former partner in the law firm DiFrancesco, Bateman, Coley, Yospin, Kunzman, Davis & Lehrer, contends that she “was regularly subjected to unwelcome and sexist comments and advances” by Mr. DiFrancesco. The suit also contends that she was wrongfully dismissed. In particular, the suit says that in November 2002, at a convention in Atlantic City, Mr. DiFrancesco asked Ms. D’Onofrio “to stay an extra night in his suite and to attend a Beach Boys concert with him.” She said she refused. According to the suit, Mr. DiFrancesco, 62, also made what Ms. D’Onofrio said were lewd comments in connection with her plans to have reconstructive surgery after breast cancer. And the lawsuit claims that other female employees have complained of “unwelcome comments and touching” by Mr. DiFrancesco.
0~Passover Under Coronavirus Lockdown: Israeli Jews Revise the Rituals~Mr. Bennett also proposed that all those celebrating step out onto their balconies or into their yards at 8:30 p.m. precisely and sing “The Four Questions,” a popular part of the liturgy, as one people, out loud. The first line of the song — “Why is this night different from all other nights?” — is likely to resonate and set off many a debate around the table this year. For those less concerned with the strictures of Jewish law on technology, an Israeli television channel will broadcast a live, star-studded “Great Israeli Seder” featuring popular celebrities, journalists and politicians. The religious questions arising from Zooming this year’s Seder gatherings set off a fiery, Talmudic-like debate among Israel’s rabbis, who had to weigh whether the psychological distress caused by family separation and loneliness justified the use of screens and devices based on the principle of allowing exceptions to religious law to save a life. A group of venerable rabbis of Moroccan descent presented a nuanced ruling in favor of allowing video chat for this year only, provided that the session starts before the official onset of the holiday at sunset, with no further clicking after that. Some of the younger generation would be unlikely to participate in a Seder without their grandparents, they argued, and for the elderly and those living alone, a Zoomed Seder could alleviate sadness and depression and augment the will to live.
0~Why New York Lawmakers Are Holding a Special Session on Evictions~One is to vote to extend the moratorium, possibly until mid-January. The second is to modify the moratorium so it complies with a Supreme Court ruling that recently blocked one of its key measures. Democrats, who are in the majority, believe they have the votes, as well as the support of Gov. Kathy C. Hochul, to do both. What is the Legislature hoping to provide for renters? Time. The moratorium on evictions is a short-term solution, a stopgap precipitated by the pandemic after so many tenants lost their jobs and were unable to pay rent. The $2.7 billion in rent relief is supposed to help low-income renters pay overdue rent. By paying the rent, they can stay in their homes. But the state has been incredibly slow at disbursing the money, with only about $200 million released so far. The application process has been confusing for landlords and tenants — if they know about the program at all. How are landlords likely to respond? They have been focused on how lawmakers will craft legislation so it conforms with the Supreme Court ruling, which had sided with landlords. Under the moratorium, tenants could obtain protection from eviction if they filed a form saying they had suffered financial hardship, such as loss of income. Landlords said they had no way of challenging those forms, arguing that some tenants could be using them to stay in their homes without paying rent even though they had the ability to do so. On Wednesday, lawmakers are expected to modify the moratorium so landlords can challenge the claims in court. Even so, we could see lawsuits from landlord groups. What’s the status of the rent relief program? Can that help renters avoid eviction right now? Yes. Tenants who qualify can apply to a state program that is disbursing $2.7 billion in aid to help cover, among other things, up to 12 months of unpaid rent.
0~Quiet Support for Saudis Entangles U.S. in Yemen~WASHINGTON — Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia’s urbane, well-connected ambassador to Washington, arrived at the White House last March with the urgent hope of getting President Obama’s support for a new war in the Middle East. Iran had moved into Saudi Arabia’s backyard, Mr. Jubeir told Mr. Obama’s senior advisers, and was aiding rebels in Yemen who had overrun the country’s capital and were trying to set up ballistic missile sites in range of Saudi cities. Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf neighbors were poised to begin a campaign in support of Yemen’s impotent government — an offensive Mr. Jubeir said could be relatively swift. Two days of discussions in the West Wing followed, but there was little real debate. Among other reasons, the White House needed to placate the Saudis as the administration completed a nuclear deal with Iran, Saudi Arabia’s archenemy. That fact alone eclipsed concerns among many of the president’s advisers that the Saudi-led offensive would be long, bloody and indecisive. Mr. Obama soon gave his approval for the Pentagon to support the impending military campaign. A year later, the war has been a humanitarian disaster for Yemen and a study in the perils of the Obama administration’s push to get Middle Eastern countries to take on bigger military roles in their neighborhood. Thousands of Yemeni civilians have been killed, many by Saudi jets flying too high to accurately deliver the bombs to their targets. Peace talks have been stalled for months. American spy agencies have concluded that Yemen’s branch of Al Qaeda has only grown more powerful in the chaos.
0~New York City’s Vaccine Passport Plan Renews Online Privacy Debate~When New York City announced on Tuesday that it would soon require people to show proof of at least one coronavirus vaccine shot to enter businesses, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the system was “simple — just show it and you’re in.” Less simple was the privacy debate that the city reignited. Vaccine passports, which show proof of vaccination, often in electronic form such as an app, are the bedrock of Mr. de Blasio’s plan. For months, these records — also known as health passes or digital health certificates — have been under discussion around the world as a tool to allow vaccinated people, who are less at risk from the virus, to gather safely. New York will be the first U.S. city to include these passes in a vaccine mandate, potentially setting off similar actions elsewhere. But the mainstreaming of these credentials could also usher in an era of increased digital surveillance, privacy researchers said. That’s because vaccine passes may enable location tracking, even as there are few rules about how people’s digital vaccine data should be stored and how it can be shared. While existing privacy laws limit the sharing of information among medical providers, there is no such rule for when people upload their own data onto an app.
0~The Erdogan Experiment~To understand Erdogan's dilemma, it helps to understand the depths of Turkey's commitment to secularism. It began with the very establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, and the founding father Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's rejection of traditional Islam as incompatible with his goal of establishing a modern European state. Ataturk shut the Islamic caliphate, dissolved religious courts, outlawed mystic sects and secularized schools. He replaced the Arabic script with Latin script. He outlawed the fez and all but imposed the homburg. He adopted the Swiss civil code and granted women the vote. As secular nationalism became Turkey's religion, the military took on the role of protecting Ataturk's legacy, which meant keeping elected officials on a leash and overthrowing or undermining them if necessary. Erdogan himself is unofficially on probation. Turkey's ''deep state'' sees its duty as preventing the nation from backsliding into religion and ethnic, especially Kurdish, separatism. Islam was, of course, never snuffed out. While most Turks came to consider themselves Turks first, they were still Muslims. And from the start, especially in the heartland, traditional Islam survived despite repression. To this day, in what seems an arcane, self-defeating expression of Turkey's secularism, women wearing head scarves are not allowed to attend universities or work in government. Prime Minister Erdogan's two daughters, in fact, go to Indiana University, where they are free to cover their hair and get a degree at the same time. His wife does not appear at state functions lest her designer head scarf provoke fears of an imminent theocracy. Erdogan's family comes from a devout world in the Black Sea region. His father, Ahmet, migrated to Istanbul in the 1930's, settled in Kasimpasa, a rough working-class quarter, and found work as a captain with a state maritime company. Kasimpasa has a body language all its own, and Turks say that Erdogan retains the Kasimpasa swagger, a way of leading with his right shoulder. Although the district was infamous for its gangs and pickpockets, Erdogan remembers the neighborhood as an idyll, with fruit trees and fields, where kids could get their hands dirty. ''I was shaped by that mud,'' he said, ''not like the poor kids of today who are surrounded by asphalt.'' Near the now-ramshackle mosque where Erdogan studied the Koran as a child, the district manager of Kasimpasa, Ali Riza Sivritepe, spoke of growing up with him. They fetched water from the same well, flew kites and shot marbles over the irregular paving stones. (Erdogan, steely in his ambition even then, always won.) ''He was a very serious child,'' Sivritepe said. ''Everyone respected him here and called him Big Brother.'' His father, according to a biography, was an authoritarian with a temper that could be tamed best by Erdogan's kissing his shoes. Once, Erdogan's father punished him for using bad language by hanging him from the ceiling by the arms. ''After that day, I never swore again,'' Erdogan said. When Erdogan was 7, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes -- ''God bless his soul,'' Erdogan said -- was hanged. Elected in 1950 in Turkey's first free elections, Menderes was a secularist but demonstrated a tolerance for religious practice that his predecessors had not possessed. Over 10 years in government, he faltered and became repressive, and when the Turkish military overthrew him, the coup was largely welcomed. But when Menderes was sent to the gallows, many Turks were horrified. ''Some are saddened by things like this, and they give up,'' Erdogan said. ''In my case, this sadness turned into an attraction for politics.'' Part of the Erdogan lore is that in fifth grade he refused to use a newspaper as a prayer rug in a religion class. It was inappropriate, he told his teacher, who took a special interest in him and persuaded Erdogan's father to send him to a state-run Prayer Leaders and Preachers school, which offered a secular curriculum amplified by religious instruction. Erdogan was particularly good at reciting nationalist poetry. During poetry contests, Sivritepe recalled, Erdogan would hide a Turkish flag inside his shirt and whip it out for dramatic effect.
0~Clinton Issues Pardons, Clearing Deutch and McDougal, but Not Milken or Hubbell~WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 — With just hours to go in his presidency today, Bill Clinton issued pardons to 140 people, including John Deutch, a former director of central intelligence; Henry G. Cisneros, a former secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and Susan H. McDougal, a onetime Clinton business partner who was jailed in the Whitewater scandal. Others receiving presidential pardons in one of Mr. Clinton's last official acts were his half-brother, Roger, who pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine in Arkansas, and Patricia Hearst Shaw, the heiress who robbed a bank in 1974 after being kidnapped by a small band of political radicals that called itself the Symbionese Liberation Army. Aides to the president said those on the list fit no pattern. Some, in Mr. Clinton's view, had been victims of overzealous prosecutors. Others had made a convincing case in their written petitions that they had already paid their debt to society. The offenses of those on the list varied widely. There were white-collar criminals and drug offenders, killers and an accused spy. Arnold Paul Prosperi, a fund-raiser for the former president, had been convicted of embezzling money from a law client. David Ronald Chandler, who long insisted he was innocent, was the first person sentenced to death under the federal drug kingpin law. Both had their sentences commuted. Norman Lyle Prouse, who received a pardon, was among the first commercial pilots to be convicted of flying while intoxicated. Witnesses testified that Mr. Prouse had consumed 15 to 20 rum-and-colas at the Speak Easy bar in Moorhead, Minn., the night before a 6:30 a.m. flight.
0~Iran-Led Push to Retake Falluja From ISIS Worries U.S.~BAGHDAD — American commandos are on the front lines in Syria in a new push toward the Islamic State’s de facto capital in Raqqa, but in Iraq it is an entirely different story: Iran, not the United States, has become the face of an operation to retake the jihadist stronghold of Falluja from the militant group. On the outskirts of Falluja, tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, police officers and Shiite militiamen backed by Iran are preparing for an assault on the Sunni city, raising fears of a sectarian blood bath. Iran has placed advisers, including its top spymaster, Qassim Suleimani, on the ground to assist in the operation. The battle over Falluja has evolved into yet another example of how United States and Iranian interests seemingly converge and clash at the same time in Iraq. Both want to defeat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But the United States has long believed that Iran’s role, which relies on militias accused of sectarian abuses, can make matters worse by angering Sunnis and making them more sympathetic to the militants. While the battle against the Islamic State straddles the borders of Iraq and Syria, the United States has approached it as two separate fights. In Syria, where the government of Bashar al-Assad is an enemy, America’s ally is the Kurds.
0~Tree of Life Synagogue Plans a New Beginning, Years After Deadly Shooting~“That struck in my heart,” he said. In Pittsburgh, the months that followed the attack were filled with grief, condolence and recitations of the mourner’s Kaddish. The wounded began to recover and some worshipers poured their anguish into activism. The gears of the judicial process began to turn, if slowly; the man charged with attacking the synagogue has yet to go to trial. But in those first few weeks were also the beginnings of a delicate conversation about the building itself. In December 2018, a Pittsburgh urban design firm, Rothschild Doyno Collaborative, began holding a series of listening sessions with members of the three congregations at the synagogue, which had been gathering for worship in the smaller chapels of other synagogues in Pittsburgh. Opinions about the future of the Tree of Life building ranged widely, from demolishing it to rebuilding it exactly as it had been to creating something new. Two of the congregations, Dor Hadash and New Light, decided not to return. But, Rabbi Myers said, a consensus began to form among members of Tree of Life that they wanted to come back. “As time went on, it became clearer through all of these conversations,” he said, “that the predominance was: We must return. If we don’t, we give the message that evil won, because it chased us out of our building.”
0~Columnist Critical of Beijing Quits Hong Kong Newspaper~Willy Wo-Lap Lam works in a newsroom in Hong Kong, but his column delves into the inner sanctum of the Chinese Communist Party. That combination, ticklish in the best of times, proved combustible today as Mr. Lam and his newspaper parted company. Mr. Lam resigned as a columnist and editor at The South China Morning Post because, he said, the paper's Hong Kong owner would no longer tolerate his reporting of behind-the-scenes politics in Beijing. Last Thursday, Mr. Lam was stripped of his duties as China editor, though he was told he could keep writing the column. That came less than five months after Mr. Lam was publicly chided for one of his columns by The Post's owner, Robert Kuok, in a scorching letter to the editor. ''For me, it was like the emperor had spoken,'' Mr. Lam, 48, said in an interview. ''The writing was on the wall.''
0~In Choice of Fed Chairman, Trump Downgrades Deregulation~Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress argue that excessive financial regulation, much of it created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, is inhibiting economic growth. The Trump administration in June released a plan for reducing regulation, much of which can be carried out by the Fed and other regulators without legislation. The changes would exempt smaller banks from many postcrisis regulations, and loosen restrictions on larger banks. That would let banks borrow more freely, and take more risks with that money. At a hearing a few weeks after the plan was released, Mr. Powell offered a tepid review. “I see it is a mixed bag,” he said. “There are some ideas in the report that make sense, maybe not as expressed there, but it would enable us to reduce the cost of regulation without affecting safety and soundness.” But, he added, “There are some ideas that I would not support.” Since joining the Fed in May 2012, Mr. Powell has voted in favor of every action to tighten regulation the Fed has undertaken. But he has sometimes expressed concerns in internal discussions about the effects of those decisions, and about the aggregate weight of so many new regulations. At the June hearing, he said that there were clear opportunities for improvement. “The whole idea is to preserve the significant core reforms that were made but to go back and clean up our work,” he said. Specifically, Mr. Powell wants to overhaul the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent big banks from making certain kinds of risky investments with their own money. Mr. Powell and other Fed officials have long regarded the rule as costly and ineffective, in part because they say it duplicates other measures aimed at limiting risk-taking.

0~As Virus Spreads, Anger Floods Chinese Social Media~In recent days, though, Beijing seems to be reasserting its primacy over information in ways that go beyond mere rumor control. At a meeting this past weekend between Mr. Xi and other senior leaders, one of the measures they resolved to take against the virus was to “strengthen the guidance of public opinion.” Wang Huning, the head of the Communist Party’s publicity department and an influential party ideologue, was also recently named deputy head of the team in charge of containing the outbreak, behind only China’s premier, Li Keqiang. Chinese officials seem to recognize that social media can be a useful tool for feeling out public opinion in times of crisis. WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging platform, said over the weekend that it would crack down hard on rumors about the virus. But it also created a tool for users to report tips and information about the disease and the response. Internet backlash may already have caused one local government in China to change course on its virus-fighting policies. The southern city of Shantou announced on Sunday that it was stopping cars, ships and people from entering the city, in a policy that echoed ones in Wuhan. But then word went around that the decision had led people to panic-buy food, and by the afternoon, the order had been rescinded.
0~Covid Experts Fear the Worst With Trump in Charge and Winter Coming~WASHINGTON — Regardless of the election’s outcome this week, President Trump will be the one steering the country through what is likely to be the darkest and potentially deadliest period of the coronavirus pandemic, and he has largely excluded the nation’s leading health experts from his inner circle. Mr. Trump will still have control of the nation’s health apparatus and the bully pulpit that comes with the Oval Office until Jan. 20, as infections approach 100,000 a day and death rates begin to rise as hospitals are strained to their breaking points. But the president has largely shuttered the White House Coronavirus Task Force and doubled down on anti-science language, telling voters that the country is “rounding the corner” in the fight against the virus that has claimed nearly a quarter of a million lives. He has stopped listening to Alex M. Azar II, his health secretary; Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration; and Dr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general. On Monday, the president lashed out at Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s leading infectious disease specialist, hinting that he may fire Dr. Fauci after the election — though it would be extremely difficult for him to do so.
0~China’s New Lenders Collect Invasive Data and Offer Billions. Beijing Is Worried.~Last month, Guangdong Province in southern China warned that more than a dozen apps had security loopholes that allowed companies to steal user information. Some of this information was then used to harass borrowers and their friends and families. One of those was an app called Paipaidai. Its parent company, PPDAI Group, recently listed its shares in New York. The Guangdong authorities said the app sends out users’ contacts without permission. The practice “seriously exposed users’ privacy,” the authorities said. One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian Province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Mr. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them. Mr. Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to “use whatever method to deal” with debt that he owed to Paipaidai. When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai. Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment. Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China’s most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree. One of those was a company named Smart Finance. Its app — Yongqianbao, or “use wallet” in Chinese — helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent start-up investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.
0~Protesters Force Israel to Grapple With Wealth Gap~But the issue has had strong populist resonance. Although Israel’s economy is strong, the data on wealth concentration, published by the Bank of Israel, are unsettling. A small group of family-owned companies control banks, supermarket chains and media, cellphone and insurance companies. They borrow heavily, posing risks for the larger economy and, through a web of interconnecting enterprises, make it harder for others to get into the markets they dominate. “These are called pyramid schemes because through shares in one company they take control of a second company and, through that, of another one on down a chain of holdings,” said Eytan Sheshinski, an economist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “They are able to move profits through the pyramid, which cannot happen in the United States because of the tax system there.” Still, the Bank of Israel study shows that while the United States, Britain and Germany have much less concentration of wealth than Israel, it is not so different from several other democracies. Based on the holdings of the 10 largest business families, Israel is in about the same situation as Switzerland, France and Belgium, and its wealth is far less concentrated than is the case in Sweden. Last fall, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formed a committee to examine the concentration of wealth and find ways to reduce the power of monopolies. “A pyramid is a tool to leverage heavily your capital, and retain control over large economic entities,” said Prof. Eugene Kandel, Mr. Netanyahu’s chief economic adviser, in an interview. “We know from looking at other countries that large and leveraged business groups can slow growth, cause instability and hinder competition. The committee appointed by Prime Minister Netanyahu works to prevent this from growing into a large-scale program in Israel.” Daniel Doron, who directs the Israel Center for Social and Economic Progress, a pro-market research organization, said he was convinced that the way in which failing state assets were privatized in the 1980s and ’90s led to dangerous consolidation, just as it did in the former Soviet Union and some Arab countries, like Egypt and Syria. Banks, construction and mining companies, all owned by agencies of the state and all in varying degrees of trouble, were sold to those who could afford to buy them.
0~Europe’s Carbon Market Is Sputtering as Prices Dive~LONDON — On a showery afternoon last week in West London, a ripple of enthusiasm went through the trading floor of CF Partners, a privately owned financial company. The price of carbon allowances, shown in green lights on a board hanging from the ceiling, was creeping up toward three euros. That is pretty small change — $3.90, or only about 10 percent of what the price was in 2008. But to the traders it came as a relief after the market had gone into free fall to record lows two days earlier, after the European Parliament spurned an effort to shore up prices by shrinking the number of allowances. “The market still stands,” said Thomas Rassmuson, a native of Sweden who founded the company with Jonathan Navon, a Briton, in 2006. Still, Europe’s carbon market, a pioneering effort to use markets to regulate greenhouse gases, is having a hard time staying upright. This year has been stomach-churning for the people who make their living in the arcane world of trading emissions permits. The most recent volatility comes on top of years of uncertainty during which prices have fluctuated from $40 to nearly zero for the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide.
0~Husband of Kellyanne Conway Steps Back From Possible Justice Dept. Post~WASHINGTON — George T. Conway III, the husband of the presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, has withdrawn himself from consideration to become the head of the Justice Department’s civil division, he said in a statement on Friday, citing family considerations as he became the latest sign of personnel woes at the White House. Mr. Conway had been President Trump’s pick to lead an office staffed by about 1,000 lawyers — with a vast portfolio of cases dealing with issues ranging from national security to the actions of the president — but his nomination had not yet been submitted to the Senate. Mr. Conway’s decision to step aside comes as the White House — hobbled from the start by a sluggish transition that failed to generate a list of fully vetted candidates — is still struggling to fill some of the most important positions in the federal government. James Donovan, whom Mr. Trump nominated last month to be the deputy secretary of the Treasury, dropped out just three days later, citing family considerations. Also last month, Mark E. Green, a Tennessee state senator and Army flight surgeon, became the second person to withdraw as Mr. Trump’s prospective secretary of the Army. The president has also yet to settle on a new F.B.I. director after his abrupt firing last month of James B. Comey. Former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut announced he did not want to be considered for that position, citing his law firm’s role in the legal team being assembled to represent Mr. Trump during investigations into whether his presidential campaign had ties to Russia.
0~China’s Economy Grows Strongly, Yet Central Bank Eases Policy~BEIJING — China’s economy firmly hit its growth target last year and even accelerated a bit at the end. In most countries, that would be seen as unequivocally good news. But this is China, where figures are sometimes doubted and where economists look for signs of strain underneath the numbers. Indeed, Chinese officials who released the economic data on Friday faced questions about the country’s mounting debt. And in an unusual move, its central bank on Friday took an extra step to inject more money into the economy over the next month. China’s economy grew 6.7 percent last year after accelerating slightly to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the government’s statistics bureau announced on Friday morning. The strong economic growth in 2016 came after a weak start last year, when China’s currency and stock market were tumbling and many foreign investors fretted that the country’s three decades of robust economic expansion might be ending.
0~Airstrike at Yemen Cement Factory Said to Kill at Least 15~SANA, Yemen — An airstrike by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia hit a cement factory north of Sana, Yemen’s capital, on Wednesday evening, killing at least 15 people, including civilian workers in nearby businesses, according to local security and medical officials. The bombing of the factory, in Amran Province, came days after Saudi officials pledged to form a high-level committee to investigate strikes in Yemen’s civil war that have killed civilians, and to improve their military’s aerial targeting with advice from American and British experts. The coalition has been fighting since March on behalf of Yemen’s exiled government to defeat a rebel movement from the north known as the Houthis. The coalition bombing campaign has intensified throughout northern Yemen over the last two months, since the breakdown of negotiations to end the civil war, and as anti-Houthi forces have mounted an offensive aimed at capturing Sana from the rebels.

0~‘Downloadable Gun’ Clears a Legal Obstacle, and Activists Are Alarmed~"But as the “landmark settlement” brings ghost gun instructions out into the open, it could also give felons and domestic abusers access to firearms that background checks would otherwise block them from owning, said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The current laws are already difficult to enforce — they’re historically not especially powerful, and they’re riddled with loopholes — and this will just make those laws easier to evade,” Mr. Winkler said. ""It not only allows this tech to flourish out of the underground but gives it legal sanction.” Some saw the settlement as proof that the Trump administration wanted to further deregulate the gun industry and increase access to firearms. This year, the administration proposed a rule change that would revise and streamline the process for exporting consumer firearms and related technical information, including tutorials for 3-D printed designs. The change, long sought by firearms manufacturers, would shift jurisdiction of certain items from the State Department to the Commerce Department, which uses a simpler licensing procedure for exports. On Thursday and Friday, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence filed requests under the Freedom of Information Act for any documents showing how the government decided on the settlement over printable firearms, and whether organizations like the National Rifle Association or the National Shooting Sports Foundation were involved. Neither trade group commented for this article, but some gun advocates said Mr. Trump has been less helpful toward the firearms industry than he had suggested he would be. Mr. Wilson also said that “there has not been a pro-gun streak” under Mr. Trump’s Justice Department, though he praised the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, who is seen as a champion of Second Amendment rights, to the Supreme Court."
0~California Senate Passes Bill Reining In Amazon Labor Model~In the latest sign of the growing scrutiny of Amazon’s labor practices, the California State Senate on Wednesday approved a bill that would place limits on production quotas for warehouse workers. The bill, which passed the Senate 26-to-11, was written partly in response to high rates of injuries at Amazon warehouses. The legislation prohibits companies from imposing production quotas that prevent workers from taking state-mandated breaks or using the bathroom when needed, or that keep employers from complying with health and safety laws. The Assembly, which passed an initial version in May, is expected to approve the Senate measure by the end of the state’s legislative session on Friday. “In the Amazon warehouse space, what we’re trying to take on is this increased use of quotas and discipline based on not meeting the quotas, without a human factor in dealing with a reason why a worker might not make a quota,” Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the bill’s author, said in an interview last week.
0~Fox’s Unfamiliar but Powerful Television Rival: Sinclair~Sinclair is eager to broaden its reach. Last month, the company hired Boris Epshteyn, a former spokesman for President Trump, as its chief political analyst and on-air commentator. And the company has been emboldened by the Trump administration’s easing of rules that had stymied its expansion. “Sinclair was growing and building before there was this Fox controversy,” said Armstrong Williams, owner of Howard Stirk Holdings, the largest African-American-owned station group, which has two affiliates that have joint-operating agreements with Sinclair. “It was leveraging itself and looking for acquisitions.” Representatives for Sinclair and Fox declined to comment for this article. Founded in 1971 by Julian Sinclair Smith, an electrical engineer who understood the growing importance of broadcast television, Sinclair has expanded from one station serving Baltimore to 173 stations and 81 markets across the country. Much of that growth has come under the helm of Mr. Smith’s son David, Sinclair’s longtime chairman. Under the younger Mr. Smith, one of four brothers who together control the broadcaster’s voting stock, Sinclair has spent more than $7 billion since the mid-1990s on acquisitions, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence. “We’re forever expanding — like the universe,” Mr. Smith told The Baltimore Sun in 1995. It also operates stations owned by affiliates, some of which are majority owned by the Smith family, pushing up against Federal Communications Commission boundaries on station ownership in individual markets. In 2009, burdened by nearly $1.3 billion of debt and the recession, Sinclair warned that it might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. But today the company has a market value of nearly $3.4 billion and has expanded into original content and sports, even acquiring the Tennis Channel. Along the way, Mr. Smith and his brothers have become active in politics. Some of their giving has been to Democrats, mostly for state and local races in Maryland. But a vast majority of their money has been funneled to Republican causes, including the Republican National Committee and a Mitt Romney fund-raising committee in 2012, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures.
0~Covid Creates Higher Risk for Blood Clots Than Vaccines Do~The largest published study to date of certain post-vaccine side effects found that people were at slightly higher than normal risk of blood clots after receiving an AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech shot. But the same clotting conditions were substantially more likely to occur — and over longer periods — among people infected with the coronavirus, the study found. Coupled with another study this week from Israel, the data, published on Thursday night in The British Medical Journal, added to the growing evidence that though the coronavirus vaccines are associated with certain rare side effects, those risks are dwarfed by the risks from Covid-19. The study was based on the electronic health records of more than 29 million people in England. It went beyond previous analyses in finding a link not only between very rare clotting conditions and the AstraZeneca vaccine, but also between those conditions and the Pfizer vaccine. Earlier studies had detected increased clotting risks after the AstraZeneca vaccine, but not after the Pfizer shot. In interviews, the new paper’s co-authors said that the numbers of those cases they detected — involving clots blocking a vein that drains blood from the brain — were small enough that further studies were needed. Even the increased risk of those clots was far outweighed by people’s chances of developing them after contracting the virus itself, the study said.

Warns~WASHINGTON — The new head of the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that America’s trade war with China could cost the global economy around $700 billion by 2020 — a loss equivalent to the size of Switzerland’s entire economy. In her first speech as managing director, Kristalina Georgieva said the global economy had shifted from a synchronized upswing two years ago to a synchronized slowdown, weighed down in part by the pain of President Trump’s trade war. The fund will be downgrading its projections for global growth in 2019 and 2020 next week, when it releases new projections of the economic losses related to the trade war between the United States and China. “We have spoken in the past about the dangers of trade disputes,” Ms. Georgieva said. “Now, we see that they are actually taking a toll.” The warning comes at a potential turning point in the trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. American and Chinese negotiators are meeting in Washington this week to try to resolve a trade war that has begun to inflict economic pain in both countries. Negotiators are hoping to reach an agreement that would improve some of the Chinese economic practices the Trump administration has complained about and potentially roll back some of the tariffs Mr. Trump has placed on more than $360 billion of Chinese goods.
0~Google TV Faces Delays Amid Poor Reviews~Google TV has just enacted its first programming cancellation. The Consumer Electronics Show next month in Las Vegas was meant to be the great coming-out party for Google’s new software for televisions, which adds Web video and other computer smarts to TV sets. Although Google already has a deal with Sony for its Internet TVs, other television makers  Toshiba, LG Electronics and Sharp  were prepared to flaunt their versions of the systems. But Google has asked the TV makers to delay their introductions, according to people familiar with the company’s plans, so that it can refine the software, which has received a lukewarm reception. The late request caught some of the manufacturers off guard. And it illustrates the struggles Google faces as it tries to expand into the tricky, unfamiliar realm of consumer electronics, and drum up broad interest in a Web-based TV product that consumers want. Google has a long history of putting out new products and then revising them on the fly. But in the consumer electronics market, companies place big, well-timed bets  to attract holiday buyers, say, or back-to-school shoppers. This year, for example, computer makers waited for Google’s new ChromeOS software so they could ship new types of Web-based laptops. But delays at Google led the manufacturers to miss this year’s holiday season.
0~China Sentences Taiwanese Human Rights Activist in Subversion Case~TAIPEI, Taiwan — A Chinese court sentenced a human rights activist from Taiwan to five years in prison Tuesday for state subversion, the first time China has convicted a Taiwanese citizen of that crime. A video released by the Yueyang People’s Intermediate Court in southern China’s Hunan Province showed the activist, Lee Ming-cheh, sitting silently as a judicial officer read a statement accusing him of conspiring with a Chinese partner to foment a “Western color revolution” in China by disseminating articles, books and videos attacking China’s political system. For many here, the verdict is viewed as the latest shot fired in China’s psychological war on Taiwan, one that has been heating up for more than a year since Beijing cut off official communication channels with Taipei. Beijing has turned a cold shoulder to the administration of Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, blaming her refusal to accede to demands that she accept Taiwan as part of “one China.” China seeks to annex Taiwan, by force if necessary, though polls in Taiwan show scant desire to unify.
0~U.S. Weighs Inquiry Into Big Banks’ Storage of Commodities~A tactic devised by Goldman Sachs and other financial players that has inflated the price of aluminum — and ultimately cost consumers billions of dollars — is coming under federal scrutiny. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has taken the first step in an examination of warehouse operations that are controlled by Goldman Sachs, Glencore Xstrata, the Noble Group and others and used to store vast amounts of aluminum. The operations were the subject of an article by The New York Times that was published on Sunday. The commission has told the firms to retain internal documents and e-mails related to the businesses, according to people who reviewed the requests and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the notices had not been made public. The call comes as a Senate committee prepares to open hearings on Tuesday on how Wall Street has extended its reach beyond banking and into global markets for essential commodities. The panel is expected to focus on how banks have taken advantage of loosened federal regulation to buy warehouses, pipelines, oil tankers and other infrastructure used to store basic goods and deliver them to consumers.
0~Why Does Israel Have So Many Elections?~JERUSALEM — Israel’s lawmakers voted on Thursday to dissolve Parliament and bring down the government led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a year after he took office. That prompted Israel’s fifth election in less than four years, now set for Nov. 1. Mr. Bennett’s coalition had started out with a razor-thin majority but recently lost it, making it impossible to govern. The new election will give Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and now the leader of the opposition, the chance for a comeback even as he is on trial battling corruption charges. Still, his path back to power is far from assured. Israel has a new, if temporary, prime minister, Yair Lapid, a centrist who will head the caretaker government. He is expected to remain in office through the election and the subsequent period of negotiations that are usually required to form a new governing coalition commanding at least 61 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. Israel’s yearslong political morass is far from over. Here are some of the reasons. What kind of government does Israel have? Israel is a parliamentary democracy with an electoral system of proportional representation. No single party has ever won enough votes for an outright majority in Parliament. Instead, the larger parties must form coalitions by enlisting the support of smaller parties that negotiate to protect their narrow interests and often end up wielding disproportionate power.
0~The Upper Crust in a Tectonic Plate Collision~Q. The recent earthquakes in Nepal made me wonder: When tectonic plates collide, what determines which one winds up on top? A. “The short answer is buoyancy,” said Colin P. Stark, an associate research professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. Oceanic plates and continental plates have different levels of buoyancy, he said, and when they collide, the continental plate comes out on top. Earth is losing heat to space, Dr. Stark said. “This heat loss has created a cold, rigid skin called the lithosphere, a fancy name for the layer that forms the tectonic plates,” he said. The lithosphere, which is about 62 miles thick, lies above and slides over mantle rocks, which are warmer and weaker and flow slowly as they transfer heat from the core, about 1,865 miles below. The mantle is fluidlike but not liquid, Dr. Stark said.
0~Obamacare’s Insurance Mandate Is Unpopular. So Why Not Just Get Rid of It?~But there’s a reason that Obamacare’s authors kept a provision so unpleasant and unpopular. And there’s a reason the budget office said that cutting it would save so much money. Without the mandate, economic studies have suggested, fewer healthy people would buy health insurance. Their exit from the market would raise insurance prices, driving out still more healthy people in an unhappy spiral of rising prices and lower rates of insurance coverage. The mandate was often compared to one support in a three-legged stool that made Obamacare work: Knock it out, and the whole apparatus would tip over, broken and useless. That was the logic that persuaded Mr. Romney to put the mandate in his health bill, and the thinking that persuaded President Obama to change his mind and put it in the Affordable Care Act. Without the mandate, the C.B.O. has said for years, premiums would spike, and millions fewer Americans would have health insurance. The budget office’s most recent estimate, published last week, said that the ranks of the uninsured would rise by 13 million over 10 years, and that average premiums would be 10 percent higher than under current law. If you wanted health reform to work, the thinking went, you needed to eat the broccoli of the individual mandate, so you could then enjoy the dessert of a health care system accessible to people with pre-existing illnesses. (Much of the debate during oral argument at the Supreme Court focused on hypothetical broccoli-purchase mandates.)
0~Need a Mental Health Day? Some States Give Students the Option~Depression and anxiety. The state of the country. Climate change. Mass shootings. Today’s students are grappling with a variety of issues beyond the classroom. To that end, lawmakers in two states have recently recognized the importance of the mental health of their students by allowing them to take sick days just for that. The measures “empower” children to take care of their mental health, one expert said. On July 1, a law in Oregon went into effect giving students five mental health days in a three-month period. In 2018, Utah changed the definition of a student’s “valid excuse” to miss a day to include an illness “which may be mental or physical.” According to a recent study, teenagers named depression as a problem among their peers. Others blamed their anxiety on politics or climate change. In Oregon, the bill was supported by several teenagers. One recent graduate, Hailey Hardcastle, told The Associated Press that the bill was inspired by politically active students in Parkland, Fla., and that she and her peers wanted to address mental health issues in schools.
0~Some Vaccine Makers Say They Plan to Profit From Coronavirus Vaccine~Executives from four companies in the race to produce a coronavirus vaccine — AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics and Pfizer — told lawmakers on Tuesday that they are optimistic their products could be ready by the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2021. All four companies are testing vaccines in human clinical trials. Three of the firms — AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna — are getting federal funds for their vaccine development efforts. AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson pledged to the lawmakers that they would produce hundreds of millions of doses of their vaccines at no profit to themselves. Moderna, however, which has been granted $483 million from the government to develop its product, made no such promise. “We will not sell it at cost,” said Dr. Stephen Hoge, the president of Moderna. Many Democratic lawmakers have argued that federal funding for vaccine development should include provisions to guarantee affordability and guard against profiteering. At the Congressional hearing on Tuesday, some House members raised concerns about Pfizer’s decision to reject federal funds, suggesting it could lead to price-gouging and a lack of transparency.
0~Children May Carry Coronavirus at High Levels, Study Finds~It has been a comforting refrain in the national conversation about reopening schools: Young children are mostly spared by the coronavirus and don’t seem to spread it to others, at least not very often. But on Thursday, a study introduced an unwelcome wrinkle into this smooth narrative. Infected children have at least as much of the coronavirus in their noses and throats as infected adults, according to the research. Indeed, children younger than age 5 may host up to 100 times as much of the virus in the upper respiratory tract as adults, the authors found. That measurement does not necessarily prove children are passing the virus to others. Still, the findings should influence the debate over reopening schools, several experts said. “The school situation is so complicated — there are many nuances beyond just the scientific one,” said Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, who led the study, published in JAMA Pediatrics.
0~SoftBank’s $100 Billion Investment Fund Starts to Take Shape~Mr. Misra was part of a small group of derivatives specialists who left Merrill Lynch in the mid-1990s to create Deutsche Bank’s powerful global markets division. He was in many ways the founding father of the Deutsche Bank’s headlong — and ultimately contentious — dive into the structuring and selling of exotic investments like credit derivatives and securitized mortgages. To a degree, there is a bit of a start-up feel to the fund’s investment team. With just weeks to go before the fund can start investing, the Deutsche Bank veterans — who will be supported by SoftBank analysts in San Francisco and Tokyo — are still settling into their new offices in London’s exclusive Mayfair district. The team has already received a deluge of résumés, investor pitches and queries from bankers and lawyers — all looking to get a piece of the largest fund start in recent memory. Mr. Misra will be joined by Akshay Naheta, a former proprietary trader at Deutsche Bank and founder of Knight Assets, an activist investment firm based in London; and Saleh Romeih, another senior banker from Deutsche Bank. Working with Mr. Misra and his team will be a group of senior SoftBank deal makers who, over the years, have worked closely with Mr. Son as he has built up his portfolio of investments. They include Alok Sama, chief financial officer for SoftBank International; Ronald Fisher, a board member who has been deeply involved with SoftBank’s Sprint stake; and Deep Nishar, a former top executive at Linkedin. Mr. Son, Mr. Misra and Mr. Fisher will be the key members of the investment committee. Bankers expect that the total investment staff will include about 100 people. From the outset, growth has been the common theme in regard to investment strategy. That means that when the SoftBank fund takes a company private, it will not be slashing thousands of jobs to claim efficiencies or to meet interest payments on the loans that backed the deal.
0~Macron the Disrupter Seeks Direction~PARIS — A man of perpetual motion, President Emmanuel Macron of France finds himself in an uneasy state of drift. Five months into his second and final five-year term, he wants to forge his legacy, but seems unsure which way to move. He promised “a new era” when re-elected in April, but new limits on his power and cascading crises have nudged the transformative off the agenda. Mr. Macron, whose every instinct is to play offense, has been pushed into a defensive crouch. His government, at enormous cost, has capped gas and electricity price increases that would otherwise hit 120 percent by next year. It has requisitioned refinery workers in an attempt to break a crippling strike that has led to mile-long lines at gas stations. Deprived of the absolute parliamentary majority he had in his first term, seeking new ways to connect with a restive nation, buffeted by Russia’s war in Ukraine and threats from one leftist leader to outdo the 1789 revolution, Mr. Macron seems hesitant. But despite everything, he has lost none of his ambition to remake the world. At 44, he nurses a sweeping agenda: to build a new France at the heart of a strong and autonomous Europe, emancipated from the United States, delivered from fossil fuels, freed from the threat of a far-right takeover — a nation that punches above its weight and controls its 21st-century fate.
0~Biden Signs Bill Addressing Hate Crimes Against Asian-Americans~Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:36 - 0:00 transcript Biden Welcomes Cease-Fire Between Israel and Hamas President Biden said on Thursday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a “mutual, unconditional” cease-fire and expressed condolences to the families of the victims of the worst fighting in years in the region. Folks, I just spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Earlier today, I spoke with the President al-Sisi of Egypt. Prime Minister Netanyahu informed me that Israel has agreed to a mutual, unconditional cease-fire to begin in less than two hours. The Egyptians have now informed us that Hamas and the other groups in Gaza have also agreed. My conversation with President Netanyahu — I commend him for the decision to bring the current hostilities to a close within less than 11 days. The United States fully supports Israel’s right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks from Hamas and other Gaza- based terrorist groups that have taken the lives of innocent civilians in Israel. I extend my sincere gratitude to President al-Sisi and the senior Egyptian officials who played such a critical role in this diplomacy. I also appreciate the contributions of other parties in the region who have been engaged in working toward the end of hostilities. These hostilities have resulted in the tragic deaths of so many civilians, including children. And I send my sincere condolences to all the families, Israeli and Palestinian, who have lost loved ones and my hope for a full recovery for the wounded. I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity and democracy. My administration will continue our quiet, relentless diplomacy toward that end. President Biden said on Thursday that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a “mutual, unconditional” cease-fire and expressed condolences to the families of the victims of the worst fighting in years in the region. Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden praised what he described as a “mutual, unconditional” cease-fire between Israel and Hamas on Thursday, sending his condolences to “all the families, Israeli and Palestinian,” who endured some of the worst fighting the region has seen in years. “I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely,” Mr. Biden said during brief remarks delivered at the White House, “and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity and democracy.” Mr. Biden’s appearance in the East Room was quickly arranged after Hamas and Israel confirmed that they had agreed to a cease-fire mediated by Egypt — a de facto intermediary since the two groups do not deal directly with each other — to begin on Friday morning. Mr. Biden did not answer questions from reporters about whether he believed the agreement to draw down the violence would hold. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel had cautioned that “the reality on the ground will determine the continuation of the campaign.” In the hours before the cease-fire announcement, Mr. Biden held a call with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt to discuss the possibility of brokering an end to more than 10 days of violence between Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza, and the Israelis. Mr. Biden had in recent days spoken six times, and on increasingly blunt terms, with Mr. Netanyahu, warning him that he could not withstand mounting international criticism of the Gaza strikes for long. In his remarks, Mr. Biden said he had also spoken with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian National Authority. The president’s advisers said he believed he could quietly push Mr. Netanyahu, whom he has known for 40 years, to bring an end to violence that has killed more than 230 people in Gaza and 12 in Israel, many of them civilians. But the cease-fire failed to materialize directly after their latest phone call on Wednesday, when Mr. Biden said he expected a significant de-escalation in violence that day. Amid mounting international pressure to find a resolution to the violence and direct appeals from some Democrats, White House officials on Thursday found themselves having to explain that Mr. Biden’s choice to speak carefully in public and forcefully in private had been the best approach. For his part, Mr. Biden on Thursday appeared eager to emphasize that “quiet, relentless diplomacy” had led to the cease-fire. “We have believed that they are in a position to start winding their operations down,” said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, though the administration’s readout of a Wednesday call held by the two leaders had been framed with much more direct language. “And certainly that is what we’ve been conveying.” When asked why Mr. Biden had waited until Thursday to hold a call with Mr. Sisi, Ms. Psaki said that the administration’s approach to diplomacy “does not always require a call from a global leader.” Earlier in the day, Kamala Harris, the vice president, held a call with King Abdullah II of Jordan, to brief him “on our intensive diplomatic efforts to support the path to a cease-fire in Gaza,” she said in a tweet. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, speaking to reporters while on a trip to Greenland, said that he would be “prepared at any time to go to Israel” or to parts of the Middle East “if that would serve the purpose of moving beyond violence and helping to work on improving lives for Israelis and Palestinians alike.” “There’s a deep and shared concern around the world for the deaths of Palestinians and innocent Israelis, and that our goal continues to be to stop the violence, bring calm, and then get back to work, trying to build lasting stability and a more hopeful future,” Mr. Blinken said.
0~Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin’s~Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of such a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly and more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen. But Ethereum has also won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to the virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts. The system is complicated enough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain English. But one application in development would let farmers put their produce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from consumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications built on Ethereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and even Ponzi schemes. All of this work is still very early. The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could face some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished Bitcoin. Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems than Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far, Ethereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin. The novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities given that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be written directly into the Ethereum system.
0~Trump Administration Stalls Largest Tech Merger in New Sign of Protectionism~Experts said they couldn’t recall another instance of the committee’s intervening in a transaction that hadn’t been completed, much less one that is as fluid and bitterly contested as this one. Broadcom unveiled its bid for Qualcomm in November. Together, the two make chips for most of the world’s smartphones, and a merger would be the largest technology deal in history. But Qualcomm rebuffed the approach, arguing that Broadcom was fundamentally underestimating the company’s value. Broadcom had sought to pave the way for its bid by changing its headquarters to the United States, an announcement that the company’s chief executive, Hock Tan, made alongside Mr. Trump at the White House last year. Mr. Trump hailed the relocation as a sign that the United States business climate was improving under his watch. Broadcom argued that its status as a soon-to-be-American company meant the Qualcomm deal should not be subject to review by Cfius. Qualcomm nonetheless appealed to regulators to get involved. The committee, which is made up of officials from agencies including the Treasury, Commerce, Defense, State and Justice Departments, ultimately concluded that it had the authority to order the 30-day delay of the shareholder meeting. The Trump administration has been under intense pressure from lawmakers in recent weeks to block Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm on the grounds that the acquisition could threaten national security and cripple America’s ability to compete with China in the race for telecommunications supremacy. “Qualcomm’s work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company — and in a hostile takeover, no less,” said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas. “I would like to see Cfius more active especially regarding China and regarding critical industries.”
0~La fuga del Chapo aumenta la frustración y el cinismo en México~“Es increíble”, dijo Alma Camarena Díaz, de 54 años, en la Ciudad de México. “El nivel de corrupción en este país. Está simplemente en todas partes”. Guzmán, que se cree está próximo a cumplir los 60 años, ascendió en las filas de los grupos del narcotráfico de México para encabezar el Cártel de Sinaloa, el más poderoso del país y, según autoridades estadounidenses, la fuente de la mayor cantidad de drogas que ingresa a Estados Unidos. Es un personaje del bajo mundo de proporciones míticas y ya había escapado de prisión una vez antes, dándole sobornos a guardias y, según algunas versiones, ocultándose en un carrito de lavandería. Su fuga también ha sido un golpe para la principal estrategia en la guerra contra las drogas del país, junto con Estados Unidos, de ir tras los líderes de las violentas pandillas del narcotráfico. “La guerra contra las drogas se está descarrilando, y no solo en México”, dice Jeremy McDermott, director de InsightCrime, un grupo de investigación basado en Medellín, que da seguimiento al crimen organizado en el continente. McDermott señaló los acontecimientos recientes en la región que han socavado el antiguo consenso sobre cómo combatir al tráfico de drogas, incluida la creciente producción de cocaína en Colombia pese a años de esfuerzos de interdicción; la reciente decisión del gobierno colombiano de suspender la fumigación aérea de los cultivos de drogas en el país, y un giro en Estados Unidos que incluye la legalización de la marihuana en varios estados. Pero en México, la atención se centró en Peña Nieto y la incapacidad del país para superar los arraigados males de corrupción e impunidad, y un estado de derecho fallido. El arresto de Guzmán en 2014 realizado por las autoridades mexicanas, con ayuda de inteligencia de Estados Unidos, fue en su momento una victoria para Peña Nieto, quien intentó usarlo como una demostración de la eficacia de su gobierno.
0~How the Capitol Riot Suspects Are Challenging the Charges~At this stage of what is shaping up to be a marathon legal process, the government’s most prominent cases have been filed against the Oath Keepers, a militia that recruits former military and law enforcement officers, and the Proud Boys, an organization of leftist-hating brawlers that slyly bills itself as defending “Western” values. Prosecutors have repeatedly said an array of electronic communications — Facebook messages, online meeting room chats and conversations on a digital walkie-talkie app — show that the groups conspired not only internally to storm the Capitol, but may also have coordinated with each other. But now that the government is turning over evidence, lawyers for the extremist groups have attacked these theories of conspiracy, and judges have showed signs they agree. Lawyers for the Oath Keepers, for instance, claim that the evidence shows that many of the dozen militia members now facing charges didn’t go to Washington with a plan to storm the Capitol, but went instead to protect high-profile Republicans like Roger J. Stone Jr., the onetime adviser to former President Donald J. Trump. Lawyers for the Proud Boys assert that the group’s internal chats show that members had not planned to assault the Capitol, but had merely prepared to defend themselves against the leftist protesters with whom they had sparred at previous rallies in the city in November and December. Other legal issues in other cases present a more systemic threat. A lawyer for a Texas winemaker, Christopher Grider, filed a motion late last month to dismiss one of the charges he is facing: obstruction of a government proceeding. If Mr. Grider’s motion succeeds, it could have a chilling, even crippling, effect on dozens of cases against defendants facing similar charges. The law in question, which carries a penalty of 20 years in prison, makes it illegal to interfere with an official proceeding related to the “administration of justice,” Mr. Grider’s lawyer, Brent Mayr, wrote. It was meant to stop people from obstructing with matters like a criminal or congressional investigation, but was not intended to cover proceedings like the certification of a presidential vote, a largely ministerial event, Mr. Mayr argued.
0~F.D.A. Aims to Slash Nicotine Levels in Cigarettes~Experts said that determined smokers might seek to buy high-nicotine cigarettes on illegal markets or across the borders in Mexico and Canada. The F.D.A. would likely have to overcome opposition from the tobacco industry, which has already begun pointing out the reasons the agency cannot upend an $80 billion market. Legal challenges could take years to resolve, and the agency may give the industry five or more years to make the changes. The effort to lower nicotine levels follows a proposed rule announced in April that would ban menthol-flavored cigarettes, which are heavily favored by Black smokers. That proposal was also hailed as a potential landmark advance for public health and has already drawn tens of thousands of public comments. The F.D.A. is bound to review and address those comments before finalizing the rule. Other major tobacco initiatives outlined in the landmark 2009 Tobacco Control Act have been slow to take shape. A lawsuit delayed a requirement for tobacco companies to put graphic warnings on cigarette packs. And the agency recently said it would take up to another year to finalize key decisions on which e-cigarettes might remain on the market. A statement from the tobacco company Altria, the maker of Marlboro, offered a preview of arguments that opponents are expected to make against any rule that drastically slashes nicotine levels. “The focus should be less on taking products away from adult smokers and more on providing them a robust marketplace of reduced harm FDA-authorized smoke-free products,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. “Today marks the start of a long-term process, which must be science-based and account for potentially serious unintended consequences.” RAI Services, the parent company of RJ Reynolds, declined to comment on the announcement, but said: “Our belief is that tobacco harm reduction is the best way forward to reduce the health impacts of smoking.” Altria and RAI Services have previously warned that a standard that makes tobacco unappealing to adult smokers would be considered a cigarette ban and would violate tobacco control laws.
0~Facebook Isn’t Just Violating Our Privacy~Some of the dark Facebook ads, bought by suspected Russian fronts, have been released as part of congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, and these include an ad meant to depress black support for Hillary Clinton by referring to conspiracy theories involving her husband. What other dark Facebook ads might have been placed on behalf of the Trump campaign to suppress black turnout? Were there classic examples of voter suppression, like publishing the wrong Election Day date or falsely warning that you can be arrested at your polling place if you owe payment on a traffic ticket? We don’t know — the dark ads have disappeared and Facebook won’t release them, citing the privacy of its advertisers. Facebook’s vast and well-designed platform offered the Trump campaign and its supporters cheap, direct access to African-American voters — and along with this the chance to mislead and intimidate. In the past, candidates intent on suppressing the black vote ran up against technological barriers. They had to work with fliers and obscure radio ads, since reputable media outlets, unlike Facebook, tended to push back against racially inflammatory, untrue political advertising. Fliers and radio ads leave a public residue, too. The election of 2016, the first after Barack Obama’s presidency, was notable for a seven-percentage-point decrease in African-American turnout, from 66.6 percent in 2012 to 59.6 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. This was the first decline in 20 years in a presidential election and the largest ever recorded. The 2016 turnout rate was also below even the rate for the 2004 election, when John Kerry was the Democratic candidate. At a hearing with the top lawyers from Facebook, Google and Twitter about Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota began by emphasizing the stakes involved. “I come at this with the simple idea that our democracy was formed to be self-governing,” she said, adding that American citizens have “a right of freedom to make their own decisions — and I think that was interfered with by Russians and also others.” This simple idea of the United States as a self-governing community wasn’t the focus of the many mea culpa interviews Mr. Zuckerberg gave after reports of the data breach. He was focused on the individual. “A lot of the most sensitive issues that we faced today are conflicts between our real values, right?” he said in an interview with Recode. “Freedom of speech and hate speech and offensive content. Where is the line, right?” Todd A. Cox, the director of policy of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, sees the question of our “real values” a bit differently. “There has been a lot of agonizing and struggling over the place of First Amendment,” he told me. “I would like the discussion to turn on what role does the 14th Amendment, the Voting Rights Act, 15th Amendment play” — the guarantees of equal protection under the law and of the right of African-Americans to vote. That is, in addition to Facebook’s libertarian, Silicon Valley perspective that sees only the personal questions — my right to say what I want, my privacy — we must consider the collective questions: How do we protect historically discriminated groups? How do first we make sure everyone is able to speak through free, fair elections before we argue about what they can say? This week, Facebook delayed the release of its home assistant devices and unveiled yet another attempt to make its privacy settings clear and easy to use. “We’ve heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other important tools are too hard to find, and that we must do more to keep people informed,” Facebook’s chief privacy officer, Erin Egan, and deputy general counsel, Ashlie Beringer, said in a statement announcing the new privacy system. Facebook is insistent on seeing its failures as harming individuals, never society as a whole. The legal scholar Alexander Bickel was fond of saying, “No answer is what the wrong question begets.” Facebook has been asking the wrong question consistently for more than a decade, which is why its privacy scandals can seem like the longest running show in Silicon Valley. Recent events have offered us a chance to reframe the question about how to fix Facebook. It is one that all Americans should have a voice in answering.
0~For Theresa May, Still at Odds With Parliament, the Brexit Walls Are Closing In~“There has to be a crisis for positions to evolve,” he added. To keep alive any hope of passing her plan, Mrs. May needs to limit the size of any defeat next week, but it is not clear how she can. Concessions that she hoped might calm fears over the so-called backstop plans to keep goods flowing through the Irish border were dismissed as “cosmetic and meaningless,” by Nigel Dodds, the deputy leader of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 lawmakers normally support Mrs. May’s government. In desperation, Mrs. May seems to be reaching out to pro-Brexit lawmakers with the opposition Labour Party by dropping hints that the government might accept amendments to her Brexit plan that would protect workers’ rights and the environment. She also made rare calls to two union bosses, though to no avail. And most Labour lawmakers would require a much bigger shift of policy to consider supporting the government, if they are persuadable at all. Another part of her strategy is looking less convincing by the day. Mrs. May argues that her deal, a fuzzy compromise that would maintain some close ties to the European Union, is the only alternative either to an economically catastrophic “cliff edge” rupture, or canceling Brexit altogether. But opponents of leaving without an agreement, the no-deal option, seem to have a good chance of blocking that avenue before the end date on March 29. On Tuesday they showed their strength by defeating the government over an amendment that restricts its ability to spend money on planning for such a departure. Adding to the gloom, Jaguar Land Rover said it would cut 4,500 jobs, as car sales have faltered not just in China, one of its prime markets, but also at home. The company has also complained about uncertainty over Brexit, which could pose a particular threat to automakers because of their complex supply chains.
0~Obamacare’s Survival Is Now Assured, but It Still Has One Big Problem~But some Democrats quietly express reluctance about spending billions to fix a coverage gap created by Republican governors and legislatures when that money could go to other health care priorities. Democrats are also considering expanding Medicare, which provides coverage to older Americans, by lowering the eligibility age to 60 and covering additional benefits. For middle-class Americans, Democrats want to make Obamacare subsidies more generous in a coming legislative package. “There are many competing priorities,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, who introduced Medicaid expansion legislation this month. “I’m not opposed to doing the other things, which are also very expensive, but just saying don’t leave out the economically disadvantaged.” Fixing the Medicaid expansion gap may face long political odds because it targets benefits to a smaller group of people in states that typically vote Republican. Only three Democratic senators — Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, both of Georgia, and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin — represent a state that hasn’t expanded Medicaid. “If you were thinking in strictly political terms, advocating for Medicare expansion has a lot more political gold than Medicaid expansion,” said Joaquin Castro, a Democratic congressman from Texas, which has nearly 1.5 million people shut out of Medicaid eligibility, the most of any state. “But that is why we as Democrats need to redouble our efforts to focus on this vulnerable population.” How to bring coverage to Americans in those 12 states is a problem that the creators of the Affordable Care Act never anticipated. The original law expanded Medicaid in all states to cover Americans earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line ($17,420 for an individual as of 2021) and required states to provide some funding. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that provision unconstitutional and instructed the government to make the program optional.
0~Ime Udoka Has Convinced the Celtics to Pass the Basketball~BOSTON — Ime Udoka has been emphasizing ball movement since the day the Celtics hired him as their coach. At his introductory news conference last June, Udoka apologized to Brad Stevens, his predecessor and the team’s newly appointed president of basketball operations, as a way of softening the blow before he pointed out that the Celtics had ranked near the bottom of the league in assists last season. “We want to have more team basketball,” Udoka said at the time. It was not instant fix for Udoka, whose team hobbled into the middle of January with a losing record. The ball was not moving. A bit of frustration was evident. But even during their struggles, Udoka sensed that his players were receptive to coaching, he said. So he reinforced his pass-first concepts in film sessions and by citing statistics that showed the offense was more potent when the ball zipped around the court. “It took some time,” Udoka said on Wednesday, “but I think they’re embracing being playmakers and helping everyone else score, and I think it’s pleasing to me and noticeable when we play that way.” Entering the N.B.A.’s All-Star break, the Celtics have resurfaced as one of the better teams in the league after winning 11 of their last 13 games, a run of solid play that has vaulted them up the standings, quieted a few of their critics and shown that Udoka’s sharing-is-caring formula can work in their favor.
0~Officer Peter Liang Convicted in Fatal Shooting of Akai Gurley in Brooklyn~A New York City police officer was convicted of manslaughter on Thursday for killing an unarmed man who was hit by a ricocheting bullet fired from the officer’s gun in the stairwell of a Brooklyn housing project in a case that highlighted concerns over police accountability. The officer, Peter Liang, and his partner were conducting a so-called vertical patrol on Nov. 20, 2014, inside the Louis H. Pink Houses in the East New York neighborhood. At one point, Officer Liang opened a door into an unlighted stairwell and his gun went off. The bullet glanced off a wall and hit Akai Gurley, 28, who was walking down the stairs with his girlfriend, and pierced his heart. Mr. Liang, a rookie officer who had graduated from the Police Academy the year before the shooting, was also found guilty of official misconduct for failing to help Mr. Gurley as he lay on a fifth-floor landing. Mr. Gurley’s girlfriend, Melissa Butler, had testified that while she knelt in a pool of his blood trying to resuscitate him, the officer stopped briefly but did not help before proceeding down the stairs. The verdict, delivered in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, comes amid a national debate on the policing of black neighborhoods after a string of killings of unarmed black men by police officers. And the jury’s decision is a rare instance in which a police officer was convicted of killing someone in the line of duty.
